04/15/88  UNIX/Multics Differences

The following differences from UNIX CURSES can be expected in the
Multics CURSES library.

The default output mode for Multics is different than it is on a UNIX
system.  For this reason, the default action of initscr and setupterm
now includes initializing the proper modes for Multics.  Endwin and
resetterm will reset the modes on exit.

The user must ensure that the above entrypoints are called to
initialize and exit CURSES.


The handling of signals such as INTR and QUIT are not inhibited by
raw mode, although the suspend characters are passed through
unprocessed.

The usage of the entrypoints delay_output or _delay is strongly
discouraged due to the default character delays in place in the
Multics environment.  The use of an additional delay would alter the
expected response drastically.

Usage of the multiple terminal handling capabilities of CURSES will
not work on Multics; the user will not have the ability to access
multiple terminals.  However, the program may be altered to use
message segments or some other Multics capability to perform its
communication.


The user can set the terminal type via the setenv command.  For
example, "setenv TERM=vt102".
