The C runtime on Multics has had two incompatible changes made for
MR12.2.  These changes are in two parts 1) changes made to support
the System V varying argument macros and 2) changes made to the
base level I/O to support O_APPEND and other device dependant
operations.

1) Users who have altered programs to use a Multics specific version of
varargs.h will now recieve incompatible type warnings from the compiler
on the lines of their programs that use va_arg. There are two choices
available to the user concering this incompatible change. a) the user
can compile their programs defining Multics_Obsolete_Vargargs (ie
compile with -def Multics_Obsolete_Varargs) or b) the user can alter
their program to remove usages of get_arg and remove the extra
redirection on usages of va_arg. If any part of a program is changed to
use the System V version of varargs then the whole program will have to
be changed to use the System V version of varargs.

2) Users who alter C programs compiled prior to MR12.2 will have to
recompile the whole program due to incompatible changes made in the C
runtime I/O to support device dependent operations like O_APPEND. No
user modifications are required just a recompilation. Any local version
of stdio.h should be replaced with the new version.

CURSES support has been added to the C runtime in the form of a new
library named libcurses.archive located in >sl3p>cc>e.

lint and make have been ported for MR12.2 and can be found in
>sl3p>cc>e.



BUG FIXES

1) A bug in "float/double" to integral type conversions has been fixed.
2) A bug in "unsigned int" to "float/double" conversions have been fixed.
3) A bug to correct some cases of floating point operations have been
   fixed.


Probe support is now supported by the compiler and can be found in
>sl3p>cc>e.

C argument handling ha been changed to increase porting success by
being more compatible with current C programming practices.
