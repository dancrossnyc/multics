Name:
	tic - terminfo compiler


Synopsis:

	tic [ -v[n] ] file  ...

Tic translates terminfo files from the source format into the compiled
format.  The results are placed in the directory >sl3p>cc>e>terminfo.

The -v (verbose) option causes tic to output trace information showing
its progress.  If the optional integer is appended, the level of
verbosity can be increased.

Tic compiles all terminfo descriptions in the given files.  When a
use= field is discovered, tic searches first the current file, then
the master file, which is >sl3p>cc>e>terminfo>terminfo.scr


If the environment variable TERMINFO is set, the results are placed
there instead of >sl3p>cc>e>terminfo.

Limitations include total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes;
the name field cannot exceed 128 bytes.


Files:

>sl3p>cc>e>terminfo>*>*   	compiled terminal cabability data base
