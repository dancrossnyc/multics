   DIRECTORY Multics_sources

  Directories :

     * [3]Multics
     * [4]ldd_listings

   INSTRUCTIONS for USE

   At the top of the page is the name of the current directory .

   Underneath, could appear the two titles Files or Directories .
   Under Files , if present, appear the names of the files contained in
   the current directory . Depending on the type of the file as viewed by
   the user file system, when clicking on the name of the file, four types
   of action could happen :

     The automatic display of the content of this file .
     * The automatic display of the content of this file by an editor (
       Wordpad or Word if you use Windows ) .
     * The automatic display of a window asking two questions :

     * Either to display the file by an editor ( Wordpad or Word if you
       use Windows ) ;
     * Or to copy the file somewhere in the user system .

   If needed, binary files can be always copied somewhere to be analized
   using some byte editor like Hexplorer .

   Under Directories , if present, appear the names of the directories
   contained in the current directory . Remember that Multics directories
   have been reorganized in three types of directories :
     * Multics directories, restricted to the ASCII files contained in the
       original Multics directory;
     * binaries directories containing the binary files of the upper
       Multics directory ;
     * damaged directories containing the damaged files of the upper
       Multics directory ( due to conversion or disk errors at Calgary ) .

     Clicking on a directory reference will display the content of this
       new directory .

   To return to the upper directory, use your browser's BACK function ( if
   you use Internet Explorer under Windows, click as usual on the left
   arrow at the left up corner ) .

   HISTORICAL BACK GROUND

     * This edition of the Multics software materials and documentation is
       provided and donated to Massachusetts Institute of Technology by
       Group BULL including BULL HN Information Systems Inc. as a
       contribution to computer science knowledge .
     * This donation is made also to give evidence of the common
       contributions of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
       Laboratories, General Electric, Honeywell Information Systems Inc.,
       Honeywell BULL Inc., Groupe BULL and BULL HN Information Systems
       Inc. to the development of this operating system .
     * Multics development was initiated by Massachusetts Institute of
       Technology Project MAC (1963-1970) , renamed the MIT Laboratory for
       Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in the mid 1970s ,
       under the leadership of Professor Fernando Jose Corbato. Users
       consider that Multics provided the best software architecture for
       managing computer hardware properly and for executing programs.
       Many subsequent operating systems incorporated Multics principles.
     * Multics was distributed in 1975 to 2000 by Group Bull in Europe ,
       and in the U.S. by Bull HN Information Systems Inc., as successor
       in interest by change in name only to Honeywell Bull Inc. and
       Honeywell Information Systems Inc. .
     * To know more, look at [5]Multicians .

   ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

   The decision to retrocede the Multics Sources from Bull to MIT was made
   by Didier LAMOUCHE, President of Bull .

   The decision to create this Internet site was made by Jerry GROCHOW ,
   VP for Information Systems and Technology at MIT (Cambridge, MA) .
   The following Bull Managers have made possible the positive decision
   making on this project:
     * Gerard ROUCAIROL, Group Bull Chief Scientist, (Les
       Clayes-sous-Bois, France) .
     * Herve MOUREN, President of Bull Systems, (Les Clayes-sous-Bois,
       France) .
     * Matthew FOXTON, Group Bull VP for Communication, (Les
       Clayes-sous-Bois, France) .
     * Christian LOYAU, Group Bull General Counsel, (Les Clayes-sous-Bois,
       France) .
     * Henry PFAHL, GCOS Product Lines Director, (Les Clayes-sous-Bois,
       France) .
     * Bob FOWLER, Director, Customer Support & Quality, Bull HN
       Information Systems (Phoenix, AZ) .
     * Tom MAHER, Bull HN General Counsel, (Billerica, MA) .
     * Guy PROUD, Director of GCOS Development for Bull, (Phoenix, AZ, and
       Les Clayes-sous-Bois, France) .

   The achievement of this project would not be possible without the
   involvement of the following Engineers :
     * Tom VAN VLECK, Multicians site Manager, whose constant help to this
       project have made it to succeed. Tom has brought all his expertise
       on Multics, and also a large programmatic support in Perl to
       process the 14 384 files of Mutltics Sources presented here and in
       HTML to create this server. Great thanks to Tom.
     * David SCHROTH, who saved on a DAT the entire Multics Sources before
       the shutdown of the last Multics system running in CGI (Calgary,
       Canada). Whitout his intervention, Multics Sources would be lost.
       Special thanks to Dave and CGI.
     * Henrik CZAJA, SuperSelect engineer, who kept the DAT for two years
       .Thanks to Henrick .
     * Jacky BOULAY, Systems Operation, Bull Engineering, (Les
       Clayes-sous-Bois, France), who created the CDs from the David DAT .
       Thanks to Jacky .
     * Alain LEMOINE, Systems Operation, Bull Engineering, (Les
       Clayes-sous-Bois, France), who helped to correct characters changes
       by Windows from Unix . Thanks to Alain .
     * Patrick BIENATI, Systems Operation, Bull Engineering, (Les
       Clayes-sous-Bois, France), who helped in making the final delivered
       material . Thanks to Patrick .
