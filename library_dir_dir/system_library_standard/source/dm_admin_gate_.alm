" DESCRIPTION:
"
"	 This is the administrative gate for the data management system
"     (DMS).  Any manager specific entries will have the initials of the
"     manager prefixed to the entry's name (e.g., "lm_" for lock_manager_
"     entries). General DM inner ring calls will begin with "dm_".
"
"	 No part one DMS initialization procedure should go through this
"     (or any other) gate.  The main transfer vector for a manager should
"     directly call the initialization routine as the call MUST come from the
"     DM ring of execution.

" HISTORY:
" Written by M. Pandolf, 06/08/83.
" Modified:
" 08/17/83 by M. Pandolf:  to add set_journal_stamps.
" 01/03/84 by Lee A. Newcomb:  added lm_copy_data, lm_system_segment_count,
"	    and lm_reset_system_meters.
" 07/06/84 by Lindsey Spratt:  Added bjm_get_bj_path_from_uid.
" 09/17/84 by Matthew Pierret: Added schedule_shutdown.
" 09/27/84 by Lindsey Spratt:  Added dm_copy_log.
" 10/02/84 by Lee A. Newcomb:  Moved $dm_set_aim_dir to here from
"	    dm_daemon_gate_ and added $dm_create_aim_control_seg.
" 11/12/84 by Lindsey Spratt:  Renamed set_journal_stamps entry to
"	    dm_set_journal_stamps.
" 11/22/84 by Lee A. Newcomb:  Removed the obsolete dm_set_aim_dir and
"	    dm_create_aim_control_seg entries.
" 11/27/84 by Stanford S. Cox: Chg send* to xfer thru dm_firstref_tv_,
"	    chg send* to dm_send_= chg *inner_ring_tv_ to =firstref_tv_.
" 12/07/84 by Lindsey Spratt:  Changed dm_set_journal_stamps to tra to
"	    dm_no_firstref_tv_ instead of dm_firstref_tv_.
" 12/18/84 by Steve Herbst: Added entry points dlr_open, etc. for log reading.
" 01/16/84 by R. Michael Tague: Removed obsolete dm_send_* entries and added
"	    dm_send_new_process_notifies and dm_send_kill_txn.
" 02/19/85 by Steve Herbst: Fixed arg counts for dlr_open and dlr_hold_message.
" 03/25/85 by S. Cox:  Added lm_copy_fast_data.
