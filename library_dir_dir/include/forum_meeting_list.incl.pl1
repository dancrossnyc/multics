/* This include file declares the structure used to hold the results of the
   forum_check_meetings command.  It is pointed to by the external variable
   forum_data_$meeting_list.

   The array contains information about  'no_selected' meetings.  The 'order'
   array contains sorting information (alphabetical order by short name) that
   can be used in the following way:

   do idx = 1 to forums_array.no_selected;
      process (forums_array.forums (forums_array.forums(idx).order));
   end;

   The 'processed' flag should be set to indicate that this entry has
   been used.  The forum 'next_meeting' request obeys this protocol. */
