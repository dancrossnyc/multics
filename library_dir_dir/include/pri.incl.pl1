	/*
	     The 'print_relocation_info' command, also named 'pri', may be
	used to examine the relocation bits in an object segment.

	Usage

		pri  pathname  first_word  nwords  -option-

	     The relocation bits for the 'nwords' words starting at
	'first_word' are described. 'first_word' is given in octal.
	'nwords' is given in octal; if omitted, it is taken to be one.

	     The 'option' argument may actually appear anywhere on the
	command line (except first).  If it is missing or "-t", then 'first_word' is a
	reference to the text of 'pathname'.  If 'option' is "-l", then
	'first_word' is in the linkage section.  If 'option is "-s", then
	'first_word' is in the symbol-table section.
