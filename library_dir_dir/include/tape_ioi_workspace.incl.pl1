   *
   *	     Both structures are carefully packed into words, so care should be
   *	taken when modifying them.
   *
   *	     The workspace_max, workspace_len, and workarea_len must be at least one long.
   *	This allows us to store the value-1 and thus fit into 18 bits.
   *
   *	     None of the offsets (first_buf_off, statq_off, etc.) can be zero since the first
   *	word in the workspace contains the ioi_index.  This allows a zero offset
   *	to be used as a null offset indication.
   *
   *	     The data_code, cif_code, and tbi.state are encoded as follows:
   *
   *	data mode |                                                     buffer |
   *	setting   | data_code     cif_code |    Meaning		    state  | Meaning
   *	__________|__________     _________|_______________________     _______|________
   *	  bin     |   05            20     | no retry, high                1   | ready
   *	  bcd     |   04            21     | no retry, low                 2   | busy
   *	  tap9    |   03            22     | no retry, high, deskew        3   | suspended
   *	  asc     |   27            23     | no retry, low, deskew
   *	  ebc     |   24            30     | retry, high
   *	  a/e     |   25            31     | retry, low
   *			        32     | retry, high, deskew
   *			        33     | retry, low, deskew
   *
   *
   *	     Before data_code can be used for the command field in the IDCW the fourth
   *	bit (from the right) must be set to "0"b for read commands and to "1"b for write commands.
   *
   *	     The general layout of the workspace maintained by tape_ioi_ is as follows:
