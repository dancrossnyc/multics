/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE: dm_file_create_info.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:
     This include file contains the declaration of the file_create_info
     structure.  This structure is used to specify to file_manager_
     attributes a file is to have.
*/

/* HISTORY:
Written by Jeffery D. Ives, 09/16/82.
  (Original concept by Lindsey L. Spratt.)
Modified:
06/15/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Added ring_brackets. Changed to a char (8)
            version.
11/07/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Extended mbz_3 to by one word to cover the
            gap caused by the double-word alignment of mbz_2.
