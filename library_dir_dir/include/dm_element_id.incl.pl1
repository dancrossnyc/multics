/* DESCRIPTION:

        Contains the declaration of an element identifier.  Element
   identifiers consist of two parts, the id (number) of the control interval
   in which the element resides, and the index into the slot table of
   the element in the control interval.  The declaration of the element_id 
   structure reflects this division of the element identifier.  The structure 
   is based on the automatic bit string element_id_string because programs
   generally pass bit strings (element_id_string) to each other, then 
   interpret the bit string by overlaying the element_id structure ony if
   it is necessary to access the parts of the id.  Basing element_id on
   addr(element_id_string) instead of on a pointer removes the necessity
   for always setting that pointer explicitly and guarantees that changes
   made to the string or structure do not get inconsistent.

   Changes made to element_id must also be made to datum_id, declared in 
   dm_cm_datum.incl.pl1.
