/*
   HISTORY

   82-09-21 Davids: removed reference to the iocb_ind element which was the
   index in the rm_rel_info.iocb_ptr array of the iocb to be used and added
   the cursor_ptr element.
   
   82-10-1  Woodka: changed tid_array to be bit (36) aligned instead of 
   bit (36) unaligned. 

   82-10-22 Woodka : added first_seq_io bit and changed reserved to bit 32.

   82-10-26 Davids: added the record_collection_cursor_ptr element. This is
   needed because the relation manager get_tuple_by_id entry requires a 
   record collection cursor.

   83-05-03 Mike Kubicar : deleted the unused fields: thd_type, seq_io,
   seed_id, link_io, free_array and thd_ptr.  Added the maxtids field.

   83-05-31 Mike Kubicar : got rid of cursor_ptr and
   record_collection_cursor_ptr.  Inserted the field relation_cursor_ptr.
