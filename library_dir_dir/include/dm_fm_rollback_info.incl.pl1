/* DESCRIPTION:

   This include file contains the structures which define the rollback
   handlers for the creation and deletion of files.  They are used by
   file_manager_$undo.

   All structure elements are unaligned because we don't trust
   before_journal_manager_ to align the buffer in which it places
   the structure.
