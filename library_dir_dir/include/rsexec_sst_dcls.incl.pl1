/*
	The SST contains information about all of the auxiliary sockets used by RSEXEC requests.
	The local pin number is passed to foreign users as the HANDLE; this is used to index the
	SST array on subsequent references. Some less than obvious SST fields are :

		socket_usage	: state or usage of this socket, from above list

		unused_brother	: since Multics always views sockets as pairs, the
				  use of net_pin_manager_ results in the allocation
				  of two pins. However, RSEXEC requests only ask for
				  sockets one at a time. Thus, one of each pair allocated
				  by Multics is ignored; unused_brother is its pin number.

		listener_id_no	: each RSEXEC conversation is assigned a unique integer
				  identifier so that sockets belonging to that conver-
				  sation can be found.

		link_segment_ptr	: if this socket is in use for a link, this field
				  points to the <user>.ARPAnet_msgs segment involved in
				  this link.

		link_subscript_or_mode :
				  if socket is used for a link, this is the index of this
				  link in the ULT.link array. If used for file transfer,
				  this field is the mode specification.

		type_for_transfer	: if socket is used for file transfer, this is the type
				  specification.
