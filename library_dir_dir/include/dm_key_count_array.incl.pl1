  1) change(87-01-15,Hergert), approve(87-04-01,MCR7632),
     audit(87-02-09,Dupuis), install(87-04-02,MR12.1-1020):
     Added the KEY_COUNT_OFFSET_IN_CHARACTERS. This is the offset from the
     beginning of the structure to the element key_count_array.count in
     characters. Using this it is possible to calculate the key_count_array_ptr
     given the "addr (key_count_array.count (0))".

/* DESCRIPTION:

          The key_count_array holds counts of the number of unique key values
     in an index.  These values are used by the search optimization done by
     MRDS.  count(0) is the number of keys in the index.  count(N) is the
     number of keys in the index which have at least fields 1 through N
     having the same value as another key in the index, i.e. count(N)
     is the number of partial duplicates with number of partial
     duplication fields equal to N.
