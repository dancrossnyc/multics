 one_one   set to "1"b if transformation is (1-1)
 onto      set to "1"b if transformation is onto
 type      A numeric value which defines the alphabet type. The

 alf_size   The number of characters in the alphabet.
 char_size  The size of a character in bits.
 hi_value   The native value associated with the character
            having the highest ordinal position in the alphabet
 lo_value   The native value associated with the character
            having the lowest ordinal position in the alphabet
 to_table   key in variable common of table for translating
            from native to user defined alphabet
 from_table key in variable common of table for translating
            from user defined alphabet to native
 name_ptr   pointer to name table entry which defines the
            alphabet name.
