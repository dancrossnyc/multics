   Note that is fixed bin(17) aligned, as recieved from
   mrds_dsl_set_scope, thus the overlay is for a full 36 bit word.
   The scope modes are encoded as a sum of the individual permissions,
   with 1 => read_attr, 2 => append_tuple, 4 => delete_tuple, 8 => modify_attr,
   thus individual bits in the fixed bin word can be used for each mode
   These were known as r-s-m-d modes by old mrds users. */
