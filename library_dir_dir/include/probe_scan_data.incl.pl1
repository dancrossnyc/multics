/* Modified June 83 JMAthane to add PASCAL */
/* Added actions for COLON_CHAR_TYPE, default like OTHER_OPS_CHAR_TYPE 07/26/83 S. Herbst */
/* Changed action(7,3) to 71 so that . + . -> ..  03/09/84 S. Herbst */
/* Modified April 88 Hinatsu to add C char type, C action table */
/*  and <<,>>,==,!= to the double table */


/* for the 14 states and the 25 char types - the transfer table

   whats stored here is the subscript of the label constant in
   probe_scan_input_ to transfer to when a char of type T is read in
   state S.
