/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE dm_tm_shutdown_info.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:

	This contains the structure used to pass information from
     the DM ring to the user ring about a process' transactions that
     existed when the process terminated its usage of a Data
     Management System.
*/

/* HISTORY:
Written by Steve Herbst, 11/22/83.
Modified:
04/27/84 by L. A. Newcomb:  Renamed structure shutdown_info to
            tm_shutdown_info to prevent collision with system shutdown info
            structure.
05/16/84 by Steve Herbst:  Added ABANDONED constant.
09/20/84 by Lee A. Newcomb:  Added an abandoned entry to the OP_NAME array,
            aligned the version, and init'd tm_shutdown_info_ptr to null.
