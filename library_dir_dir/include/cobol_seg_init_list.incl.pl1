seg_init_list_ptr is a pointer upon which the structure
	        seg_init_list is based.  It is declared in
	          cobol_.incl.pl1

n	        is the number of COBOL segments containing
	        alterable GO's.  All fixed segments are counted
	        as one segment and assigned segment number 0.

extra	        available for future use.

seg	        is an array of seg_init_list.n structures which
	        contain information about the segments contain-
	        ing alterable GO's.  seg(1) always conatins
	        information about fixed segments if there are
	        any in the procedure.

priority	        is the COBOL segment number associated with
	        the "alterable" segment.

int_tag_no        is an internal tag number associated with the
	        first instruction of the code sequence generat-
	        ed to initialize the alterable GO's in the seg-
	        ment whose segment number is priority.  For
	        priority = 0, int_tag_no = 0 since initializa-
	        tion of alterable GO's in fixed segments is
	        accomplished by   cobol_prologue_gen.

no_gos	        is the number of alterable GO's in the segment
	        whose segment number is priority.

next_init_no      is the number of the next alterable GO in the
	        segment whose segment number is priority for
	        which initialization data entries are to be
	        made in an area reserved for that purpose.  The
	        base of this area is located by init_ptr.
	        1<_next_init_no<_no_gos.

init_ptr	        is a pointer to a block of 3 times no_gos words
	        reserved for the storage of initialization data
	        for the alterable GO's in the segment whose
	        segment number is priority.
