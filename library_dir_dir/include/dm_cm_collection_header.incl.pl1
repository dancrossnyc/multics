/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE - dm_cm_collection_header.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:
       Associated with each collection is the following collection_header
   structure stored as an element in the Header Collection of the file.
   The identifier of this element is also the idenfifier of the collection.
   Even the Header Collection has a collection_header stored in the Header
   Collection itself in the element identified by the constant
   HEADER_COLLECTION_HEADER_ELEMENT_ID declared in dm_cm_hdr_col_ids.incl.pl1.
   The information in collection_header is expected to be stable information.
   The structure elements are described as follows:
   
   version is a character string version equal to COLLECTION_HEADER_VERSION_2.
   
   flags.fixed_size_elements indicates, if on that all elements in the
   collection are of a fixed length.
   
   flags.thread_elements indicates that elements in a collection are to be
   threaded in a linked list.  This is currrently unupported.
   
   flags.thread_control_intervals indicates, if on, that control intervals in
   a collection are to be threaded in a linked list.  This is only useful if
   the control interval storage method is blocked.
   
   flags.must_be_zero1 is reserved for future use and must be "0"b.
   
   control_interval_storage_method is the method of storage management of
   control intervals for this collection, either
   BLOCKED_CONTROL_INTERVAL_STORAGE_METHOD (not yet supported) or
   UNBLOCKED_CONTROL_INTERVAL_STORAGE_METHOD, declared in
   dm_cism_info.incl.pl1.
   
   element_storage_method is the method of storage management of elements in
   this collection, either BASIC_ELEMENT_STORAGE_METHOD or
   ORDERED_ELEMENT_STORAGE_METHOD, declared in dm_esm_info.incl.pl1.
   
   maximum_element_size is the maximum size of an element in bits in this
   collection.
   
   header_record_element_id is the identifier of an element containing a
   caller-defined header for this collection.  If equal to "0"b, no
   caller-defined header yet exists.  The put_header collection_manager_
   operation stores such a header.
   
   storage_record_element_id is the identifier of the element containing the
   storage_record for this collection.  The storage_record contains
   information expected to be dynamic, such as the identifier of the last
   control interval of the collection.  Its format is also dependent upon the
   storage methods in effect for this collection.  storage_record structures
   are declared in dm_cm_storage_record.incl.pl1.
