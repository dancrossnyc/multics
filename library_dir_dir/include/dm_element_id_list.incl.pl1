/* DESCRIPTION:
          The element_id_list structure contains an array of element 
     identifiers.  These identifiers are used as tuple, record or 
     element identifiers.  This structure is used across the relation_manager_,
     record_manager_ and index_manager_ interfaces.  At some time the 
     version should be changed to be char(8)aligned, when such a conversion
     can be coordinated with the other structures used at these interfaces.
*/
