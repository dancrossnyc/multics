/* DESCRIPTION:

          There are two formats for keys, the leaf_key structure and the
     branch_key structure. The branch_key has two more pieces of information
     than the leaf_key. One is the control interval id of the
     node for all keys greater than the value of the branch key.  The other is
     the number of fields for which there are values in the "string" portion
     of the key.  This allows for the storing of only as much data as is needed
     to discriminate between the children being split by the branch key.
