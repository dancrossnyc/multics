/* HISTORY:

   81-01-20 Jim Gray : original created for the mmi_$get_authorization interface

*/

/* DESCRIPTION:

   this structure returns the callers user_class
   either database administrator or normal user.
   Note that these separate classes were used to allow
   future expansion to the user classes, rather than
   make them logical "not"'s of one another.
   NOTE: a DBA is always also a normal user, thus if the caller
   is a DBA, his normal_user bit will be on also.
