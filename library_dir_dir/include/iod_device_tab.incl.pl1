     Added comment, head_sheet, tail_sheet, paper_type, forms_table,
     forms_validation, font_dir variables to device entries in support of laser
     printers.  Changed driver_module, args to text_offset instead of strings.
     Added comment, default_form  to minor device entries.  Changed args in
     minor device entry to text_offset instead of string.
