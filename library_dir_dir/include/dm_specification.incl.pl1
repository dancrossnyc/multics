/* DESCRIPTION:

          The specification structure is used to identify sets items based on
     the value of some of the contents of the items (the
     search_specification), or based on the ordinal position (the
     numeric_specification) of the first or last item in the desired set of
     items in the set of all possible items.  It is used with the relation,
     index and record managers.  The items for these three managers are
     tuples, keys and records, respectively.  The sets of "all possible
     items", for determination of ordinal position for these three managers
     are: a relation, an index, and a record collection, respectively.
     
          The specification_head structure, in dm_specification_head.incl.pl1,
     must be included in any program which uses this (the
     dm_specification.incl.pl1) include file.

/* HISTORY:

Written by Lindsey Spratt, 05/19/82.
Modified:
08/17/82 by Matthew Pierret:  Added all specification type constants.
09/24/82 by Ronald Harvey: Changed version and added and_groups.
10/22/82 by Lindsey Spratt:  Added the range_size to the numeric_specification.
	  Changed the version to 3.
05/11/83 by Matthew Pierret: Moved specification_head and and type constants
            to dm_specification_head.incl.pl1. Added constraint.value_field_id.
            Moved range type constants into dm_range_constants.incl.pl1.
05/20/83 by Matthew Pierret: Added constraint.value_field_id for specifying
            intra-key/record compares.
10/02/84 by Lindsey L. Spratt:  Moved a misplaced journalization comment.
            Added a DESCRIPTION comment.
