Modified:
10/01/82 by Lee A. Newcomb:  To add n_txn to all records so rollback after
	  crash knows how many transactions were active at crash time.
15feb83  by M. Pandolf: To add fm_handler_rec for both rollback and postcommit
	  handler used exclusively by file_manager_, add BEGIN_COMMIT mark,
	  and add PREFORM_BEGIN mark (for housekeeping, never written).
05apr83 by M. Pandolf to add BEGIN_MARK for bj_txte.last_completed_operation
