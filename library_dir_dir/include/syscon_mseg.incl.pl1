/* Message Coordinator message segment declaration.  Each daemon process
   enqueues its messages in a segment like this one.

   The segment consists of a header followed by many message blocks,
   each  capable  of  holding  a  message  of  132  characters  plus
   information  on  when  the  message was sent, who it's from, etc.
   These blocks are "allocated" only as needed and placed on a  free
   storage list when freed.  Blocks in use are chained together in a
   first-in-first-out queue.   */
