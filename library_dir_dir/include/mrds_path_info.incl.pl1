/* HISTORY:

   81-01-22 Jim Gray : originaly created for the dsl_$get_path_info interface,
   a slight extension to the undocumented mrds_dsl_get_version$header.

*/

/* DESCRIPTION:

   This structure returns information about a relative pathname, given
   to a pathname accepting mrds interface. The information returned
   is the absolute pathname, plus in the case that
   the relative path points to a mrds database or submodel
   whether it is a model or a submodel, the mrds version of
   the model or submodel, it's creator, and the time of creation.
