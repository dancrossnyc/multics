/* DESCRIPTION:
This structure is used to locate an array of increment words to be used
in one or more postcommit handlers.  The structure elements have the following
meaning:
increments_ptr  - pointer to the structure containing the array of word
	        increment values in the users address space.
offset_in_bits  - is the offset from the begining of the structure to the
	        first word increment.  This value is also used to locate
	        the first word increment within the collection manager
	        element, that is, it is assumed that the structure
	        containing the increment words is stored in begining of
	        a collection manager element.
number_of_words - number of word increment values.
