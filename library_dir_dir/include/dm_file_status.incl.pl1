/* DESCRIPTION:

   This include file contains dm_file_status, the structure of information
   returned by file_manager_$status. The caller should pass the addr of an
   automatic copy as follows:

	dcl auto_dm_file_status aligned like dm_file_status;
	unspec (auto_dm_file_status) = "0"b;
	auto_dm_file_status.version = DM_FILE_STATUS_VERSION_1;
	call file_manager_$status (dirname, entryname,
	     addr (auto_dm_file_status, code);
*/
