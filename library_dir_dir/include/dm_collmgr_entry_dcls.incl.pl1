/* HISTORY:
Written by Matthew Pierret 
Modified:
04/14/82 by Lindsey Spratt: Changed the control_interval_id parameter of the
	  allocate_control_interval operation to be unaligned, as well as
	  unsigned.
06/17/82 by Matthew Pierret: Added the put_element_portion opertion and
            removed the beginning_location parameter from the put_element
            operation. Added the create_page_file_operation.
08/09/82 by Matthew Pierret: Changed "fixed bin (17)"s to "bit (36) aligned"s
            wherever collection_id was required.
            Also changed the control_interval_id parameter of the 
            allocate_control_interval operation back to be aligned. So there.
10/20/82 by Matthew Pierret: Changed $create_page_file to $create_file,
            added the argument file_create_info_ptr to $create_file.
12/13/82 by Lindsey Spratt:  Corrected $free_control_interval to
	  include the zero_on_free bit.
12/17/82 by Matthew Pierret: Added cm_$get_id.
01/07/83 by Matthew Pierret: Added cm_$put_element_buffered, 
            cm_$allocate_element_buffered, cm_$free_element_buffered.
04/27/83 by Matthew Pierret: Added cm_$put_unprotected_element,
            cm_$put_unprotected_header.
11/07/83 by Matthew Pierret: Added $get_element_portion_buffered,
             $simple_get_buffered_element.
02/08/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Changed $get_id to have only one bit(1)aligned
            parameter for specifying absolute/relative nature of search.
03/16/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Added cm_$get_control_interval_ptr,
            $get_element_ptr, $get_element_portion_ptr, $simple_get_element_ptr
04/03/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Added cm_$compact_control_interval.
06/06/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Re-named free_element* to delete and
            delete_from_ci_buffer.
            Re-named *_buffered_ci to =_ci_buffer.
            get entries.
            modify entries.
            Changed calling sequence of modify entries to have a ptr/length
            instead of length/ptr parameter pair.
03/11/85 by R. Michael Tague:  Added $postcommit_increments.
