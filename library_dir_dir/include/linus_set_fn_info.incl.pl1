   81-10-26  Rickie E.  Brinegar: Changed the entry pointer to entry variables
   and  added  bits to define whether or not the entry variables had been set.
   Renamed the structure from set_fn_info to linus_set_fn_info and the pointer
   that it was based on from setfi_ptr to linus_set_fn_info_ptr.

   81-11-05 Rickie E.  Brinegar: Changed the entry pointers to entry variables
   and  added bit switches to determine when the entries have or have not been
   set.  Renamed the set_fn_info structure to linus_set_fn_info, the setfi_ptr
   to      linus_set_fn_info_ptr,      and      nset_fn_info_init_args      to
   initial_number_of_set_fn_info_args.
