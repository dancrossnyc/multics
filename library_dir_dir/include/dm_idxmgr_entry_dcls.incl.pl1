/* DESCRIPTION:

          This include file has all of the declarations for the index_manager_
     external interface.  It is useful for programs which are making extensive
     use of the index_manager_ to include this include file rather than
     individually declaring each of the entries.
     
*/

/* HISTORY:

Written by Lindsey Spratt, 06/25/82.
Modified:
07/28/82 by Lindsey Spratt: Extended the create_collection entry calling
	  sequence to include the number_of_duplication_fields.
08/10/82 by Matthew Pierret: Changed the create_collection entry calling 
            sequence to return a "bit (36) aligned" collection id instead of
            "fixed bin (17)".  Changed create_cursor calling sequence likewise.
08/19/82 by Lindsey Spratt:  Renamed create_collection to create_index. Added
	  the put_key_array entry.  Added the id_list_ptr to the get_key
	  entry.  Added the create_subset_index entry.
08/23/82 by Lindsey Spratt:  Added the position_cursor entry.
09/27/82 by Lindsey Spratt:  Added the get_count and get_duplicate_key_count
	  entries.
11/09/82 by Lindsey Spratt:  Added ptr to get_key for the interval_list.
	  Changed get_duplicate_key_count to get_key_count_array.
05/31/83 by Matthew Pierret: Added $destroy_index and $destroy_cursor.
05/02/84 by Lee Baldwin:  Renamed $get_count to $get_key_count_by_spec.
10/23/84 by Lindsey L. Spratt:  Addressed auditing comments - alphabetized
            entries, fixed $create_index to use "fixed bin (17)" instead of
            just "fixed bin", added a description section.
