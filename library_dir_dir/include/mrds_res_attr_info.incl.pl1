  1) change(86-05-14,Dupuis), approve(86-08-05,MCR7491), audit(86-08-08,Blair),
     install(86-08-15,MR12.0-1127):
     Created by Al Dupuis to resolve a problem where the "rdbi" segment was
     overflowing. Previously mrds was allocating a "rm_attr_info" structure for
     each attribute in each relation. In certain cases (phx20301, mrds #154)
     with very large databases, this resulted in thousands of structures being
     allocated. This new include keeps track of "rm_attr_info" structures and
     stops duplicates from being allocated, bringing the allocation counts down
     from the thousands to the hundreds.
