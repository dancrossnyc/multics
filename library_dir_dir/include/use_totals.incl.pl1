/* Modified Feb 1980 by M. B. Armstrong to implement multiple rate structures. (UNCA)
   Modified May 1980 by R. McDonald to include printer page charge, replaces  cpu time in iod. (UNCA)
   Modified July 1981 by C. Hornig to eliminate rs_number and master_proj from bin,
   -		split it into sub-structures for convenience in conversion,
   -		and make version a character string.
   Modified August 1981 by T. Casey to put back rs_number in bin.
   Modified 1984-08-31 BIM for half-year billing cycles, which is all
	  that will fit in a segment.
