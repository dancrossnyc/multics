/* This include file describes the user_message passed by a login server to
   a user process when a connection is assigned to, or disconnected from,
   that process. The format of the "connection_info" is dependent on the type
   of connection. The connection_info is not included in disconnect messages.

   The "common" portion of the message is passed separately for "dialed" channels
   so that convert_dial_message_ in the dial-server's process can use it to
   to determine the names of the connectin and the associated I/O module. The
   "full" message is passed in all cases and used when actually doing the
   attachment.
