               hardware problems.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A trailer entry (record  of a process's connection
               to a segment) for  some segment specifies a second
               segment as the descriptor segment for some process
               connected to that segment, but that second segment
               does  not have  certain bits  on in  its AST entry
               which would be on in the AST entry of a descriptor
               segment.   This  indicates  a  logic  error in the

     Meaning:  System   shutdown,  emergency   or  regular,   has
               completed successfully.  The system will return to

               does not return to  bce, or other error condition,
               the storage system will  probably not be affected.
               If such problem arises,  attempt ESD.  The message
               "system  already  shut  down"  will  be printed if
               there is no problem.  When the "shutdown complete"
               message  is  issued,  there  is  no  more  Multics

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (sounds beeper)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  Some disks could not be  shut down due to hardware
               problems.   Messages   have  occurred  identifying
               these drives  and the problems.  All  other drives
               have  been shut  down- their  contents are  not in
               main memory or on the  paging device.  The RPV has
               not been shut down either, so that the system will
               perform some salvaging when it comes up.

     Action:   Attempt to ready those  drives that are not ready.
               When this has been done, retry ESD.  If the drives
               have been made accessible, ESD will succeed with a
               normal  "shutdown  complete"   message.   If  they
               cannot be  made ready, the paging  device (if any)
               is   unflushed.   See   the  description   of  the

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  an attempt  to shut  down the  system, the
               system  could not run  on the bootload  CPU.  This
               problem  may  be  due   to  hardware  or  software
               problems.  The system will attempt to crash, which
               it may not complete.

     Action:   If  the system  does not  complete its  attempt to
               crash, it  should be crashed manually.   It may be
               necessary  to change   the bootload  CPU manually.
               This  can be  done by  putting all  CPUs into STEP
               mode, manually assigning an  interrupt mask to the
               new bootload CPU from the bootload SCU maintenance
               panel,  taking only  the new  bootload CPU  out of
               STEP mode,  and doing an EXECUTE  SWITCHES on that
               CPU.  Once the system has crashed successfully, an
               ESD  should be  attempted.  This  will most likely
               succeed.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  the attempt  to shut  down the  system, an
               unexpected condition has been signalled.  This may
               result from hardware problems, or a logic error in
               the supervisor.  The system crashes and returns to
               BCE, whereupon an ESD should be attempted in order
               to finish  flushing Multics information  from main
               memory.     Because   of    the   difference    in
               implementation between normal shutdown and ESD, it
               is possible  that ESD will not  encounter the same
               problem, and instead be successful.

               system  by a  tree-walk of  threaded ASTEs failed,
               likely due  to inconsistent threading in  the SST.
               The segments will be  deactivated by a linear walk
               of   the  SST.    Quota  inconsistencies   may  be
               introduced by  this.  These can be  corrected by a
               quota salvage of the hierarchy.

     Action:   At a  convenient time, run a quota  salvage of the
               hierarchy.

     Meaning:  An  attempt to  withdraw a  disk address  from the

               finding  a volume  map word  with at  least one of

               software failure.

     Action:   Perform an  ESD.  Reboot the system  and perform a

               detect volume map words with invalid bits enabled,
               so the salvager must be used.  Once the salvage is
               complete,  the volume  may  be  added back  to the

               x25_mpx(CHN):  No buffers available.


     Stream:   Logged in SYSERR log.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  x25_mpx  was unable  to  allocate  a buffer  for a
               protocol  packet.  This  indicates a  severe space
               problem  in tty_buf.   The multiplexer  will sends
               itself a "hangup" order after freeing any space it
               has  for  protocol  packets  in  tty_buf.  If this
               multiplexer is  not the cause of  the problem then
               the system is likely to crash soon.
