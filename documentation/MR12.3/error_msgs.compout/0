     This  document  has  been  prepared  automatically  from the
system source by Multics Software Support.  Every effort has been
made  to supply  documentation for  each and  every message  that
could appear either on the system console, or in the system logs.
However,  some of the  system messages are  not provided in  this
document due  to the messages developed prior  to the development
of  the  error  messages  document,  or  omitted  in  error.  The
following is a list of modules  that are known to be missing from
this document:

bootload_fs_.pl1                 protocol_mpx.pl1

     The message example  is a literal copy of  the message, with
substitutable fields  shown in all capitals.   Each substitutable
field is described in the Meaning paragraph.


_O_u_t_p_u_t

     The output  field describes how the message  is output.  For
hardcore  messages  it  shows  the  interpretation  of  the first
argument to SYSERR, which  determines whether the system crashes,
sounds  the  beeper,  etc.   For  answering  service messages, it
describes the output stream and source.


_T_i_m_e

     The  time section  describes the  time when  the message  is
possible.


_M_e_a_n_i_n_g

     The meaning paragraph describes  the situation that prompted
the  message and the  probable cause of  the situation.  It  then
describes  the  consequences  of  the  situation.   Substitutable
parameters in the message example are explained here.


_A_c_t_i_o_n

     The  action  paragraph  describes  what  operator  action is
required when the message occurs.

               cpus or  mixed systems of  DPS, L68 and  DPS8 cpus
               can  only  have   4  memories  configured.   (i.e.
               Memory tags A, B, C, and D).

     Action:   Correct  the  physical  configuration  and/or  the
               configuration deck and reboot.

               requests; be more specific.


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     In response to an abs run command.

     Meaning:  The  specified arguments  matched either  zero, or
               more than one, request, and so no job was run.

     Action:   Re-enter  the command  with correct  arguments, to
               select exactly one job for running.



               [absentee_utility_.pl1]

               use  "abs  stop  queue  all"  to  halt  all  other
               absentee logins, change the login word to halt all
               interactive logins, and either  wait for a process
               to log out, or bump  one, before repeating the abs
               run command.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system  was  unable   to  cancel  a  resource
               reservation for an absentee  process that is being
               destroyed.     The   resource(s)    might   remain
               unavailable to other users.  There is some problem
               in the resource reservation mechanism.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system  was  unable   to  assign  a  resource
               reservation  to  an  absentee  job  that  is being
               logged in.  The job will be run, but it might fail
               if the resources it needs happen to be unavailable
               when it  requests them.  There is  some problem in
               the resource reservation mechanism.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

               absentee_user_manager_:  Error:  CONDITION


     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An unexpected fault  has occurred while performing
               some  absentee function such  as logging in  a new
               absentee user.  The  system automatically performs
               an Answering Service dump and attempts to recover.

     Action:   No  action   is  required  unless   the  condition
               persists.  If this  message occurs repeatedly, try
               stopping   the  absentee   facility;  inform   the
               programming staff.

     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A storage system error prevented the absentee user
               from logging in.  This is due to some error in the
               process  creating  mechanism.   The  user  is  not
               logged in.

     Action:   Contact the  system programming staff.   Shut down

               WWWWWWWWWWWW


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This message  is similar to the  preceding message
               described above,  except that the signal  does not
               come  from  the  Initializer  but  from some other
               process.  The process ID of the sending process is
               printed  in octal.   The event  message was  not a
               valid  item.  The  system ignores  the signal  and
               goes on.

     Action:   If absentee  jobs will no  longer run, try  an abs
               stop  and   an  abs  start.   Inform   the  system
               programming staff.

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An unrecognizable event  message has been received
               from the Answering Service.   Its value is printed
               in octal.  Usually, the first word is the function
               code  and the  second word   is the  index in  the
               absentee user  table.  This condition is  due to a
               error  in   the  Answering  Service   or  absentee
               programs.  The system ignores  the signal and goes
               on.  The absentee facility may cease to operate.

     Action:   If absentee  jobs will no  longer run, try  an abs
               stop  and   an  abs  start.   Inform   the  system
               programming staff.

               user sending  the wakeup are printed.   The system
               ignores the signal and goes on.

     Action:   No operator action is required.

               RESOURCE


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     In response to an abs run command.

     Meaning:  The  job selected  by  the  abs run  command needs
               RESOURCE, which  is unavailable.  The job  will be
               logged in anyway.

     Action:   If the job is critical, the resource could be made
               available  by force  detaching it  from some other
               process.  This is a drastic action, and should not
               be   taken  without  the   System  Administrator's
               approval.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The internal queue number in absentee_utility_ was
               invalid when trying to  find an absentee to login.
               If  this  occurs,  there   is  a  logic  error  in

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  Status has been received  from a channel which was

               inoperative.  Data in main memory or on the paging
               device  which need  to be  flushed to  the pack on
               DSKX_NN  cannot be  written out.   The data remain
               where they were and ESD may be tried again.

     Action:   If the drive can be  made ready, make it ready and
               try  ESD again.  Do  NOT move packs  before trying
               ESD, unless address plugs  are changed so that the

               this action  is performed, the MPC  must be halted
               and  restarted with a  reset and branch.)   If the
               pack  is not  successfully shut  down, the  system
               will volume salvage it when it is next brought up,

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The FNP has masked the  channel whose name is NAME
               because it  was generating interrupts  faster than
               they could be handled.

     Action:   The interruptions  can be caused by  any number of
               problems.  This can be caused by the dataset leads
               changing too  fast for the FNP  software to handle
               properly; disconnecting or  connecting FNP cables,
               powering  off or  on a  hardwired terminal,  a bad
               modem,  etc.  It  is  also  possible that  the FNP
               channel hardware is defective.  Future attempts to
               use this  channel may possibly crash  the FNP.  CS
               representatives   may  need    to  be   called  to
               investigate.    An   "attach"   command   will  be
               necessary to put the channel back in service.

               from FNP  X.  S is an octal  representation of the
               status   accompanying    the   interrupt.    STATE

     Meaning:  Only N words of free space remain in tty_buf after
               allocating  the  header  and  circular  queue.   A
               minimum  of 256  words is  required and ordinarily
               more free space is  desirable.  Either the size of
               tty_buf,  as  specified  by  the  PARM TTYB config
               card,  must  be  increased  or  the circular queue
               size, as  specified by the PARM  TTYQ config card,
               must be decreased.

     Action:   Correct the config deck and reboot the system.

     Meaning:  At some  time during the use of  volume PVNAME (on
               drive  dskX_NNS), the system  encountered problems
               which  left the  volume in  an inconsistent state.
               The  effect  of  this  is  that  some free records
               and/or free  VTOCEs are unavailable (lost)  to the
               system.  These inconsistencies can be corrected by
               a  volume salvage.   The number  of unused records
               and VTOCEs which are available for use is printed.

     Action:   If the  number of free  records or free  vtoces is
               low, a  physical volume salvage should  be done on
               the volume  prior to mounting it  again to recover

     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     System Intialization.

               hc_ipc:  ITT overflow caused by NAME.PROJ


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  When wakeups are sent from one process to another,
               or from a  device like a tape drive  to a process,
               the   wakeups  are   stored  temporarily   in  the
               Interprocess Transmission Table (ITT).  If wakeups
               are  sent too  fast, or  if the  receiving process
               never calls block to read its wakeups, the ITT may
               overflow.  When  the ITT is full,  this message is
               printed  for   each  lost  wakeup.    The  message
               identifies  the sender of  the wakeup, who  may be
               innocent of any error or wrongdoing.

               If  a  critical  system  function  cannot  send  a
               wakeup, the system may crash.

     Action:   If the ITT overflow is a transient condition, this
               message will stop coming  out after a few minutes.
               If so, system operation  may return to normal.  If
               the message comes out  repeatedly, the system will
               have to be crashed, since user terminal operation,
               daemon  operations,  and  the  message coordinator
               depend   on  wakeups.    Follow  normal   recovery
               procedures.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  When a  process recieves wakeups, they  are copied
               from  the Interprocess   Transmission Table  to an
               Event Channel Table (ECT).  A process owns one ECT
               per  ring.  If,  for any  reason, an  entry for  a
               wakeup cannot be allocated in a process' ECT, that
               process is terminated.

     Action:   If  the process  is a  daemon process,  it must be
               reinitialized.  If the  process is the initializer
               process, the system will crash.

               were mounted at the last shutdown are accepted, or
               when a physical volume is mounted and accepted.

     Meaning:  A VTOC header was  encountered which did not agree
               with the VTOC Map.  This  will occur when a volume
               which was not shut down properly is mounted.

     Meaning:  The   volume  was   not  shut   down  properly  or
               inconsistencies were detected while the volume was
               mounted.  The  effect of these  inconsistencies is
               that free records and free  VTOCEs are lost to the

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This message  is typed out when a  user is bumped.
               A user may be bumped by another member of his load
               control  group, in  which case  REASON is  pr_grp,
               which means group preemption.  If a secondary user
               is bumped by a primary  user, either from the same
               group  or from  another group,  REASON is  pr_sec,
               meaning secondary  user preemption.  If  REASON is
               pr_emrg,  meaning emergency  preemption, a  system
               programmer  was logging  in and  had to  bump some
               user.  A user is usually given three minutes after
               this message to clean up  and log out before being

               No change was made  to the system parameters.  The
               system  continues  operation,  selecting  the last

     Meaning:  Either  some system  table has  been damaged  or a
               system  administrator  was   changing  work  class
               definitions at the time of a shift change, or when

               GRPID but the entry  in the master_group_table for

               the users  in project PROJ  should be in  the load
               control group GRPID,  but the system administrator

     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system administrator  has specified  that the
               load control group GRPID is to have "all the rest"
               of the  primary load units after  all other groups
               have   taken  their  allocations   from  maxunits.
               However,  maxunits is  less  than  the sum  of the
               primary  allocations, giving  the group  GRPID the
               negative  allocation  of  YY  units.   The  system
               proceeds,  attempting to  log the  user in anyway.
               Of  course, the  user is  allowed secondary status
               only if he  is allowed to log in at  all.  This is
               often  the result of  the operator typing  maxu 30
               instead of maxu 300, or some similar error.

     Action:   Check the value of maxunits  and, if a mistake was
               made,  correct  it.   If  the  maxunits  value  is
               correct,  note  this   situation  for  the  system

               more than one group a  "take all the rest" maximum
               primary unit allocation.  The user control package
               cannot  handle this  situation.  The  second group
               with a -1 maxprim is listed.  The system completes
               startup and users can log  in but maxunits may not
               be obeyed.

     Action:   Contact the system administrator.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  No hardcore partitions were  defined on any of the
               packs on  the drives specified by  the ROOT CONFIG
               card.   At  least  the  RPV  must  have a hardcore
               partition.  Supervisor segments cannot be created.

     Action:   If this is a cold  boot, which is most likely, the
               RPV was initialized  without a hardcore partition.
               It  must  be  reinitialized.   Check  the  PART HC
               CONFIG  card, one of  which must describe  the RPV
               during a cold boot, and  reboot.  If this is not a
               cold  boot, the RPV  has been damaged,  and volume
               recovery must be undertaken.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Meaning:  In  attempting  to  allocate  space  for  hardcore
               segment  SEGNAME, no more  room could be  found in
               any of the defined hardcore partitions.

     Action:   If  this is  a  cold  boot, redefine  the hardcore
               partition of the RPV to  be larger.  At least 1000
               (decimal) records is recommended.  Change the PART
               HC  CONFIG  card  describing  the  RPV to indicate
               this,  and reboot.   If this  is not  a cold boot,
               this  situation is  highly unlikely  and indicates
               damage to  one or more RLV  volume labels.  Volume
               recovery  for part  or all  of the  RLV should  be
               undertaken.

     Action:   If this recurs, revert  to a previous system tape.
               No emergency shutdown is needed.

               physical volumes have not  been made known via the
               add_vol command.  If the pack is a non-demountable
               volume, a DRIVE will only be printed if the system
               knows the  drive on which the  pack was previously
               mounted.   If the  pack is  a demountable  volume,
               then  a  DRIVE  will  be  printed  always.  If the
               system does  not know the drive on  which the pack
               was  last mounted, then  it chooses a  drive where
               the  pack  should  be   mounted  and  prints  this
               message.

     Action:   Mount the pack specified.  If it is not convenient
               to use the specified DRIVE, use another.  Then use
               the  add_vol command to  tell the system  that the
               physical volume has been  mounted.  When all packs
               have been mounted and  either accepted via add_vol
               or are  on the drives where the  system called for
               them, issue a "alv  LVNAME" command to accept them
               all at  once.  The logical  volume will be  put in
               use.

               recovers from these errors and continues, possibly
               with the  loss of some input or  output.  If ENAME
               is mc.message, some daemon output may be lost.  If
               ENAME is anything else,  some input to that daemon
               may be  lost, and the operator  should communicate
               with  the  daemon  immediately,  in  case this has
               happened.   This indicates  a logic  error in  the
               supervisor, or CPU or memory hardware problems.

               ANSI  and   LABEL  is  "<label>   (with  non-blank

               is an ANSI label with a non-blank character in the

               site  standards  for   authenticating  such  tapes
               before    doing     the    authentication.     Any

               agree  with  the  actual  memory  available in the
               store  unit.  A possible  example of this  is when
               the lower store is actually  in two store units (A
               and  A1)  and  the  secondary  unit  (A1)  is  not

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  CPU configuration cards imply that Port P on SCU's
               (P  is the port  number, from 0  to 7) is  both an
               expander port (by being named as the CPU port in a
               CPU card with an  expander_port field), and not an
               expander  port (by  being  named  in one  that has
               none).

     Action:   Correct the configuratin deck and reboot.

               Y.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  Either the PORT SIZE plug  on the free edge of the
               PQ board  of the bootload CPU does  not agree with
               the  configuration deck,  or the  actual amount of
               memory present  in MEM Y  does not agree  with the
               config deck.
