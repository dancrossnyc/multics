                           INTRODUCTION




Multics Release  12.3 (MR12.3) is a complete  release and assumes
the prior installation of MR12.2.  That is, the library tapes are
self-supporting and  do not require any other  information to run
Multics.


This  document  includes  descriptions  of  features  included in
Multics Release MR12.3.


A  separate document,  Software Installation  Bulletin (SIB),  is
supplied with the release tapes.   The SIB describes the contents
of the release tapes and  includes procedures for installation of
MR12.3.


Additional  documentation,  including  a  list  of  bugs fixed in
MR12.3, is  provided with the release tapes,  either as printable
segments on the tape (in  a special directory >doc>MR12.3), or as
paper copy.


Following  is a  summary of   the remaining  of sections  in this
document.

                            SECTION 3


                        CONTENTS OF MR12.3






_C_O_M_M_U_N_I_C_A_T_I_O_N_S _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E




_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

 1.   Modified  the system command  to use the  process date_time
      format  rather than the  concatenation of the  process date
      and   time   format   for   all   keywords   starting  with
      date_time_**.

 2.    Added the capability to specify  starnames as input to the
      dsmla command.  The dsmla  command will now display aliases
      associated with the specified name as well as the specified
      name itself.

 3.   Modified   the   listing   of    memos   created   with   a
      -repeat_when_processed  memo control_argument.   The change
      (in   the  flags   description)  is   from  per_process  to
      repeat_when_processed.

 4.   When copying a non-empty  mailbox along with its max_length
      characterisic, the copy would prematurely terminate with an
      error of "The requested action was not performed".  This is
      being  changed   to  allow  the  copy   to  continue.   The
      consequences are that under  this condition, the max_length
      of the target of the  copy will keep the default max_length
      from when it was created,  as opposed to the expected value
      from  the source.   The following  commands and subroutines
      will  be affected  copy, move,  copy_dir, move_dir,  copy_,
      copy_seg_ and copy_dir_.

 5.   Added the gate entry mail_table_priv_$delete_alias_case_ins
      to   permit  case-insensitive    alias  deletions   by  the
      update_mail_table_entry command.


                               3-1                        SRB12.3


 6.   1.  Modified  the display format for  display_volume_log to
      print  at 79  characters per   line.  Also  the ability  to
      display the disk label of the volume presented in the volog
      is  added through  the -label,  -no_label and  -all control
      arguments.

      2.  Modified  display format of display_pvolog  to print in
      columnized output of 79 characters per line.

      3.  Changed the set_volume_log command to allow the setting
      of  the  number  of  consolidated  and  inceremental reload
      groups  through  the   -incr_sets  and  -cons_sets  control
      arguments.

      4.   Enhanced  the  purging  mechanism  to  provide  better
      control over reload groups.

      5.   Removed the  -incr_skip_count argument  for the volume
      dumper commands.  The  new -purge_volume_log (-pvl) control
      argument   is   now   used   instead.    Please   use   the
      set_volume_log  command  to  establish  the  correct reload
      groups for your site.   Please type:  "help set_volume_log"
      for details.


_L_A_N_G_U_A_G_E_S


_C _L_a_n_g_u_a_g_e

A- 1. Modified  the C_compile  command's control  argument -table
      (-tb)  so  it  will  no  longer  cause  the generation of a
      linkage  editor  listing,  use   the  -list  (-ls)  control
      argument  instead.   The  C_compile  command  now finds the
      default C funtime library using standard search rules.

A- 2. Modified the  C runtime system and the  execution family of
      routines to  properly set their return  values.  This value
      contains  information about   nonstandard operation  of the
      child process.


_P_L_/_1

B- 1. Added  the  -version   (default)  and  -no_default  control
      arguments to the PL/1 Compiler.

B- 2. Modified  the PL/1  Compiler to  generate warnings  when an
      options  (constant)  variable  occurs  on  the  LHS  of  an
      assignment statement.





                               3-2                        SRB12.3


B- 3. Modified  the  PL/1  Compiler  to  allow  use  of the named
      constants as replication factors.


_E_M_A_C_S_, _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _1_2_._9

C- 1. 1.   Modified  f  (rmail-forward)  to  forward  the current
      message to an address (list)  that will be prompted for.  A
      numeric   argument   will   allow   the   user   to   enter
      redistribution comments via a comments buffer.

      2.   Modified  x  (rmail-toggle-seen)  to  toggle  the seen
      switch on the current message.  This switch is displayed to
      the  user as the  minor mode "Seen"  and will be  turned on
      immediately a  message is brought into the  RMAIL buffer to
      be displayed.

      3.  Modified  ?  (rmail-help) to display  brief information
      about each  of the RMAIL  mode (additionally the  reply and
      comment buffers) requests that are available.

      4.   Modified  q  (rmail-quit)  is  being  modified to only
      question a  user quitting when no rmail  commands have been
      entered between  the arrival of new mail  and requesting of
      rmail-quit.

C- 2. Modified emacs -line_length NN  control argument so that NN
      will be expected to describe  the useable number of columns
      on the screen.   The value of NN used to  be required to be
      one grater than the screen capability.


_M_O_W_S_E

D- 1. Added the  control order get_event_channel to  mowse_io_ so
      that programs  which require the  use of a  foreground data
      event   channel,  such   as  dial_out,   may  request   the
      identification of the ipc_event channel.

















                               3-3                        SRB12.3


_W_S_T_E_R_M

E- 1.
      1. A new  keyboard input routine  will be added  which will
         allow some  EMACS-like editing capabilities  on keyboard
         input before sending a line to the host.

      2. Input going to and coming  from the host will be trapped
         by  WSTERM to  allow the  data to  be stored  to a  file
         and/or printed as it is being displayed.

      3. Lines of input  will be saved in a  circular buffer each
         time  they are  entered to  allow them  to be  retrieved
         later.


_E_D_I_T_O_R_S

F- 1.
      Modified qedx to allow  whitespaces between the "q" request
      and the NL character.


































                               3-4                        SRB12.3









                            SECTION 4


                       INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES




_O_P_E_R_A_T_I_N_G _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E


_A_L_M _V_e_r_s_i_o_n _6_._4

A- 1. This  version of  the  assembler  contains a  new pseudo-op
      "error",  several  bug  fixes,  and  discontinuation of the
      obsolete "followon" pseudo-op.  It's use will now incur a B
      error.  The  "error" pseudo-op causes the  fatal error flag
      to  be  set  which  results  in  the  "Translation failed."
      message being  issued at the  end of the  assembly.  "-nsb"
      will now be accepted  as an abbreviation for "-no_symbols".
      The  assembler will now  prevent itself from  being invoked
      recursively.


_O_P_E_R_A_T_I_N_G _S_Y_S_T_E_M _S_O_F_T_W_A_R_E


_C_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

B- 1. The  -incr_skip_count   argument  for  the   volume  dumper
      commands  has  been  removed.   The  new  -purge_volume_log
      (-pvl) is now used instead.
