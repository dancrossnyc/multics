               scs_and_clock_init:   SCU  clock  on  port  NUMBER
               MALFUNCTION.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The calendar clock in the bootload SCU seems to be
               malfunctioning, as specified by MALFUNCTION.

     Action:   Fix  the  SCU,  or  configure  another  SCU as low
               order.


               [scs_and_clock_init.pl1]
               scs_and_clock_init:  The zone on  the CLOK card is
               not in time_info_.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The zone  named on the  CLOK card is  not found in
               time_info_,   the    system's   time   information
               database.   The system  cannot run  unless a known
               zone is specified.

     Action:   Update the CLOK card so  that it contains a proper
               zone name.  If  the zone you need is  not known to
               the  system,   time_info_.cds  will  have   to  be
               updated,  a new  system tape  generated, and  then
               booting  from that  tape.  time_info_  contains at
               least 1 name for each  hour around the world.  You
               may  select a  named zone  near the  one you need,

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The cycle port priority on  the SCUs cannot be set
               optimally  because the  range of  port numbers for
               CPUs and IOMs overlap.  The manual settings of the
               cycle port  priority switches on the  SCUs will be
               used instead.  The  system may experience problems
               as  a  result,  with  the  typical  symptom  being
               op-not-complete  faults at   random times  by CPUs
               with   higher  port    numbers  (lower   SCU  port
               priority).

     Action:   Continue  to  operate  the  system  normally,  but
               consult  with  Field  Engineering  personnel.   If
               possible,  the system   should be  reconfigured so
               that the range of port  numbers of IOMs and CPU do
               not   overlap.    Further,   CPU   should   be  on
               higher-numbered ports than IOMs and Bulk Stores.

     Stream:   Logged in SYSERR log.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A  mismatch has  been detected  between the branch
               and  the ASTE  for  a  segment.  The  two segments
               indicated  by  VTOCE  index  and  physical  volume
               location/identifier  claim to  have the  same file
               system  unique identifier.   The operation  either
               proceeds  or returns  a connection  failure to the
               user  process, as   appropriate.  This  message is
               logged for the use of system programmers.

               This  error can  occur  if  damage to  a directory
               branch  has   caused  its  unique  ID   to  become
               incorrect, and if the  incorrect unique ID happens
               to  be identical  to the  unique ID  of a  segment
               already active.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

               seg_fault:  illegal segfault on cpu X


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The SCU data stored  by processor X indicates that
               a segment fault has occurred but the SDW indicated
               by the  SCU data has no  directed fault indicator.
               This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   The  system
               attempts to retry the faulting instruction.

     Action:   Inform  field  engineering   personnel.   If  this
               message persists, attempt to delete the CPU.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An  attempt was  made to  set sst$tfreep  to zero.
               The  supervisor  checks  for  this  situation  and
               crashes here when one entry remains in the trailer
               segment in order to trap an elusive bug which used
               to cause "trailer  storage area exhausted" crashes
               when  the  trailer  segment  was  not  full.  This
               indicates a logic error  in the supervisor, or CPU
               or  memory  hardware   problems.   BOS  Typewriter

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  There  are no more  free entries available  in the
               system  trailer  segment,  str_seg.   This  may be
               indicative of software- or hardware-induced damage
               to the SST  or str_seg, or may be  indicative of a
               number of logged-in processes  which is vastly too
               large.   A  more  likely  cause  is insufficiently
               large  str_seg.  The  size of  the str_seg  can be
               changed by  the TBLS STR card in  the config deck.
               This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU or  memory hardware problems.   BOS Typewriter
               (Crashes system)es

     Action:   Follow  normal  recovery  procedures.   It  may be
               necessary to  increase the size of  the str_seg by
               the TBLS STR card in  the config deck.  Be sure to

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  System   shutdown,  emergency   or  regular,   has
               completed successfully.  The system will return to
               bce.  If  any problem arises such  that the system

               the storage system will  probably not be affected.
               If such problem arises,  attempt ESD.  The message
               "system  already  shut  down"  will  be printed if
               there is no problem.  When the "shutdown complete"

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  Some disks could not be  shut down due to hardware
               problems.   Messages   have  occurred  identifying
               these drives  and the problems.  All  other drives
               have  been shut  down- their  contents are  not in
               main memory or on the  paging device.  The RPV has
               not been shut down either, so that the system will
               perform some salvaging when it comes up.

     Action:   Attempt to ready those  drives that are not ready.
               When this has been done, retry ESD.  If the drives
               have been made accessible, ESD will succeed with a
               normal  "shutdown  complete"   message.   If  they
               cannot be  made ready, the paging  device (if any)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  an attempt  to shut  down the  system, the

               problems.  The system will attempt to crash, which
               it may not complete.

     Action:   If  the system  does not  complete its  attempt to
               crash, it  should be crashed manually.   It may be
               necessary  to change   the bootload  CPU manually.
               This  can be  done by  putting all  CPUs into STEP
               mode, manually assigning an  interrupt mask to the
               new bootload CPU from the bootload SCU maintenance
               panel,  taking only  the new  bootload CPU  out of
               STEP mode,  and doing an EXECUTE  SWITCHES on that
               CPU.  Once the system has crashed successfully, an
               ESD  should be  attempted.  This  will most likely
               succeed.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  the attempt  to shut  down the  system, an
               unexpected condition has been signalled.  This may
               result from hardware problems, or a logic error in
               the supervisor.  The system crashes and returns to
               BCE, whereupon an ESD should be attempted in order
               to finish  flushing Multics information  from main
               memory.     Because   of    the   difference    in
               implementation between normal shutdown and ESD, it
               is possible  that ESD will not  encounter the same
               problem, and instead be successful.

     Meaning:  The attempt to deactivate all segments in the file
               system  by a  tree-walk of  threaded ASTEs failed,
               likely due  to inconsistent threading in  the SST.
               The segments will be  deactivated by a linear walk
               of   the  SST.    Quota  inconsistencies   may  be
               introduced by  this.  These can be  corrected by a

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   A fault has
               occurred while copying data  from the wired syserr
               log buffer to the  paged syserr log.  This usually
               results  from a disk  error on the  LOG partition,
               which  would also   generate disk  error messages.
               The sequence numbers of  the affected messages are
               given because those messages may not appear in the
               LOG partition.

               re-created automatically.

               The  display_log_segment command   can be  used to

               been disconnected  by the FNP.  STATE  is the main
               state of the link.   FUNCTION is the last function
               the link  processed.  The ESTATE is  the execution
               state of the last function.  PSTATE and SSTATE are
               the link up substate.

     Stream:   Logged in SYSERR log.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  FNP has received  a command reject  (LAPB) or
               frame  reject (LAP)  which specified  a reason  of
               "wide frame"  on channel CHN.  The  actual level 2
               command is  FRAME.  This means the  frame received
               by the other end was too long.  Instead of looping
               continuously trying  to send this frame,  the link
               will be  disconnected.  The maximum frame  size in
               the  Multics TTF for  this link should  be checked
               against the size expected by  the other end of the
               link, and corrected.

     Stream:   Logged in SYSERR log.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  x25_mpx  was unable  to  allocate  a buffer  for a
               protocol  packet.  This  indicates a  severe space
               problem  in tty_buf.   The multiplexer  will sends
               itself a "hangup" order after freeing any space it
               has  for  protocol  packets  in  tty_buf.  If this
               multiplexer is  not the cause of  the problem then
               the system is likely to crash soon.
