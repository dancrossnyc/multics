     This  document  has  been  prepared  automatically  from the
system source by Multics Software Support.  Every effort has been
made  to supply  documentation for  each and  every message  that
could appear either on the system console, or in the system logs.
However,  some of the  system messages are  not provided in  this
document due  to the messages developed prior  to the development
of  the  error  messages  document,  or  omitted  in  error.  The
following is a list of modules  that are known to be missing from
this document:

_M_e_s_s_a_g_e _E_x_a_m_p_l_e

     The message example  is a literal copy of  the message, with
substitutable fields  shown in all capitals.   Each substitutable
field is described in the Meaning paragraph.


_O_u_t_p_u_t

     The output  field describes how the message  is output.  For
hardcore  messages  it  shows  the  interpretation  of  the first
argument to SYSERR, which  determines whether the system crashes,
sounds  the  beeper,  etc.   For  answering  service messages, it
describes the output stream and source.


_T_i_m_e

     The  time section  describes the  time when  the message  is
possible.


_M_e_a_n_i_n_g

     The meaning paragraph describes  the situation that prompted
the  message and the  probable cause of  the situation.  It  then
describes  the  consequences  of  the  situation.   Substitutable
parameters in the message example are explained here.


_A_c_t_i_o_n

     The  action  paragraph  describes  what  operator  action is
required when the message occurs.

               deck is  incorrect.  DPS8 CPUs have  only 4 memory
               ports, therefore Multics systems comprised of DPS8
               cpus or  mixed systems of  DPS, L68 and  DPS8 cpus
               can  only  have   4  memories  configured.   (i.e.
               Memory tags A, B, C, and D).

     Action:   Correct  the  physical  configuration  and/or  the
               configuration deck and reboot.

     Meaning:  The system  is too near the upper  limit on logged
               in users to start any absentee jobs.

     Action:   If the immediate running  of the job is essential,
               use  "abs  stop  queue  all"  to  halt  all  other
               absentee logins, change the login word to halt all
               interactive logins, and either  wait for a process
               to log out, or bump  one, before repeating the abs
               run command.

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system  was  unable   to  cancel  a  resource
               reservation for an absentee  process that is being
               destroyed.     The   resource(s)    might   remain
               unavailable to other users.  There is some problem
               in the resource reservation mechanism.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

               absentee_user_manager_:    ERROR   attempting   to
               pre-claim reservation R for USER.PROJ absN


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  system  was  unable   to  assign  a  resource
               reservation  to  an  absentee  job  that  is being
               logged in.  The job will be run, but it might fail
               if the resources it needs happen to be unavailable
               when it  requests them.  There is  some problem in
               the resource reservation mechanism.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

               absentee_user_manager_:  Error:  CONDITION


     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An unexpected fault  has occurred while performing
               some  absentee function such  as logging in  a new
               absentee user.  The  system automatically performs
               an Answering Service dump and attempts to recover.

     Action:   No  action   is  required  unless   the  condition
               persists.  If this  message occurs repeatedly, try
               stopping   the  absentee   facility;  inform   the
               programming staff.

               create absentee event channel


     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The absentee facility could not create part of its
               communications mechanism.  No absentee process can
               be logged in.

     Action:   Try the abs start  command again.  If the absentee
               facility  still  fails,   inform  the  programming
               staff.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A storage system error prevented the absentee user
               from logging in.  This is due to some error in the
               process  creating  mechanism.   The  user  is  not
               logged in.

     Action:   Contact the  system programming staff.   Shut down
               the absentee facility with an  abs bump * * and an

               absentee_user_manager_:  Premature stopstop for ID


     Stream:   as (severity0)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An error has occurred  while trying to destroy the
               absentee  process  ID.   The  system  recovers and
               continues.

     Action:   No operator action is required.

               WWWWWWWWWWWW


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This message  is similar to the  preceding message
               described above,  except that the signal  does not
               come  from  the  Initializer  but  from some other
               process.  The process ID of the sending process is
               printed  in octal.   The event  message was  not a
               valid  item.  The  system ignores  the signal  and
               goes on.

     Action:   If absentee  jobs will no  longer run, try  an abs
               stop  and   an  abs  start.   Inform   the  system
               programming staff.



               [absentee_user_manager_.pl1]

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An unrecognizable event  message has been received
               from the Answering Service.   Its value is printed
               in octal.  Usually, the first word is the function
               code  and the  second word   is the  index in  the
               absentee user  table.  This condition is  due to a
               error  in   the  Answering  Service   or  absentee
               programs.  The system ignores  the signal and goes
               on.  The absentee facility may cease to operate.

     Action:   If absentee  jobs will no  longer run, try  an abs
               stop  and   an  abs  start.   Inform   the  system
               programming staff.

     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This message is similar  to the preceding message,
               except that the name, project, and tty name of the
               user sending  the wakeup are printed.   The system
               ignores the signal and goes on.

     Action:   No operator action is required.

               absentee_user_manager_:  Trace ....


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This is trace output.   It begins coming out about
               every          five         minutes          after
               absentee_user_manager_$aum_trace_on is called.

     Action:   No  operator  action  is  required.   To shut this
               message                 off,                 type:

               RESOURCE


     Stream:   as (severity1)

     Time:     In response to an abs run command.

     Meaning:  The  job selected  by  the  abs run  command needs
               RESOURCE, which  is unavailable.  The job  will be
               logged in anyway.

     Action:   If the job is critical, the resource could be made
               available  by force  detaching it  from some other
               process.  This is a drastic action, and should not
               be   taken  without  the   System  Administrator's
               approval.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The internal queue number in absentee_utility_ was
               invalid when trying to  find an absentee to login.
               If  this  occurs,  there   is  a  logic  error  in
               absentee_utility_.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

     Stream:   as (severity2)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The  absentee facility  keeps a  list of  absentee
               jobs  that   are  either  deferred   or  currently
               running.  This list has a capacity of about 13,000
               entries.  It is extremely  unlikely that this data
               area  will fill  up unless  some user  program has
               entered a loop and is submitting requests for jobs
               faster than the jobs are being run.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.

     Meaning:  The installation_parms table  claims to declare an
               unallowed   number  of   rate  structures.    This
               indicates  that the  table has  been damaged.  The
               system  administrator  must  rectify  the  problem
               using   ed_installation_parms  from   admin  mode,
               before the Answering  Service will initialize.  It
               will  be  necessary  to  re-boot  Multics to retry

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The  copy  of  installation_parms  encountered  by
               system startup claims that RCP resource management
               is disabled.   This disagrees with  information in

     Meaning:  The  version number  stored  in  the SAT  does not
               match  the  expected  version  number,  which is a
               constant in the  Answering Service programs.  This
               may  be because  the  SAT  has been  destroyed, or
               because  an  incorrect  version  of  the Answering
               Service  programs  is   being  used.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Contact  the  system  administrator.   The  System
               Administrator must  either generate a new  SAT, or
               install  the  correct  version  of  the  Answering
               Service.   If  the  System  Administrator  is  not
               available,  enter   admin  mode  and   attempt  to
               retrieve a recent copy of the SAT.  Then exit from

               processes, or  an attempt by an  unauthorized user
               to signal  the daemon user manager.   If the NAME,
               PROJ, and SOURCE cannot be determined, the process
               ID  of  the  sender  is  shown  instead.   The DUT
               (daemon user  table) entry affected is  located at
               YYY|ZZZZ in the Answering Service.

               The  signal is  ignored and  the Answering Service
               attempts to  continue.  If a daemon  user is named
               on the  first line of the message,  this user will
               probably be unable to continue.

     Action:   Contact the system programming staff.  If the user
               named in the message is  a daemon user, try typing
               "logout NAME  PROJ SOURCE", and if  this succeeds,
               log the user in again if necessary.

     Action:   The interruptions  can be caused by  any number of
               problems.  This can be caused by the dataset leads
               changing too  fast for the FNP  software to handle
               properly; disconnecting or  connecting FNP cables,
               powering  off or  on a  hardwired terminal,  a bad
               modem,  etc.  It  is  also  possible that  the FNP
               channel hardware is defective.  Future attempts to
               use this  channel may possibly crash  the FNP.  CS
               representatives   may  need    to  be   called  to
               investigate.    An   "attach"   command   will  be
               necessary to put the channel back in service.

               which  left the  volume in  an inconsistent state.
               The  effect  of  this  is  that  some free records
               and/or free  VTOCEs are unavailable (lost)  to the
               system.  These inconsistencies can be corrected by
               a  volume salvage.   The number  of unused records
               and VTOCEs which are available for use is printed.

     Action:   If the  number of free  records or free  vtoces is

               the   wakeups  are   stored  temporarily   in  the
               Interprocess Transmission Table (ITT).  If wakeups
               are  sent too  fast, or  if the  receiving process
               never calls block to read its wakeups, the ITT may
               overflow.  When  the ITT is full,  this message is
               printed  for   each  lost  wakeup.    The  message
               identifies  the sender of  the wakeup, who  may be

               of the  primary load units after  all other groups
               have   taken  their  allocations   from  maxunits.
               However,  maxunits is  less  than  the sum  of the
               primary  allocations, giving  the group  GRPID the
               negative  allocation  of  YY  units.   The  system
               proceeds,  attempting to  log the  user in anyway.
               Of  course, the  user is  allowed secondary status
               only if he  is allowed to log in at  all.  This is
               often  the result of  the operator typing  maxu 30

     Action:   Check the value of maxunits  and, if a mistake was

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  No hardcore partitions were  defined on any of the
               packs on  the drives specified by  the ROOT CONFIG
               card.   At  least  the  RPV  must  have a hardcore
               partition.  Supervisor segments cannot be created.

     Action:   If this is a cold  boot, which is most likely, the
               RPV was initialized  without a hardcore partition.
               It  must  be  reinitialized.   Check  the  PART HC
               CONFIG  card, one of  which must describe  the RPV
               during a cold boot, and  reboot.  If this is not a
               cold  boot, the RPV  has been damaged,  and volume
               recovery must be undertaken.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Meaning:  In  attempting  to  allocate  space  for  hardcore
               segment  SEGNAME, no more  room could be  found in
               any of the defined hardcore partitions.

     Action:   If  this is  a  cold  boot, redefine  the hardcore
               partition of the RPV to  be larger.  At least 1000
               (decimal) records is recommended.  Change the PART
               HC  CONFIG  card  describing  the  RPV to indicate
               this,  and reboot.   If this  is not  a cold boot,
               this  situation is  highly unlikely  and indicates
               damage to  one or more RLV  volume labels.  Volume
               recovery  for part  or all  of the  RLV should  be
               undertaken.

     Stream:   Initializer process output.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This message occurs when  the system is attempting
               to mount  a logical volume  and finds one  or more
               physical volumes have not  been made known via the
               add_vol command.  If the pack is a non-demountable
               volume, a DRIVE will only be printed if the system
               knows the  drive on which the  pack was previously
               mounted.   If the  pack is  a demountable  volume,
               then  a  DRIVE  will  be  printed  always.  If the
               system does  not know the drive on  which the pack
               was  last mounted, then  it chooses a  drive where
               the  pack  should  be   mounted  and  prints  this

               have been mounted and  either accepted via add_vol
               or are  on the drives where the  system called for
               them, issue a "alv  LVNAME" command to accept them
               all at  once.  The logical  volume will be  put in

               with the  loss of some input or  output.  If ENAME
               is mc.message, some daemon output may be lost.  If
               ENAME is anything else,  some input to that daemon
               may be  lost, and the operator  should communicate
               with  the  daemon  immediately,  in  case this has
               happened.   This indicates  a logic  error in  the

     Meaning:  In attempting to deposit  address XXXXXX on device
               dskX_NN{s},  an  invalid  volume  map  offset  was
               computed.

               ANSI  and   LABEL  is  "<label>   (with  non-blank

               scs_and_clock_init:  The zone on  the CLOK card is
               not in time_info_.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The zone  named on the  CLOK card is  not found in
               time_info_,   the    system's   time   information
               database.   The system  cannot run  unless a known
               zone is specified.

     Action:   Update the CLOK card so  that it contains a proper
               zone name.  If  the zone you need is  not known to
               the  system,   time_info_.cds  will  have   to  be
               updated,  a new  system tape  generated, and  then
               booting  from that  tape.  time_info_  contains at
               least 1 name for each  hour around the world.  You
               may  select a  named zone  near the  one you need,
               just  to get the  system up to  be able to  change
               time_info_.

               scs_init:   CPU/IOM  port  range  overlap.   Using
               manual settings for cycle port priority.


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  The cycle port priority on  the SCUs cannot be set
               optimally  because the  range of  port numbers for
               CPUs and IOMs overlap.  The manual settings of the
               cycle port  priority switches on the  SCUs will be
               used instead.  The  system may experience problems
               as  a  result,  with  the  typical  symptom  being
               op-not-complete  faults at   random times  by CPUs
               with   higher  port    numbers  (lower   SCU  port
               priority).

     Action:   Continue  to  operate  the  system  normally,  but
               consult  with  Field  Engineering  personnel.   If
               possible,  the system   should be  reconfigured so
               that the range of port  numbers of IOMs and CPU do
               not   overlap.    Further,   CPU   should   be  on
               higher-numbered ports than IOMs and Bulk Stores.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  A  mismatch has  been detected  between the branch

               indicated  by  VTOCE  index  and  physical  volume

               logged for the use of system programmers.

               This  error can  occur  if  damage to  a directory
               branch  has   caused  its  unique  ID   to  become
               incorrect, and if the  incorrect unique ID happens
               to  be identical  to the  unique ID  of a  segment
               already active.

               seg_fault:  illegal segfault on cpu X


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  The SCU data stored  by processor X indicates that
               a segment fault has occurred but the SDW indicated
               by the  SCU data has no  directed fault indicator.
               This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   The  system
               attempts to retry the faulting instruction.

     Action:   Inform  field  engineering   personnel.   If  this
               message persists, attempt to delete the CPU.

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  An  attempt was  made to  set sst$tfreep  to zero.
               The  supervisor  checks  for  this  situation  and
               crashes here when one entry remains in the trailer
               segment in order to trap an elusive bug which used
               to cause "trailer  storage area exhausted" crashes
               when  the  trailer  segment  was  not  full.  This
               indicates a logic error  in the supervisor, or CPU
               or memory  hardware problems.  This  error crashes
               the system.

     Action:   Follow normal recovery procedures.  Be sure to get
               a dump.

               seg_fault:  trailer storage area exhausted


     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  There  are no more  free entries available  in the
               system  trailer  segment,  str_seg.   This  may be
               indicative of software- or hardware-induced damage
               to the SST  or str_seg, or may be  indicative of a
               number of logged-in processes  which is vastly too
               large.   A  more  likely  cause  is insufficiently
               large  str_seg.  The  size of  the str_seg  can be
               changed by  the TBLS STR card in  the config deck.
               This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   This  error
               crashes the system.

     Action:   Follow  normal  recovery  procedures.   It  may be
               necessary to  increase the size of  the str_seg by
               the TBLS STR card in  the config deck.  Be sure to
               get a dump.
