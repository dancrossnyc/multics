     The project directory is the "directory" that contains the "home
directories" of everyone who works on your project.  If you work in Marketing,
your project might be named Mktg on the computer.  In terms of directory
hierarchy, the project directory you work under is directly above your home
directory.  It would appear as follows in a path of directories:

project_directory>home_directory>sub_directory

     To find out the name of the project you're working on, go to command
level by pressing the function key F2.  Once you're there, type the print_wdir
command.  It will print a line of directories such as one of the following:

>user_dir_dir>Pubs>Smith    

or

>user_dir_dir>Mktg>Jones>survey

The project directory is the second one from the left.
