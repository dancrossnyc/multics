     You are now in the Multics Tutorial.  Above is a menu whose choices
(usually called menu options) provide information that will enable you to
understand and operate the Multics system.  To select a menu option, type the
number on your keyboard associated with that option.  In the menu above, the
first three options provide an explanation of the topic named and the last
seven produce new menus, from which you can choose explanations of the topics
listed.

     The options in the menu above are arranged in the sequence in which the
subjects are likely to be relevant to you as you begin using Multics.  To get
the most out of the Tutorial, you should read the explanations in the first
three options before proceeding.  Then you may go through the options in the
sequence listed above, or you may wish to choose another order.  Or you may
want to learn about one or two subjects now and come back another time to
learn about the others.
