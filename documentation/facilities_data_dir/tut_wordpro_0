     Wordprocessing is the process of preparing and producing letters,
reports, and other documents.  It can also include, as it does in Multics, the
compilation of records that can be reproduced in various forms in documents.
On Multics, the list processing facilities enable you to assemble information
in records and then rearrange and even reconstruct the records when they are
included in documents such as letters and reports.

     The first step in wordprocessing is creating a "segment" that contains
the information you wish to appear in the final document.  This is done with
one of the Multics "text editors," and the process is made easier by
speedtyping, a facility which lets you devise a typing shorthand.  When
creating a segment, you also specify how the finished product is to be
formatted.  Then you can use a dictionary to search out spelling mistakes and
to hyphenate words at the end of lines.  When the document is fully prepared,
it can be produced in a final, usually printed, form with one or two easy
commands.
