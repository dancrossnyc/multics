     Qedx is a line editor designed to work on both video display terminals
and terminals that print on paper.  Qedx has two modes of operation--input
mode and edit mode.  When you are creating text, you use input mode.  To edit
text, you use edit mode.  As a line editor, it edits text line by line.  To
make additions, erasures, and changes, you specify a line number and use
"requests" to tell the editor what it is to do with the specified line.

     To illustrate this, let's look at a series of requests that change a
sentence in the segment named my_seg:
.fif

r my_seg
5p
Our meeting will not take place.
s/will/did/p
Our meeting did not take place.
.fin

The r request reads my_seg into the editor but does not automatically print
it, as Emacs does.  The request 5p specifies line 5 to be worked on and prints
it.  The s request specifies that the word 'will' is to be taken out and the
word 'did' put in its place, and the request 'p' again prints the new line.

     Qedx also has a macro facility that enables you to combine a number of
requests and execute them all at once and save them for later use.  In
addition, Qedx lets you work on several segments at the same time.  It does
this by keeping segments in separate buffers that you move between by
issuing requests.  This is handy for moving text around, comparing different
segments, and inserting text from one segment into another.

     To learn the details of editing with Qedx, see the qedx Text Editor
Users' Guide (Order No. CG40).
