     The Emacs text editor is designed specifically for video display
terminals.  It automatically displays as much of a "segment" as will fit on the
screen and enables you to move the "cursor" to any point in the text.  At the
location of the cursor you can add, erase, and change text much as you do when
writing and erasing on paper.  You see the effects of your editing as you
type.

     The functions of editing are directed by "requests" that you execute by
using the ESCAPE and the CONTROL keys.  Almost all of the requests are made
with one or the other or both of these two keys.  The requests themselves are
not displayed on the screen, though.  In addition, Emacs has a macro facility
that enables you to combine a number of requests and execute them all at once.
Macros can also be saved.

     Emacs also lets you work on several segments at the same time.  It does
this by keeping segments in separate buffers that you move between by
issuing requests.  This is handy for comparing different segments and
inserting text from one segment into another.

to Emacs Text Editor (Order No. CP31) and Emacs Editor Users' Guide (CH27).
