     In the explanations of topics, there are a number of words surrounded by
quotation marks.  The quoting indicates that the word is in the Tutorial's
glossary, so if you are uncertain of the term's meaning, you can look it up.
To do this, press the function key F1 when the "cursor" is in the menu portion
of the terminal screen.  If your keyboard does not have function keys, use the
ESC key followed by the letter g.  Then, at the bottom of the terminal
screen, you will be asked to type in the term you want defined.  When you've
finished typing the term in, press the RETURN key and the definition will
appear at the bottom of your screen.  When the definition has finished
printing, the cursor will be moved back to the menu portion of the screen.
