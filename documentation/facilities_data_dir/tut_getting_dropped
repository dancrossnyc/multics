     From time to time you may find that you are dropped from the computer
even though you haven't chosen to "log out." There are three reasons why this
happens: the computer fails; you are preempted; you remain inactive for too
long.

     There are two ways in which the computer fails: there are problems with
Multics itself; there are problems with the communications channel.  When the
former occurs, the message MULTICS NOT IN OPERATION is usually printed.  Then
you must wait until Multics is back in operation and log in again.  When the
latter occurs, you may simply be interrupted with the message that normally
prompts you to make the connection.  In this case, you can log in as usual and
pick up where you were interrupted.

     On occasion you may be preempted because there are too many users on
Multics.  In this case, you will be notified in advance.  You can either log
out or be logged out automatically.

     When you remain inactive for a while, 25 minutes or so, you will also be
told that you will be logged out in a few minutes.  If you become active, the
automatic log out will be cancelled.  Otherwise, you will be logged out
automatically.
