     In order to produce a letter, report, or other document, you must first
create a "segment" that contains the information that will be in the final
product.  This is done with one of the Multics "text editors."  The Emacs,
Qedx, and Ted editors are presented in the Writing Text menu of this tutorial.

     The text editors set up a special environment in which you type just as
you would type a letter on a typewriter.  Then you give a name to what's been
typed and store it as is in a segment.  The editors, of course, also enable
you to change and correct what you've typed, both at the time you type it and
any time later.
