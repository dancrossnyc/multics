     Multics enables you to specify operations to be performed automatically
everytime you "log in," operations such as checking your mail and reading the
Multics message of the day.  These tasks are performed by your start_up.ec.
The suffix .ec stands for exec_com, which is a facility on Multics for
executing "commands" as a group.  To have this group of commands executed, you
must name the "segment" they are in start_up.ec, and you must place that
segment in your "home directory."

     Commands that many users include in their start_ups are:
.fif

abbrev -- so that you can use your personal "abbreviations" during each
          terminal session 
print_motd -- so that Multics prints the message of the day when you haven't
              seen it before
read_mail -- so that you are informed immediately how much mail you have
accept_messages -- so that you receive messages from other users while online
.fin

     If you want to log in without executing the commands in your start_up.ec,
you can use the -no_start_up "control argument" with the login command.

     To learn the details of constructing a start_up.ec, see Section 6 of the
New Users' Introduction to Multics, Part II (Order No. CH25).
