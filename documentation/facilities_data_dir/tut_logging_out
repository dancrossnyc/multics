     When you finish your work on Multics, you log out, that is, get off the
computer, by typing the logout "command" after a "ready message." Multics
responds by printing a banner that includes your "user identification," the
date and time that you log out, and your total system resource usage.  The
communication system then prints a message that indicates it is ready to make
another connection, or, if you are using a telephone connection, it tells you
to hang up the phone.  If you are finished using the terminal, you should then
turn it off.

     If someone else is going to use the terminal to log into Multics as soon
as you are finished, you can save the communication channel for them by using
the -hold control argument with the logout command.  That will cause the
"login" banner to be printed as soon as you are logged out.
