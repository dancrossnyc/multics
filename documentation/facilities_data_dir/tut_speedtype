     Speedtype is a form of shorthand you can use when you are creating a
"segment."  It enables you to type the text faster, and it usually improves
accuracy because you can abbreviate words that you commonly mistype.

     The abbreviations used for speedtyping are stored in a symbols
dictionary.  Such dictionaries are created with the use_symbols and
add_symbols commands.  The first establishes a named segment to hold the
symbols, and the second adds symbols to that segment.  Once you invoke the
use_symbols command with the name of a dictionary, all the speedtype commands
automatically refer to that symbols dictionary until you invoke use_symbols
with another dictionary's name.  For example: 

use_symbols my.symbols

add_symbols e the

The add_symbols command adds the abbreviation 'e' for 'the' to the dictionary
named 'my.symbols.'  All symbol dictionaries must have the suffix '.symbols'.

     Once you've created a segment using speedtyping symbols, you can expand
those symbols with the expand_symbols command.  Once again, this command will
use the dictionary most recently named by the use_symbols command.  For
example, if you used symbols from the my.symbols dictionary in
'letter_seg.fdocin', they would be expanded when you issued the command line:

expand_symbols letter_seg.fdocin

     There are also commands for listing, finding, changing, and deleting
symbols.  See the Guide to Multics WORDPRO For New Users (Order No. DJ18) or
