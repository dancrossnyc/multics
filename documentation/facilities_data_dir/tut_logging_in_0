     Whether you've done it yourself or not, you are already logged into
Multics.  Logging in means getting on the computer.  In its basic form, it
is a very simple operation, as is logging out or getting off the computer.

     Logging in also involves getting started, and you can arrange to have
certain operations performed for you automatically as you log in. 

     There are also occasions when you are dropped from the computer before
you log out.  Several different conditions may cause this, and there are
actions you can take to correct such situations when they arise.
