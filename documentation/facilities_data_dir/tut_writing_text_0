     Information on Multics is stored in segments.  The various kinds of text
that comprise information on Multics are placed in segments in several ways.
By far the most common way is to enter text by way of a text editor.  Multics
has a number of editors; the three most commonly used are listed in the menu
above.

     An editor is a special environment in which you can write new text and
edit existing text.  An editor is invoked simply by typing its name as a
"command."  Some editor commands, of which emacs is one, accept "pathname"
"arguments" that enable you to select a segment for editing at the time you
invoke the editor.  For example, the command line:

emacs my_segment

will set up the emacs editor and display the segment named my_segment for
you to work on.  With the Qedx and Ted editors, you have to wait until the
editor is invoked to select a segment.  When you intend to create a new
segment, you just start typing once the editor is in place; you name the
segment when it is time to store it.
