     Ted is a more extensive version of the Qedx text editor.  Like any
editor, Ted provides means for creating and editing text, but in addition, it
enables you to write "macros" that are more powerful than those in Qedx
because they have at their disposal all the functions generally available in
programming languages.  

     Ted is also a line editor like Qedx; it edits text line by line.  To
edit text, you specify line numbers and issue "requests" much as you do in
Qedx, except that the symbols for requests are somewhat different.  Ted also
uses buffers that enable you to keep more than one segment of text in the
editor at the same time.

     To learn the details of editing with Ted, see the Multics Text Editor
(TED) Reference Manual (Order No. CP50).
