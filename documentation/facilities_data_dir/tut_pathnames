     Pathnames are the names that indicate where certain information is stored
in the computer.  In Multics, information is stored in "segments," and
segments are stored in "directories," like folders filed in a file drawer.
Many "commands" are designed to act on segments, so you must tell the command
where to find the segment you want it to act on.  This is done by giving the
command a "pathname" "argument."
