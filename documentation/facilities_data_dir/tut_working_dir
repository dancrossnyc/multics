     The working directory is the "directory" you are working in at any
particular time.  It may be one of your personal directories or any directory
in the Multics system that you can go to.  When you first get on the computer
and are in your "home directory," that is your working directory.

     To refer to "segments" in your working directory, you need give only the
name of the segment.  When you wish to refer to segments in some other
directory, you must specify the path of directories between the working
directory and that segment.  For example, if you are working in directory_1
and want to print a segment that is located two directories from there, you
would type:

print directory_2>directory_3>segment

     To find out which directory you are working in, you use the print_wdir
"command."  It will print a line of directories; your working directory is the
one at the right hand end.  To find out what segments the directory contains,
simply type the list command without arguments.  You also use the list command
to find out which directories are immediately under the working directory.  To
do that, you type:

list -directories

     To try out these commands on the directory you're working in now, go to
"command level" by pressing the function key F2.
