     Subroutines are programming tools used within "programs".  While
"commands" are invoked from "command level," subroutines are invoked from
within programs.  If you have occasion to use subroutines, you can get
descriptions of them by using the help command.  Just type the name of the
subroutine with the help command.  For example:

help menu_

To get a particular entry point in a subroutine, type the name of that
specific entry point with the help command.  For example, by typing

help menu_$display

you automatically bypass the 4 menu_ entry points described in alphabetical
order before this one.

     You can practice getting help with subroutines right now by pressing the
function key F2.  That will put you at command level, where you can use the
help command to find out about some of the subroutines you may want to know
about, such as menu_.
