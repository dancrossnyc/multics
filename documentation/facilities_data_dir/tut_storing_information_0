     One of the chief characteristics of computers is that they store
information electronically.  And Multics can store a lot of information.  In
order to keep track of the information, it is necessary to have a file system.
The basic component of Multics' file system is the segment (often called a
file on other computer systems).  Segments contain stored information such
as text and records.  Segments are then contained in directories, which are
arranged in a hierarchy.
