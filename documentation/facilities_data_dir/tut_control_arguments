     A control argument specifies some variation in the way a "command"
normally performs its function.  For example, when the -directory control
argument is given to the list command:

list -directory

instead of listing "segments" as it usually does, the command lists
"directories." The hyphen before the word directory indicates that it is a
control argument.  All control arguments are preceded by a hyphen.
Ordinarily, control arguments do not have to be typed in any specific order.

     Control arguments themselves sometimes take "arguments."  For example, the
enter_output_request command, which causes a specified segment to be printed
on paper, accepts several control arguments that require arguments of their
own.  When you want more than one copy of a printout, you type:

enter_output_request my_segment -copy 3

The argument to the -copy control argument is necessary to tell the command
how many copies to print.  Without that argument, the command will print only
one copy.  Arguments to a control argument are separated from it by one or
more blank spaces.
