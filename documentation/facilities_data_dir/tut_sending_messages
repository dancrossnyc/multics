     Messages are sent with the send_message "command" (sm for short).  The
entire message is placed on one command line; by typing a carriage return at
the end, you send the message to its intended recipient.

     To send a message, you must know the recipient's "user identification"
(e.g., Smith.Marketing).  This identification is placed right after the
command itself, and this is followed by the message.  For example:

sm Smith.Marketing Did you hear about the meeting today?

     Instead of sending the message directly to the recipient, you can send it
to one of his or her mailboxes.  To do this, you use the -pathname "control
argument" in place of the user identification and give the "pathname" of the
mailbox as an "argument" to the control argument.  For example:

sm -pathname >udd>Marketing>Smith>Smith Did you hear about the meeting today?

This would send the message to Smith's regular mailbox.

     If you want to send the message to more than one recipient, you must
enclose the names in parentheses, as in the following example:

sm (Smith.Marketing Jones.Pubs) Don't forget the meeting.
