     "Commands" are the basic means Multics provides you for telling it what
to do.  To get an explanation of exactly what a particular command does and
how to use it, type the help command followed by the name of the command you
want to learn about.  For example, to find out about the print command, type:

help print

     You can practice this right now by pressing the function key F2.  That
will put you at "command level", where you can use the help command to find
out about some of the commands you have heard about, such as the print
command.
