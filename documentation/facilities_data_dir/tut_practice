     At many places in the Tutorial, it will be appropriate for you to
practice what you are learning.  To do this, wait until the "cursor" has
returned to the menu portion of the terminal screen and then press function
key F2.  If your keyboard doesn't have function keys, use the ESC key followed
by the letter c.  This will take you out of the Tutorial temporarily and put
you at "command level," where you can carry out the instructions you've been
given.

     Command level is indicated by a "ready message," which in this case will
look like this:

r 18:29 24.722 821 level 2

The cursor will be positioned one or two lines beneath the ready message for
you to begin practicing.  When you are finished practicing and ready to
reenter the Tutorial, type the letters pi immediately below a ready message
and then press RETURN.
