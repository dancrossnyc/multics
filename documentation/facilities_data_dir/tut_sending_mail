     Mail is written and sent with the send_mail "command," a powerful command
which gives you many options for editing, sending, and saving mail.  The
send_mail command works interactively, that is, instead of taking all
information from you on the command line, it prompts you for more information
and direction as you go.

     When sending mail, you can use either the recipient's name (e.g., Smith
or Jack Smith) or "user identification" (e.g., Smith.Marketing).  This name or
identification can be provided on the "command line" after the command, or it
can be provided interactively after the command has been invoked.

     When you are asked for input by the prompt 'send_mail:', there are a
number of "requests" you can issue to perform specific actions.  The best way
to understand this is to see it in action.  Go to command level by pressing
the function key F2.  Then type the send_mail command.  You will be asked to
provide a subject and to type the message.  Type any message you wish, and
when you are finished, type \fq and a carriage return at the beginning of a
new line.  To get a list of requests, type a question mark (?) in response to
the 'send_mail:' prompt.  When you are finished, use the send request to end
the message to yourself.  Whenever you are ready to return to the Tutorial,
leave send_mail by typing the quit request in response to a prompt and then
type pi when you've returned to command level.
