     Once a "command" has been invoked, you can interrupt its operation by
pressing the BREAK key.  After the command has stopped, Multics returns to
"command level."  But this is command level 2.

     While you are at this level, you can resume operation of the command by
issuing the start command.  You can also use the
program_interrupt (pi for short) command when you interrupt operation of certain
editors, like emacs, qedx, and ted, or programs that interact with you by
asking you to supply information as you go.  If by chance you use
program_interrupt with a command that cannot be restarted by it, a message to
that effect will be printed.

     This command, unlike start, accomplishes what you probably want when you
press BREAK: it aborts the most recent action and returns to the previous
level.

     If you do not wish to restart the command you interrupted, you should
issue the release command before issuing any other commands.  That will
return you to level 1, the regular command level.
