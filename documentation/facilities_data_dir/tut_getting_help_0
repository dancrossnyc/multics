     There are several ways to get help when you are working on Multics.  This
tutorial is the first way; it provides the most basic information.  The most
common way of getting help is by using the help "command."  To use the help
command, you must be at "command level."

     If you type the help command by itself, you will get a basic explanation
of how to use the command.  To get some specific form of help, such as with a
topic or command, follow the help command with the name of the command, topic,
etc.  For example:

help list

This will get you an explanation of the list command.
