    More than one "command" and its "arguments" may be placed on a single
"command line." To do this, place a semicolon (;) between the separate command
invocations.  For example:

add_name my_segment my_seg; print my_seg

Here the add_name command adds the name my_seg to the segment named
my_segment.  Then the print command is given this second name when it is
invoked to print the segment.

     No spacing is required between the last argument of one command, the
semicolon, and the name of the next command, but if spaces do appear, it makes
no difference.

     There is no limit to the number of commands you can put on a command line.
In fact, if your command line exceeds the width of your terminal screen, it
will be continued automatically on the next line.  Remember, only a carriage
return ends a command line.
