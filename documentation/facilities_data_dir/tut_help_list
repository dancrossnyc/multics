     If you want to find out the precise name of a topic, "command", or
"subroutine" in order to get help with it, you can use the list_help command.
After the command name, type a word that describes what you are looking
for.  For example, if you want to know how to use the mail facilities, you
might type:

list_help mail

(Instead of typing the full name list_help, you can use the short name lh.)

     The list_help command produces a list of exact names used to get help.
The list will include all names in the help system that contain the word you
supplied with the list_help command.  You pick those that are of particular
interest to you and use them with the help command to get the information you
need.

     You can try out the list_help command now.  First, go to "command level"
by pressing the function key F2.  Then type the command along with another
word.  Try "lh mail" and see what you get.
