     Helpful explanations are available for many of the subjects and concepts
relating to Multics.  To get one of these explanations, type the help
"command" followed by the name of the topic you wish to learn about when you
are at "command level".  For example:

help entryname

     If the topic name has more than one word in it, the words should be
separated by underscores rather than blanks.  For example:

help working_directory

     If the name you use for a topic doesn't produce an explanation as you
expect, try a different name for the topic.  Multics may know it by a slightly
different name, such as its singular form rather than its plural, or vice
versa.

     To practice seeking help with a topic, press the function key F2.  That
will put you at command level, where you can issue the help command.  Try it.
