     A command line is a line containing a "command" and any "arguments" that
go with the command, each separated by one or more blank spaces.  It is always
concluded by a carriage return.  For example:

list my_segment -name

is a command line.  It invokes the list command to list the "pathname"
my_segment.  It uses the "control argument" -name to specify that only the
names assigned to my_segment are to be listed and none of the other
information that is normally listed.

     When a command takes several arguments, the order in which the arguments
are typed is often significant.  Normally, pathname arguments follow
immediately after the command name and control arguments follow them.  But
there are exceptions. Then there are commands that accept more than one
pathname, and the order in which they appear is usually significant.  There
are also other types of arguments that may appear on a command line, and these
must be placed properly.  For these reasons it is wise to check the command
description when you are uncertain about the order of arguments for a command.

     A command line may consist of more than one command.  See the Multiple
Commands option in this menu.
