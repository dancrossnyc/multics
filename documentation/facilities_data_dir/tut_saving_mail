     Both the send_mail and read_mail "commands" enable you to file mail away
for future reference.  The send_mail command enables you to save mail you are
sending to others, and read_mail enables you to save mail you've received.

     You save mail by using "requests" once you've started interacting with
the command, and both commands use the same requests for saving mail.  For
instance, whether you're dealing with mail you've written or received, the
copy request puts a copy of it in another mailbox, as in the following
example:

read_mail: copy 2 high_priority

The 2 refers to the number assigned to the piece of mail.

     The read_mail command automatically reads from your regular mailbox
unless you specify another mailbox by way of an "argument" to the command.  For
example:

read_mail high_priority

This, of course, is what you must do to read from one of the mailboxes you are
using to save mail.  You can also go to another mailbox from within read_mail
by using the execute request.  This request, whose short name is the letter e,
treats the rest of the line like a command.  So, if in response to a "prompt"
you type:

read_mail: e read_mail high_priority

you will go into the mailbox named high_priority.

     Below are listed some of the requests (with their short names) that
enable you to save mail:

copy (cp)  copies mail into another mailbox.

save (sv)  copies mail into a save mailbox (one with .sv.mbx suffixes).

forward (fwd)  sends mail to another user's mailbox (available only in
               read_mail).

write (w)  creates a segment and copies mail into it.

append  copies mail to the end of an existing segment.
