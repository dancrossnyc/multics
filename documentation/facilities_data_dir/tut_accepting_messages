     In order to have messages printed as soon as they are sent to you, you
must be accepting messages.  Otherwise, the messages are saved until you
explicitly request that they be printed.  You arrange to have messages printed
on your terminal as they are sent by issuing the accept_messages "command." If
you prefer that they not be printed as they arrive, you issue the
defer_messages command.  Each of these commands remains in effect until the
other one is issued.

     If the accept_messages command is in effect, messages will appear on your
screen as follows:

From Smith.Marketing 11/16/82 1730.2 est Tue: I'll be there.

The message may wipe out something you've already typed, like a "command line,"
but actually the original lines are still there and you can proceed
accordingly.

     When defer_messages has been in effect and you wish to read messages that
may have come, you can use either the accept_messages or the print_messages
command.  If the former, you use the -print "control argument."  For example:

accept_messages -print

Of course, this also puts accept_messages into effect.  With the
print_messages command, you have much greater control over which messages are
printed and what part of them is printed.  For example:

print_messages -last

prints only the latest message received.
