10/20/86 copy_list, cpls

Syntax as a command:  cpls path1 path2 {-control_args}


Function:  creates a new list segment from an existing list segment.


Arguments:
path1
   is the pathname of the existing lister file.  The suffix lister must
   be the last component of the list segment name; however, if path1
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.
path2
   is the pathname of the new list segment.  The suffix lister must be
   the last component of the list segment name; however, if path2 does
   not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppresses error message when no records are selected.
-select STR, -sel STR
   copies records specified by STR (the STR argument must be enclosed
   in quotes).  If this control argument is not specified, then all
   records are copied.
-totals, -tt
   displays the number of records copied.


Notes:  The copy_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the copy was not performed or the invocation
of copy_list terminated abnormally.  A severity of 1 is set when the
copy was done but no records are copied, i.e., the input file had no
records or the selection expression found no match.  A severity of 0 is
set when the copy was done and at least one record was copied.
