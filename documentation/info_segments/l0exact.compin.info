Syntax:  .ifi l0exact "section-title"


Function:
This compose macro performs part of the functions of l0h.  It
1) initializes a new section of the manual
2) generates a section heading on a new page without translating the
   section-title into the Level 0 font
3) does NOT generate an entry in the Table of Contents

It is used when a section-title contains a literal string which must be
kept 'as is'.  It should be inserted at the beginning of a section of
the document.


Arguments:
'section-title' is the title of the section, exactly as it is to appear
   in the section heading.


Notes:
Use the l0toc macro to put the section title in the Table of Contents.


Examples:
A section on the exec_com control language could begin with
        .ifi init
        .srv section 1
        .ifi l0exact "THE exec_com CONTROL LANGUAGE"
        .ifi l0toc "The exec_com Control Language"

which yields (in typed output)

			 SECTION 1

		 THE exec_com CONTROL LANGUAGE

(END)
