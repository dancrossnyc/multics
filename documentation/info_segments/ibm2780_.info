03/31/83  ibm2780_


Function: The ibm2780_ I/O module performs stream I/O to a remote I/O
terminal that has the characteristics of an IBM 2780 data transmission
terminal.

Entry points in this module are not called directly by users; rather,
the module is accessed through the I/O system.

This module in turn constructs an attach description for the module
specified in the -comm control argument, passing the attach information
for ascii or ebcdic, tty, transparent or nontransparent, and all other
attach information specified by the caller.


Syntax and Attach Description:
   ibm2780_ -control_args


Control arguments:
   The following control arguments are optional, with the exception of
-comm and -tty:
-ascii
   transmits control information and data in ASCII.
-carriage_ctl STR
   the eight-character string STR, taken two characters at a time, sets
   the four carriage control characters that specify the advance of 0,
   1, 2, and 3 lines.  The default set of characters is ESCM, ESC/,
   ESCS, and ESCT, where the mnemonic ESC means the ASCII escape
   character.
-comm STR
   uses the communications I/O module specified by STR.


-device STR
   specifies that this attachment is associated with the device STR.
   Currently, it is accepted only for compatibility with other I/O
   modules.
-ebcdic
   converts control information and data to its EBCDIC representation
   before transmission.  This is the default.
-horizontal_tab, -htab
   supports tab control on the remote I/O terminal printer.  Tabs are
   set every 10 spaces.  The default is no tab control.
-multi_record
   transmits multiple records (up to seven) as a block, rather than
   separately.  The default is single-record transmission.
-nontransparent
   uses a nontransparent communication protocol.  This is the default.


-printer_select STR
   the two-character string STR sets the printer select.  The default
   printer select string is ESC/.
-physical_line_length N, -pll N
   sets the maximum character width of the remote I/O terminal printer
   to N characters.  The default is 80 characters.  This variable is
   used to set tabs and pad records if the transparent option is
   specified.
-punch_select STR
   the two-character string STR sets the punch select.  The default
   punch select string is ESC4.
-slew_ctl STR
   the six-character string STR, taken two characters at a time, sets
   the slew control characters that specify top of form, inside page,
   and outside page.  The default set of characters is ESCA, ESCA, and
   ESCA.


-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   STR specifies the terminal type whose conversion, translation, and
   special tables defined in the user or system terminal type table
   (TTT) are used to convert and translate input and output to and from
   the device.  If not specified, no conversion or translation is
   performed.  For more information about the allowable conversion
   values see "Notes" below.
-transparent
   uses a transparent communication protocol.
-tty STR
   connects the remote I/O station to the communications channel named
   STR.


Open Operation:
The ibm2780_ I/O module supports stream_input, stream_output, and
stream_input_output opening modes.


Put Chars Operation:
The put_chars entry splits the data to be written into blocks of 80 or
400 characters, depending on whether multirecord mode is enabled, and
transmits the number of characters specified to the specified
communications I/O module.  The blocks are of fixed or variable length,
depending on whether transparent mode is enabled or not, respectively.


Get Chars Operation:
The get_chars entry reads characters up to 80 or 400 characters,
depending on whether multirecord is enabled, and returns the number
requested, up to the next record separator.


Control Operation:
   This I/O module supports all the control operations supported by the
   communications I/O module specified in the attach description.  In
   addition, it supports the following:
select_device
   selects the subdevice (printer, punch, or teleprinter) to which
   output is next directed.  The input structure is of the form:
      dcl device char(32) based;
set_bsc_modes
   sets the character mode, either ascii or ebcdic, and transparency.
   The input structure is defined as follows:
      dcl 1 set_bsc_modes aligned,
            2 char_mode bit(1), unaligned,
            2 transparent bit(1) unaligned;


   where:
   char_mode
      is "1"b if ebcdic and "0"b if ascii.
   transparent
      is "1"b if transparency is enabled and "0"b if not.
set_multi_record_mode
   sets the number of records per block.  The input structure is of the
   form:
      dcl record_number fixed bin based;


Modes Operation:
This module supports the nonedited and default modes, which set and
reset the edited output conversion, if it has been enabled by the
-terminal_type control argument.


Notes:
The only allowable values in the output conversion table are 00 and any
values greater than 16.  All values defined in the description of the
tty_ I/O module are allowed for input conversion.  Input and output
translation tables can be up to 256 characters in length.
