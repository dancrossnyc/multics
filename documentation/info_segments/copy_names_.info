:Entry: copy_names_:  1980-11-03  copy_names_

Function: This subroutine copies all the names from one entry to
another.  Name duplications are handled by nd_handler_.


Syntax:
dcl copy_names_ ext entry (char(*),char(*),char(*),char(*),
	      char(*),bit(1) aligned,fixed bin(35));
call copy_names_ (dir1, en1, dir2, en2, caller, errsw, code);


Arguments:
dir1
   the directory in which the original segment is found. (Input)
en1
   a name on the original segment. (Input)
dir2
   the target segment's directory. (Input)
en2
   a name already on the target segment. (Input)
caller
   the name of the calling procedure; it is used in calls to
   nd_handler_. (Input)


errsw
   indicates which segment the error indicated by "code" occurred
   on; it is set to "0"b if the error was on the original segment
   and to "1"b if on the target. (Output)
code
   a standard File System status code. (Output)


Notes: If name duplication occurs due to another entry having the
same name as the entry being copied, the status code
error_table_$namedup is returned.  Otherwise, if name duplication
occurs due to a name being copied, the code error_table_$segnamedup
is returned.
