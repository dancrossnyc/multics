07/08/80  make_pps_tape

Syntax: make_pps_tape target_spec paths


Function: allows a user to make a tape to be printed on the PPS


Arguments:
target_desc
   either "-volume volname" or "-vol volname" to specify the tape
   volume; or "-target_description attach_description" or "-tds
   attach_description to specify the target attach description.
path
   is the pathname of a segment to be printed on the PPS.


Notes: make_pps_tape attaches the output tape using either the attach
   description provided by the user or one of the form "pps_ -vol XX"
   where XX was specified as the volume name by the user.  The -tds
   control argument must be used when control arguments other than
   -vol are desired in the attach description.
   
   Each pathname specified in the command line is written as a
   separate report on the output tape.
   
   make_pps_tape does not produce PPS control blocks on the output
   tape.  For this reason the user must inform the PPS operator as to
   the paramaters to be used in printing the information on the tape.
