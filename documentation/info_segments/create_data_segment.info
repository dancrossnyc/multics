02/29/84  create_data_segment, cds

Syntax:  cds path {-control_arg}


Function: translates a create_data_segment (CDS) source program into
an object segment.  A listing segment is optionally created.  These
results are placed in your working directory.  This command cannot be
called recursively.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a CDS segment; the cds suffix need not be given.


Control arguments:
-list, -ls
   produces a source listing of the CDS program followed by object
   segment information (as printed by the print_link_info command)
   about the actual object segment created.


Notes: Because of the invocation of the PL/I compiler, the CDS run is
aborted if a severity error greater than 2 occurs.
