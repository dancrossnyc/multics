Description

1151  
The paragraph macros (..p0, etc.)  mishandle pending undents when
interacting with table mode.

1150  
In order to improve performance, various pdir database initialization
statements are controlled by the -debug option switch.  One such
controlled initialization step causes "loaner" charsets to be not
loaded and leads to null pointer fault failures in x9700_writer_.

1149  
If an output line in font A begins with ".ur %.fnt B%X ..." where X is
borrowed from font A, X does not appear in the output.

1148  
The underscore character is missing from the fonts used for level 0 and
level 1 headers.

1147  
The left and right double quotes characters are missing in the fonts
used for level headers.

1146  
If a font contains both borrowed and native characters, and the
borrowed characters are given first, the wrong character set index
value is emitted for the native characters.

1145  
Compdv references an obsolete variable when calculating the size of a
font size table.

1144  
Certain short lines at the ends of paragraphs do not have change bars
even though change bars are active.

1143  
In certain cases, the presence of a .hit control in a compin file
destroys the output format in galley mode by trying to emit page header
slugs.

1142  
If the first line in a block has a hanging undent, the x9700 module
neglects to set the character set pointer and fails with a null pointer
fault.

1141  
In some cases, the program fails to detect an attempt to pop an empty
font stack and fails with an indeterminant error caused by garbage
being pointed to by an invalid pointer variable.

1140  
Attempts to place text titles in keep blocks after table mode has been
used (and properly exited) in the block fail with the subscriptrange
error in comp_title_block_.

1139  
Version mismatch problems were found in >exl>cd>macros>old.(l1h tab
toc).compin.  They have been reinstalled.

1138  
Artwork lines are not correctly counted in filled text.  This causes
occasional failure to expand artwork when .bba N is used in filled
text.

1137  phx19820
When switching from filled to unfilled text in the middle of a block,
if the last line of filled text consists of nothing but a font change
string, it is properly discarded, but the desired font change does get
propagated to the first unfilled line.

1136  phx19819
A text <title> given in and intended for a table column, gets placed
with the wrong margin values.

1135  
Printwheel changing for the hyterm device is broken.

1134  phx19665
The version of compdv.incl.alm in >exl>cd>include isnt the version
expected by >exl>cd>e>compdv.

1133  phx19663 phx19664
A zealous user has discovered several instances of illegal PL/I that
are potential problem points.

1132  phx19639
The program fails when attempting to attach an unreferenced footnote to
a text title block.

1131  phx19964
Under the "right" conditions, the program inserts hyphens into hanging
undent fields.

1130  
See #1129.  The same problem occurs with other file accessing errors,
such as no_r_permission or zero_length_seg.  

1129  phx19632
If compose is invoked with -pass 2 and an insert file is found to not
exist during pass 1, its name is not erased from the insert file
database and, during pass 2, finding that bogus insert file name causes
a failure with a subscriptrange error in comp_get_file_.

1128  phx19630 phx19823
When an existing block is converted to a table block (.tan control) and
processing is sent to an unfilled table column (.tac control), the text
alignment mode (left/center/right/etc.)  for that table column isnt
propagated correctly.

1127  phx19629
If a return (.rt) control is encountered within a conditional execution
group (.if/.endif) in a file given in the command line, the processing
of the file is aborted correctly but an extraneous error message
complains of nontermination of the conditional execution group.

1124  phx19624
Font changes given between contiguous title lines (eg, .thl .../.fnt
A/.thl ...)  have no effect.

1123  phx19550 phx14849 phx19860 phx19881
This entry is a "catchall" so as to provide a place to record TR
reported problems that can no longer be reproduced with DEV compose and
must be presumed fixed in the course of development.

1122  phx19547
The merging of table entry lines at the same page depth is done at the
wrong place in the flow of processing.  Because of this, tables
inserted into embedded keeps are badly malformatted, and can cause
program aborts and fatal process errors.

1121  phx19546
If .brp is given with "e" or "o" and the page number must be
incremented, the change takes place one page too late.

1120  phx19545
"Popping" an empty font stack with ".fnt " (note the trailing blank)
causes a failure with a subscriptrange error.

1119  phx19516
A footnote given in a short (<= twice the widow size) block is lost
when that block appears at the bottom of the page and *would* fit
without the note.

1118  
When the .wrt control is given a <path> longer than 32 characters, only
the first 32 are trimmed and rest get written to the target file.

1117  
If the .spd control is used to end a text block, the space used by that
block isnt counted and too much white space is inserted.

1116  
If the addition of a text line to a page signals a page overflow and
subsequent trimming of leading whitespace on that page allows the
remaining text to fit, the page is ejected anyway and the program fails
with a null pointer fault in comp_break_ on the next page.

1115  phx19521
The program fails to diagnose an attempt to redefine columns within a
keep block and produces badly mangled output.  This attempt must be a
limitation since the program cannot know how the user intends the
subsequent text to be placed on the page.  A diagnostic message has
been added.

1114  phx19495
The vip7801_writer_ module fails with a null pointer fault due to
improper output image initialization.

1113  phx19482
All device writer modules fail with a null pointer fault when asked to
prepare an output page image with more than 32640 lines.

1112  
If a page contains only trimmable white space, the space is trimmed but
the page is left marked as already headed.  This can cause the next
page to have the wrong page number if that next page starts a new
section of a document (ie, it has a different page number structure).

1111  phx19349
When the break-column (.brc) control is used to move from one column to
another on a multicolumn page, the space needed to fill out the current
column is added twice.  This causes the target column to start too low
on the page.

1110  phx19426
Changes made for error 1104 have caused conditional execution group
(.if/.endif controls) nesting levels to be miscounted when processing
labels (.go and .la controls).  This causes error messages and macro
logic failures.

1109  
For the x9700 device, font characters that are "borrowed" from another
character set are not displayed.  Further, if there are explcit font
changes in the same line as the borrowed characters that invoke the
"borrowed from" character set, the x9700 module loops.

1108  
The apparent absence of the EMspace character in the X9700 character
set that supports the 'ascii' (aka 'typ') font causes lines using those
fonts to be mispositioned and/or overprinted.

1107  
For the x9700 device, if an output line has a left margin change mark,
has NO internal font changes, is longer than the hardware linelength
limitation (thus requiring an extension overlay for correct printing),
AND the first line of the text block also has a left margin change bar,
the extension overlay for the line is emitted with the font select
character for the left margin font of that first line.  This causes
certain extension overlays to be printed in the wrong font.

1106  phx19310
The x9700_un gives the wrong value in the declaration of pixel size.
This causes positioning discrepancies when user given horizontal length
values (eg, .inl 3) are adjusted for device resolution.

1105  phx19299
If the addition of a text line to the output page triggers a page
overflow event and the trimming of leading white space results in a
short page, the next input text line fails with a null pointer fault in
comp_.

1104  phx19282
The limitation on use of .go exiting a conditional execution group isnt
properly diagnosed and reported.  Remove the limitation.

1103  phx19272
A free standing picture that doesn't fit on the current page is placed
differently than an identical picture at the same page position that's
given within a text block.

1102  phx19265
The program fails to detect and diagnose violations of the limit on
nesting of conditional execution groups (.if ...  .endif controls) and
fails with a subscriptrange condition.

1101  phx19260
Differences in the declared length of two character string variables
cause failure with a stringrange error for the 101st label in a compin
file.

1100  phx19239
The program is unable to handle zero widow size (.wi 0 control) and
fails trying to split a one line block.  The usual error is a
subscriptrange condition.

1099  phx19248 phx19247
The program attempts to do preliminary syntax checking on active
strings (eg, %[string a b c]%) and sometimes makes egregious errors.
This prechecking is a leftover from an ancient cu_ interface and has
been removed.

1098  phx19246
The text alignment mode (left, center, etc.)  isnt handled properly
when switching table mode formats.  This causes certain table lines to
be malformatted.

1097  
<title> lines in footnotes are not handled properly.

1093  
Extensive use of page header/footer redefinition by individual line
index numbers (eg, use of ".hla N ..." when there is already a page
header) in big files can result in a record-quota-overflow in the
process_directory.  Use of this feature should be limited to only those
places where it is absolutely necessary.

1085  phx19068 phx19288
In some cases when the amount of text to be placed on a multicolumn
page is very small, the column balancing algorithm produces remarkably
poor output.

1068  phx19125
If frob.compout is an addname on frob.compin, 'compose frob -of' fails
with a stringrange error when trying to report the input file overwrite
situation.

985  phx15911
The artwork feature is limited to ONLY straight lines (horizontal,
vertical, and slanted), boxes, diamonds, and lozenges.  Any more
general graphic constructs such as 8-sided polygons and some 6-sided
polygons, and random combinations of line segments are not supported
and will not yield the desired results.

946  phx15466
File content-dependent fields in page headers on multi-column pages are
not accurately shown because the page make-up process is asynchronous
with the text input stream.

939  
Input files with names of the form FOO.compin.compin are unacceptable.

875  phx14759
The program is overzealous in "protecting" (escaping) the special
syntax characters (eg, quotes, asterisks,...)  in lines read by the
LineInput builtin.  This makes the passage of control lines with
variable fields through the interface virtually impossible.

831  phx14380
When a titled picture block is inserted into a titled paragraph, the
page numbers for both may appear incorrectly in the TOC.

824  phx14034 phx15334
The program does not allow mixing of held and printed footnotes in the
same document.

759  phx11480
Table mode in special blocks (page headers, text headers, etc.)  is
mishandled.  This problem is classed as a limitation because it would be
very difficult to extend table mode into headers block and the probable
utility of doing so is judged quite small.
