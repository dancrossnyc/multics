          Errata Information for MR12.5


pg 3-6:  for the "add_name" command, add a CONTROL ARGUMENTS
     section (after the ARGUMENTS section) containing the
     following.

     -brief, -bf
         suppresses the error message "Name already on entry"

     -interpret_as_extended_entry -inaee
         interprets the selected entry as an extended entry type


     -interpret_as_standard_entry -inase
         interprets the selected entry as a standard entry type

     -long, -lg
         does not suppress the error message "Name already on
         entry" (Default)


pg 3-22:  for the "calc" command, under NOTES ON ASSIGNMENT
     STATEMENTS replace the sentence that begins "The name of the
     variable must be..."  with the following.

     The name of the variable must be from one to eight
     characters in length and must be made up of letters
     (uppercase and/or lowercase), digits (if not at the
     beginning of the name), and the underscore character (_).


pg 3-27:  for the "cancel_output_request" command, in the NOTES
     section replace "If the request is already running,...
     ...are ignored by the system" (two paragraphs) with the
     following.

     If the request is already running, the running request will
     not be stopped and the request's entry will not be removed
     from the queue.  A warning message will be displayed to warn
     the user of this action.


pg 3-32:  for the "copy" command, under NOTES add the paragraph
     below.
pg 3-34; for the "copy_dir" command, under NOTES add the
     paragraph below.
pg 3-126; for the "move" command, under NOTES add the paragraph
     below.

     If copying a non-empty mailbox requires that the max_length
     characteristic of the source be applied to the target, then
     the target max_length value will take on the default value
     that was given to it when created.


pg 3-45:  for the "delete_name" command, add the following under
     the CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

     -interpret_as_extended_entry -inaee
         interprets the selected entry as an extended entry type

     -interpret_as_standard_entry -inase
         interprets the selected entry as a standard entry type


pg 3-55:  for the "enter_abs_request" command, under ARGUMENTS
     change the description of "path" to the following.

     path
         specifies the pathname of the absentee control segment
         associated with this request.  The absin suffix is
         assumed.  If a pathname is given, it identifies the
         absin segment.  If only an entryname is given, the absin
         segment is located using the exec_com search list.


pg 3-55:  for the "enter_abs_request" command, add the following
     to the CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

     -authorization STR, -auth STR
         sets the authorization of the process to that specified
         by STR.  STR is a character string composed of level and
         category names for the desired authorization, separated
         by commas.  STR cannot contain any embedded blank or tab
         characters.  (The short names for each level and
         category always contain no blanks or tabs, and can be
         used whenever the corresponding long names contain
         blanks or tabs.)  STR must represent an authorization
         that is within the range of minimum and maximum
         authorization of Person_id on the Project_id.


         If -authorization is omitted, your current login
         authorization is used.  (See the Programmer's Reference
         Manual for more information about process
         authorizations.)  Allowed authorization range can be
         displayed via the "user auth_range" command.


     -home_dir path, -hd path
         sets the home directory of the absentee process to the
         path specified, if the project administrator allows such
         changes.  The "user attributes" command displays allowed
         attributes.  The vhomedir attribute is required to use
         the -home_dir control argument.  The specified home dir
         cannot exceed 64 characters and must be specified as an
         absolute pathname.

     -no_start_up, -ns
         instructs the standard process overseer not to execute
         the start_up.ec segment in the absentee process, if the
         project administrator allows it.  The "user attributes"
         command displays allowed attributes.  The nostartup
         attribute is required to use this control argument.


     -process_overseer path, -po path
         sets the process overseer for the absentee process to
         the procedure given by path if the project administrator
         allows this.  If path ends in the characters ",direct",
         the specified procedure is called directly during
         process initialization rather than by the standard
         system-provided procedure.  This means that the program
         used by path must perform the tasks that would have been
         performed by the standard procedure.  The length of the
         process_overseer path should not exceed 64 characters.
         The "user attributes" command displays allowed
         attributes.  The vinitproc attribute is required to use
         this control argument.


     -ring N, -rg N
         sets the initial ring to N if this ring number is within
         the range of the registered minimum ring and maximum
         ring.  This range may be displayed via the "user
         ring_range" command.

     -start_up
         instructs the standard process overseer to execute the
         start_up.ec segment if it exists.  (Default)


pg 3-57:  for the "enter_abs_request" command, add the following
     to the NOTES section.

     When -proxy is given, no attempt is made by ear to validate
     attribute dependent control arguments.  Since the job is
     submitted on behalf of another user, the attributes for the
     proxy user will be validated only by the answering service
     when it attempts to run the job.  Attribute dependent
     control arguments are:

          -no_start_up
          -home_dir
          -authorization
          -process_overseer
          -ring


pg 3-64:  for the "exec_com" command (version 2), under LIST OF
     LITERALS add the following after the description of &NL.

     &CR, &CR(N)
         expands to a single carriage return character (ASCII
         015) or to N carriage returns.


pg 3-72:  for the "exec_com" command (version 2), under LIST OF
     CONTRUCTS replace the line

         &&NL, &QT, &SP, &VT List of literals
     with
         &&NL, &CR, &QT, &SP, &VT List of literals


pg 3-101:  for the "link" command, under the "-chase" control
     argument, replace "ia" with "is".


pg 3-121:  for the "memo" command, under LIST OF MEMO OPTIONS
     delete the following sentence under the description of the
     "-repeat_when_processed" control argument.

     This is useful for memos that are only significant within a
     single process.


pg 3-139:  change the documentation for the "program_interrupt"
     command to the following.

     NAME

     program_interrupt, pi

     SYNTAX AS A COMMAND

     pi {-control_arg}


     FUNCTION

     informs a suspended invocation of an interactive subsystem
     that you wish to abort a subsystem request and reenter the
     subsystem.


     CONTROL ARGUMENTS

     -no_restore, -ns
         does not restore the standard I/O attachments (see
         "Notes").


     NOTES

     The program interrupt command is used with interactive
     subsystems.  Interactive subsystems are commands that accept
     user requests from the terminal.  To abort a subsystem
     request, the user uses the quit (or break) key to interrupt
     execution, and then gives the program_interrupt command.  If
     the subsystem supports the use of the program_interrupt
     command, it will abort the interrupted request and ask the
     user for a new one.  If the subsystem does not support the
     use of program_interrupt, the command will print an error
     message.  The user may then either restart the interrupted
     operation with the "start" command, or abort the entire
     subsystem invocation with the "release" command.


     This command restores the attachments of the user_input,
     user_output, and error_output switches and the mode of
     user_i/o to their values at the time of interruption unless
     you give -no_restore.

     If there is more than one suspended command in your stack,
     the stack is searched for a program that supports
     program_interrupt and any intervening programs are released.


pg 3-150:  for the "query" command, add the following to the
     CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

     -no_trim
         does not trim trailing spaces from the question
         argument.

     -trim
         trims trailing spaces from the question argument.
         (Default)


pg 3-150:  for the "query" command, add the following to the
     CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

     -no_trim
         does not trim trailing spaces from the question
         argument.

     -trim
         trims trailing spaces from the question argument.
         (Default)


pg 3-157:  for the "rename" command, add the following to the
     CONTROL ARGUMENTS section.

     -interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
         interprets the selected entry as an extended entry type.

     -interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
         interprets the selected entry as a standard entry type.


pg 3-181:  for the "status" command, replace the description of   |
     the "-author" control argument with the following:           |
                                                                  |
     -author, -at                                                 |
         prints the author of the entry.  The author is the name  |
         of the user who created the segment or directory.  This  |
         attribute cannot be modified.                            |


pg 3-182:  for the "status" command, under LIST OF TYPE-SPECIFIC  |
     CONTROL ARGUMENTS, replace the description of "-bc_author"   |
     with the following:                                          |
                                                                  |
     -bc_author, -bca                                             |
         prints the bit count author of the entry.  The bit count |
         author is the name of the user who last set the bit      |
         count of the segment or directory.  This attribute is    |
         automatically updated when the bit count is set.  Not    |
         valid for DM files.                                      |


pg 3-195:  replace the documentation for the "working_dir"
     command with the following.

     SYNTAX AS A COMMAND

     wd {LOCATIONS} {-control_arg}

     SYNTAX AS AN ACTIVE FUNCTION

     [wd {LOCATIONS}]


     FUNCTION

     prints or returns the pathname of the current working
     directory.  Optional arguments can be given to print or
     return entries on the stack of working directories.  Refer
     to the change_wdir command for a description of the working
     directory stack.


     ARGUMENTS

     LOCATIONS
         selects entries on the working directory stack to be
         printed or returned.  LOCATION can be an integer
         position N from the top of the stack; or a text LABEL
         associated with a stack entry; or one of the reserved
         words first (f), last (l) or all (a).  The reserved word
         first identifies the current working directory (which is
         not on the stack of prior working directories and is
         displayed above stack position 1); last identifies the
         bottom stack entry; and all identifies the current
         working directory plus all stacked directories.


         More than one LOCATION can be given to select several
         entries.  Individual locations are separated by a space.
         A LOCATION_RANGE is given by a starting and ending
         LOCATION separated by a colon.  For example, f:2
         identifies the current working directory and the top two
         directories on the stack, and 1:XXX identifies stack
         entries from the top of the stack to the entry with
         label XXX.


     CONTROL ARGUMENTS

     -header, -he
         displays a heading of the form:  LOC LABEL PATHNAME.
         The default is to print a heading when more than one
         directory is displayed.

     -no_header, -nhe
         suppresses the heading before the stack contents are
         displayed.  [default]


     NOTES

     Since the working_dir is returned in quotes, the command
     processor treats it as a single argument regardless of
     special characters in the name.


     The current working directory is located at location zero.
     The most recent prior working directory is at the stack
     position 1 and the least recent prior working directory is
     at the Nth (last position).  If a stack of prior working
     directories is empty then only the current working directory
     is printed.  For the case when the current working directory
     has been deleted, an attempt to print it out will display
     the "directory has been deleted" message in square brackets,
     separated from the directory pathname by a blank space.
     This does not apply when one or more prior working
     directories on the stack have been deleted.  See also the
     change_wdir (cwd) command for stack features.


     Examples:  Assume the stack looks like the following:

        0     >udd>m>tai>archive_dev
        1     >udd>m>tai>abbrev_dev
        2 XXX >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev
        3     >udd>m>tai

     then

        ! wd XXX
        2 XXX >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev

        ! wd 2 -he
        LOC LABEL PATHNAME


          2 XXX >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev

        ! wd f:XXX
        LOC LABEL PATHNAME

          0     >udd>m>tai>archive_dev
          1     >udd>m>tai>abbrev_dev
          2 XXX >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev

        ! string [wd XXX]
        >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev

        ! string [wd 2]
        >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev


        ! string [wd a]
        >udd>m>tai>archive_dev >udd>m>tai>abbrev_dev
             >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev >udd>m>tai

        ! dd >udd>m>tai>archive_dev
        ! wd a
        LOC LABEL PATHNAME

          0    >udd>m>tai>archive_dev [directory has been deleted]
          1    >udd>m>tai>abbrev_dev
          2 XXX >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev
          3    >udd>m>tai


        ! string [wd a]
        >udd>m>tai>archive_dev >udd>m>tai>abbrev_dev
             >udd>m>tai>cwd_dev >udd>m>tai
