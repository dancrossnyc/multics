03/06/85  forum_add_participant, fapt

Syntax as a command:  fapt meeting_name Person_id {-control_args}


Function:  makes the person identified by Person_id eligible to attend
the meeting_name meeting.  You can use this request if you have either
modify permision on the containing directory or chairman access to the
meeting.


Arguments:
meeting_name
   is the pathname or entryname of the meeting to be adjusted.
   Pathnames contain greater-than (>) or less-than (<) characters.  If
   a pathname is specified, it identifies the meeting to be adjusted.
   Otherwise, fapt searches for the meeting_name by using the forum
   search list.
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the participant to be added.


Control arguments:
-chairman, -cm
   gives chairman access to the added participant.  This control
   argument is not valid for meetings created with pre-MR11 software.
-read_only, -ro
   allows the added participant to read transactions but not enter
   them.


Notes:  The -read_only and -chairman control arguments cannot both be
specified.

To change the access of a participant to read only, use the fapt
command with the -read_only control argument to add the participant
again.  This will change the original access of the participant to read
only.

The  meeting  chairman  can  use  the convert_forum command to convert
meetings  created  with pre-MR11 software to current version meetings.
The  old version meeting is left untouched and should be deleted using
the  forum_delete  command.   To  avoid  deleting  the current version
meeting,  you  must  include  the  ".control" suffix at the end of the
meeting_name.
