02/21/84  delete_proj

Syntax:  delete_proj Project_id


Function:  is used by the dproj command in the master.ec segment.  It
does a portion of the work of deleting a project.  (Other commands
called by master.ec do the remainder.)


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the name of the project to be deleted.


Notes:  The entries for the specified project are marked as deleted in
the administrator's copy of the SAT (smf.cur.sat) and in the projfile
and reqfile segments.  Those entries are not physically removed
however.  In addition, the name "delete.Project_id.pdt" is added to the
Project_id.pdt segment in >sc1>pdt as a reminder that this PDT should
be deleted (by the system administrator) after the next monthly bills
are run.
