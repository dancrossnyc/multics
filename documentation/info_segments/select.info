Syntax:  select test_string {args}


Syntax as active function:  [select test_string {args}]


Function:  tests a set of arguments and returns those arguments that
pass the test.  The test is given as the first argument and is used to
select the second-through-last arguments.  A string consisting of the
concatenation of all the arguments that pass the test, separated by
spaces, is returned.  Each argument is requoted.


Arguments:
test_string
   is the test to apply to each argument.  See "Notes" below.
args
   are the arguments to be tested.  Any number of arguments, including
   zero, can be supplied.


Notes:  Each argument is requoted, and the following active string is
constructed:

     [test_string argi]

The active string is evaluated.  The result must be either "true" or
"false."  If the result is "true," argi is selected and the requoted
argument appears in the result string.  If the result is "false," the
argument is not selected.
