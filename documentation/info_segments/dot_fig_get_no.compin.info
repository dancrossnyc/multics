12/14/80  dot_fig_get_no.compin

Syntax:  .ifi dot_fig_get_no n


Function:
This compose macro generates the number of a "dot number" figure other
than the current figure.


Arguments:
'n' is an integer; the number of the nth "dot number" figure relative
   to the current figure.


Notes:
1) The number of the nth "dot number" figure relative to the current
   figure (e.g., -1 = first preceding, 2 = second following) is
   calculated and set into the 'figure' compose variable.  The form of
   the number is the same as that generated by the dot_fig macro (see
   dot_fig.compin.info.)  'figure' is used to refer to the desired
   figure.
2) See dot_fig.compin.info, fig.compin.info, dot_fig_index.compin.info,
   fig_index.compin.info, and fig_on.compin.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines reference the next three "dot number" figures that
follow Figure 2 in the text of an unsectioned document.

     .ifi dot_fig_get_no 1
     .ur Figure %figure%,
     .ifi dot_fig_get_no 2
     .ur Figure %figure%, and
     .ifi dot_fig_get_no 3
     .ur Figure %figure% below illustrate these results.

Figure 2.1, Figure 2.2, and Figure 2.3 below illustrate these results.
