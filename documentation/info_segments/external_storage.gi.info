08/22/83  External Storage

External storage (PL/I external variables and FORTRAN common blocks)
is usually allocated by the dynamic linker when a program is run.  The
size and initial value is determined by information associated with
the first procedure that references the storage.  If another procedure
subsequently references the same storage, the linker ignores any
associated initialization value.  If the size indicated is larger than
that allocated, the linker signals linkage_error.  In this case, the
program cannot be restarted.


There are four ways of ensuring that the correct sizes and initial
values are allocated:

   1) Make all declarations for an external variable identical.
      (Recommended)
   2) Bind together all procedures that reference the same external
      storage.
   3) Use the set_fortran_common command before running the program,
      giving it the names of all procedures containing relevant
      information about external storage (largest sizes, correct
      initial values, etc.) (Warning--continued operation with PL/I
      procedures is not guaranteed).
   4) Compile together all FORTRAN programs referencing the same common
      blocks.  The list_external_variables command can be used to
      display information about external variables or common blocks
      already allocated.

See allocation_storage.gi for general information on system storage
areas.
