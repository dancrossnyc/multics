Syntax as a command:  fl control_string {args}


Syntax as an active function:  [fl control_string {args}]


Function: returns a single, quoted character string that is formatted
from an ioa_ control string and other optional arguments.


Arguments:
control_string
   is an ioa_ control string used to format the return value of the
   active function (see "Notes" below).
args
   are character strings substituted in the formatted return value
   according to the control string.


Notes: The following ioa_ control codes are allowed (see the
ioa_ subroutine).  The control string is output exactly as is except
that certain constructs beginning with a caret (^) are expanded, which
may involve argument substitution or interpretation.  Unimplemented
constructs are output as is, but avoid them to allow for future
extensions.


 CONTROL           ACCEPTABLE ARGUMENTS
 ^a   ^Na          any character string
 ^d   ^Nd          a character representation of a number, including
                   optional exponent (315.44 or .2789e+2 or 1101b)
 ^i   ^Ni          same as ^d
 ^f   ^Nf          same as ^d
 ^.Df ^N.Df        same as ^d
 ^e   ^Ne          same as ^d
 ^o   ^No          same as ^d
 ^[...^            "true", "false", or an integer character string
 ...^]             any number of any character string
 ^(...^) or
 ^N(...^)          an integer character string.
 ^s  ^Ns


In addition, you can use any of the following carriage movement
controls:
      ^N/      ^N|      ^N-
      ^Nx      ^N^      ^R
      ^B       ^t       ^Nt
      ^N.Dt    ^/       ^|
      ^-       ^x       ^^
where N is an integer count or a "v".  When you give "v", an integer
character string from the args is used for count.

If you don't give optional arguments, the value returned depends on the
ioa_ control string that you specified.
