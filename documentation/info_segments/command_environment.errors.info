Description

0123  phx12861
abbrev reports profile segment creation via com_err_ instead of ioa_.

0111  phx19356
 cu_$caller_ptr should ignore entrypoints whose stack frame's support
 bit is set when finding the caller's caller.  Otherwise, programs
 which must know the identity of their caller (e.g.,
 mseg_mbx_ms_gate_target_) will not work properly when traced.

0109  phx19226
 The command line
      string (A(1) B(1)C)
 produces as output "A1C" and "B1C".  The first string should be
 "A1".  This problem may be related to error #0006 on this list.

0108  phx19201
 The implementation of replaceable procedures in the ssu_ transfer
 vector does not work if the entrypoint has been replaced by an
 internal procedure.  The display pointer neded by the internal
 procedure to access its parent's storage is not passed on by ssu_.

0106  phx18895
 The summarize_requests (?)  request should guarentee that a single
 request's names all appear in the same column.  However,
 summarize_requests may split the names between columns if it needs to
 use more than one line for a given request's names.

0105  phx18387
 The summarize_requests (?)  request will attempt to divide by zero if
 the user's terminal line length is unusually short.

0104  phx17970 phx18299
 The "-exact" control argument of the standard list_requests request
 will either print incorrect request descriptions or generate
 out_of_bounds faults.

0103  phx17795
 The method employed by ssu_$record_usage and ssu_$print_blast to
 determine whether the user has write access to the "ssusage" segment
 causes needless access violation audit messages on multi-level
 systems.  These entrypoints should use hcs_$fs_get_mode to determine
 the user's access before attempting to write into the "ssusage"
 segment.

0100  phx17389
 The error message produced by the standard exec_com request when it
 can not find the exec_com via the subsystem's search list is:
      Entry not found.  NAME
 This message does not provide any information to allow a user to
 determine what went wrong.  The message should be:
      NAME.SUFFIX not found via the LIST search list.

0097  phx16423
 ssu_$execute_start_up does not validate that the optional arguments
 for the start_up exec_com are all varying or non-varying character
 strings.  In addition, if the last argument is a varying string,
 ssu_$execute_start_up must convert it to a non-varying string to pre-
 vent exec_com from assuming that the start_up exec_com had been
 invoked as an active function.

0093  phx16187 phx17997
 If an active string within an iteration set returns a value which
 contains iteration sets, the command processor will fault in the
 read_list internal procedure.  Eg:
      string ([do "(A B)"])

0091  phx14724
 find_command_ should terminate the segment it found when it
 reports an error for the segment such as "Linkage section not
 found."

0090  phx14559 phx16555
 The ".u" request expands beginning-of-line abbreviations in the
 profile pathname; it shouldn't.

0089  phx14545 phx15560
 The procedure which validates info directories does not ignore
 error_table_$no_s_permission when returned by its call to
 hcs_$status_long to get the directory's unique ID.

0086  phx14268 phx17126
 The standard abbrev request does not accept "-pf" as the short form of
 "-profile".

0085  phx15564 phx15412
 The execute request should requote its arguments when building the
 Multics command line/active string.  In addition, when invoked as an
 active request, execute should prevent Multics from rescanning the re-
 sult of the active string so that any rescanning is done solely by the
 request processor.  This last change is necessary to allow use of
 "||[...]" and "|[...]" constructs with the execute active request.

0084  
 If a fault occurs in ssu_usage_mgr_'s any_other handler, a recursive
 loop may occur which causes a fatal process error.

0074  
 The help and list_help requests should special case the info names
 "?", ".", and ".." if they have their standard meanings and
 translate them into the proper info file names.

0041  phx06923
 The active string "||[...]" should result in a single token
 regardless of the amount of iteration or use of semi-colons
 within the active string.  IE:
     format_line (||[system (next_down_time next_down_date)])
 should print a single line rather than two lines.

0008  phx15550
 Mismatched brackets and parentheses are not always detected
 before some active strings are partially evaluated.  For example:
     string [equal a b]]

0006  
 The command line:
     string (a b)(c(d() e f))
 prints "e" followed by "bcf".  It appears that it should be a
 case of mismatched iteration sets.

0005  phx00862 phx05795
 Command metering should use a set of ring-1 gates to record
 usage.  Otherwise, it (1) will not work with AIM and (2) is
 subject to damage by malicious users.

0001  phx03190
 abbrev should mask QUITs while updating the user's profile.
