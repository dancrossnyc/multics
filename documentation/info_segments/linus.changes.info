09/07/83 Introduction:
This info segment describes the user visible changes in the Logical
Inquiry and Update System (LINUS) for the MR10.2 software release.


(1) Report Writer:

LINUS has been augmented to include a Report Writer system. The
following requests make up the system: list_format_options,
set_format_options, save_format_options, restore_format_options,
display, display_builtins, and column_value. Help can be
obtained for any of these requests by typing "help request_name"
once inside LINUS. Typing "help report_writer.gi" provides a
brief introduction to the report writer; typing
"help formatting_options.gi" provides a brief introduction to
the formatting options which control the format of a report.


(2) Multics Active Functions:

The Multics active functions ltrim, rtrim, picture, format_line,
and string are now provided as LINUS active requests. They can be
used in report headers/footers and editing requests to provide
additional formatting functions.


(3) LILA Alternative

A new set of requests have been installed that make it unnecessary to
use the LILA subsystem. The requests "input_query", "print_query",
"save_query", "translate_query", "apply", and "qedx" make up the new
query replacement. Type "help REQUEST_NAME" for details on the usage
of these requests.


(4) Incompatible Changes:

Previously data manipulation requests such as "print" required that
the selection expression be translated before they were invoked. These
requests have been changed to automatically translate the selection
expression if it hasn't already been done.
