Syntax:  pmf path


Function: allows the accounting administrator to edit a Project Master
File (for an undelegated project), converts the edited PMF to a
Project Definition Table, and then installs the PDT.

The administrator is placed in the qedx editor where he is to edit the
PMF.  After exiting from qedx, the command converts the PMF to a PDT
and signals the initializer to install the PDT.  The command takes
care of updating the pmf.archive segment (in the >udd>SysAdmin>admin
directory) as well.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the PMF to be edited.
