:Entry: convert_aim_attributes_: 02/06/84  convert_aim_attributes_


Function: converts a bit(72) aligned representation of an access
authorization or access class into a character string of the form:
        LL...L:CC...C
where LL...L is an octal sensitivity level number, and CC...C is an
octal string representing the access category set.


Syntax:
declare convert_aim_attributes_ entry (bit(72) aligned, char(32)
     aligned);
call convert_aim_attributes_ (aim_bits, aim_chars);


Arguments:
aim_bits
   is the binary representation to be converted.  (Input)
aim_chars
   is the character string representation.  (Output)


Notes:  Only significant digits of the level number (usually a single
digit from 0 to 7) are printed.

Currently, only 18 access category bits are used, so that only six
octal digits are required to represent access categories.  Therefore,
aim_chars is padded on the right with blanks, which may be used at a
later time for additional access information.  Trailing zeros are NOT
stripped.

If either the level or category field of aim_bits is invalid, the
erroneous field is returned as full octal (6 digits for level, 12
digits for category), followed by the string "(undefined)".
