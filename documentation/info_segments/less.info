Syntax:  less STRA STRB


Syntax as active function:  [less STRA STRB]


Function:  returns true if STRA is less than STRB according to ASCII
collating sequence; otherwise it returns false.


Notes:  The strings are compared character by character according to
their ASCII code value (i.e., if the first character in each string has
the same ASCII code value, compare the second character; if their
values are identical, compare the third character; etc.).  See the
descriptions of nless and ngreater for a way to compare numeric
strings.
