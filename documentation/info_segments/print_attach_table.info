02/02/79  print_attach_table, pat

Syntax:  pat {switch_names} {-control_args}


Function: prints a list of I/O switches and information about them.


Arguments: 
switch_names
   are starnames used to select the switches to be processed.
   If no switch_names are specified, all I/O switches that are currently
   attached are processed.


Control arguments: 
-name switch_name, -nm switch_name
   causes the next argument to be interpreted as a literal switchname, even if
   it looks like a starname or control argument.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the processing of the four standard switches (user_input,
   user_output, user_i/o and error_output)
-all, -a
   processes all switches, even those that are not attached.
-attached, -att
   processes only attached switches. This is the default.
-open
   processes only open switches.


Notes: The output from this command is a table listing the name of each switch
processed, its attach description (if attached) and its open description (if
open). The switches processed are selected by starname match and by whether
they match the criteria specified by the control arguments.


Syntax as an active function:  
	[pat {-control_args} {switch_names}]
returns a string containing the names of all the switches selected,
separated by spaces.
