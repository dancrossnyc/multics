10/20/86  retain_symbols, rsb

Syntax as a command:  rsb input_path {output_path} {-control_args}


Function:  takes an input text segment and inserts Speedtype escape
characters wherever symbols would be expanded if this text segment were
being processed by the expand_symbols command.  All symbols in the text
segment are thus retained during future expansion.


Arguments:
input_path
   is the pathname of the input text segment.
output_path
   is the optional pathname of an output text segment.  If no output
   pathname is specified, the original contents of the input text
   segment are overwritten.


Control arguments:
-perm
   specifies that the perm escape character is to be used.  (Default)
-temp
   specifies that the temp escape character is to be used.  Specifying
   this control argument causes the symbols in the output text segment
   to be retained for only one expansion.


Notes:  In addition to inserting the specified escape character
wherever necessary, all existing pad escapes are converted to the
specified escape.  This allows for more convenient editing of the input
text segment, since all escape characters are thus printable.
