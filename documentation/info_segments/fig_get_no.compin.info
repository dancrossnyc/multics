Syntax:  .ifi fig_get_no n


Function:
This compose macro generates the number of a figure other than the
current figure.


Arguments:
'n' is an integer; the number of the nth figure relative to the current
   figure.


Notes:
1) The number of the nth figure relative to the current figure (e.g.,
   -1 = first preceding, 2 = second following) is calculated and set
   into the 'figure' compose variable.	The form of the number is the
   same as that generated by the fig macro (see fig.info.)	'figure' is
   used to refer to the desired figure.
2) See fig.info, fig_on.info, and fig_index.info for related
   information.
