12-hour times: 24-hour times with colon, but followed by meridiem
designator which may be: am (or a), pm (or p), noon (or n), midnight
(or m).  Hour number may not exceed 12.
11:07:30.5 pm       hh:mm:ss.s meridiem
5:45 am             h:mm meridiem

12 n                12 half-day-meridiem
midnight            half-day-meridiem


Day of week: can be the name of a day of the week.  If the date is
given, the date must fall on the named day of week.  If the date is not
given, then day of the week acts as an offset.


Offsets: amount of time added to other clock values.  It is expressed
as an optionally signed fixed point number, followed by a time unit.
One or more of following offset units may be given:

   SINGULAR            PLURAL       ABBREVIATION
  microsecond       microseconds        usec
  second            seconds             sec
  minute            minutes             min
  hour              hours               hr
  day               days                da
  week              weeks               wk
  month             months              mo
  year              years               yr


Offsets are applied in the following order--
  day-of-week (as an offset)
  year
  month
  week, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond


Time zone: Here are a few of the zones available.  For a complete list,
type "display_time_info -zones".
  GMT, Greenwich Mean Time
  EST, Eastern Standard Time
  EDT, Eastern Daylight Time
Instead of a zone name, a zone designator may be used, i.e. "10A-0700".
A zone designator consists of a sign, 2 digits of hour and 2 digits of
minute.  It must always follow a time specification.


Adverbial offsets: Adverbial clauses which precede a traditional time
string.  They can have the format:

   <dayname> on or after  <trad_time_string>
   <dayname> on or before <trad_time_string>
   <dayname> after or on  <trad_time_string>
   <dayname> before or on <trad_time_string>
   <signed_offsets> before <trad_time_string>
   <signed_offsets> after <trad_time_string>


Keywords: now can be used instead of a time, to indicate the current
time of day, in the working zone.  today can be used instead of a date
to indicate today's date.  Yesterday and tomorrow can also be used, to
indicate 1 day before today and 1 day after today.


"this xxx": The xxx are units used to form a date or time.  The "this
xxx" form is used in place of a part of a date or time value, to
indicate that the current value should be used at that point.


Miscellany:

  FW198412                    fiscal week
  now
  today
  tomorrow
  yesterday


Notes: Alphabetic fields may be uppercase or lowercase, and may be
abbreviated.  The allowable abbreviations are as defined in time_info_
for the various languages it supports.  Some languages may not have
any defined short form.  Spaces are not required between alphabetic
and numeric fields, but are required between two numeric fields unless
the second number begins with a plus (+) or minus(-) sign.
Underscores may be used in place of spaces to facilitate typing of
time strings in command lines.

Day, month, and zone names are shown here in English, but they may be
given in any language which is defined in the system time_info_ table.
In a given string, all names must be in the same language.


Command examples:
day_name -1 day
   (prints day name of yesterday)

time 2.5dia -20minuto
   (prints the time 20 minutes ago 2-1/2 days from now)

time -5 hours
   (prints the time 5 hours ago)

date 10/1 -1 day +1 month
   (assuming today is 9/25/79, prints 10/31/79)


date [month]/1/[year]+1month-1day
   (prints date of last day of this month)

list -from [month]/1/[year]_midnight
   (lists files modified since first of this month, at midnight)


Time string examples:
  Tue after Mon on or after Nov 1
          (election day)
  5 hours 27 minutes after now
  today 13:00
  1 day before today
          (yesterday)
  this month 1, this year
          (the first day of this month)
  this_month/1/this_year
          (the first day of this month)
  this_hour:30
          (the half hour point of the current hour)
