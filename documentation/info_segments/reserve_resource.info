10/17/84  reserve_resource, rsr

Syntax as a command:  rsr -control_arg


Function:  reserves a resource or group of resources for use by the
calling process.  The reservation takes effect immediately and lasts
until canceled by cancel_resource or by process termination.  (See
Section 5 of the Programmer's Reference Manual for more information on
resource reservation.)


Control arguments:
-resource STR, -rsc STR
   specifies a description of the resources to be reserved.  If the
   description contains spaces or special characters, enclose it in
   quotes.  (See "Notes on resource description.")


Notes on resource description:  A resource description describes
certain devices and volumes by name or by attributes and an optional
number.  It has the following format:
   {-resource_type} resource_spec1...{-resource_type resource_specN}
which is a series of at least one resource_spec where all but the first
must be preceded by -resource_type (-rsct).


The format of a resource_spec can be any of the following--
   volume_type name1 {names}
   device_type {names}
   device_type {-control_args}
where:
volume_type
   can be either tape_vol or disk_vol.  You must supply at least one
   name with volume_type, and it is the name of the volume, for
   example, 050102.
device_type
   can be either tape_drive or disk_drive; "names" are the names of
   devices such as tape_01; if you select no names, you can choose from
   these control arguments:


   -attributes STR, -attr STR
      is a list where STR consists of a string of attributes with
      values separated by commas with no spaces.  For tape drives the
      attributes are:
         mode=
         track=
         den=
         speed=
   For disk drives the only attribute is model=.
   Use list_resource_types to find suitable values for these
   attributes.
   -number N, -nb N
      is the number of identical resources of the type desired.
