02/29/84  copy_cards, ccd

Syntax:  ccd deck_name {new_deck_name}


Function: copies specified card image segments from system pool
storage into your working directory.


Arguments:
deck_name
   is the name that was entered on the deck_id card  when the card
   deck was submitted for reading.  The star convention is allowed.
new_deck_name
   is the pathname of the segment in which the matching card image
   segment is placed.  If omitted, the working directory and deck_name
   are assumed.  The equal convention is allowed.


Notes: The segments to be copied must have been created using the
Multics card input facility.  When there are multiple copies of the
same deck in pool storage, all are copied.

When an attempt is made to read a card deck having the same name as
some previously read deck still in pool storage, a numeric suffix is
added to the name of the new deck, e.g., "deck_name.1"

Only those card decks having an access class equal to your current
authorization can be copied; other decks are not found.
