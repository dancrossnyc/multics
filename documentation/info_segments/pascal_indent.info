Syntax as a command:  pascal_indent old_path {new_path} {-control_args}


Function:  indents a Pascal source program according to a standard set
of conventions described below.  For information on Pascal see the
_M_u_l_t_i_c_s _P_a_s_c_a_l _U_s_e_r_'_s _G_u_i_d_e (GB62).


Arguments:
old_path
   is the pathname of the source segment to be indented.  The .pascal
   suffix is assumed.
new_path
   is the optional pathname of the indented result.  The .pascal suffix
   is assumed.  If you omit new_path, the indented copy replaces the
   original segment.  If errors are detected in the source, however, a
   temporary indented copy is created instead and its pathname is
   printed in an error message.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses warning messages for invalid or non-Pascal characters
   found outside a string or comment.  Errors corresponding to
   suppressed messages do not prevent the original source segment from
   being replaced.
-comment N, -com N
   indents comments at column number N.  Comments are lined up at this
   column unless they occur at the beginning of a line and are preceded
   by a blank line.  (Default:  column 61)
-english
   assumes that the source program is written in English.  (Default)
-french
   assumes that the source program is written in French.
-highlight, -hl
   translates reserved symbols of the Pascal language to lowercase if
   you provide -uc; to uppercase otherwise so that they stand out from
   the rest of the text.
-indent N, -in N
   indents each level an additional N spaces.  (Default:  5 spaces)
-lmargin N, -lm N
   sets the left margin for top-level program statements after the Nth
   column.  (Default:  10)
-long, -lg
   allows warning messages for invalid or non-Pascal characters.
   (Default)
-lower_case, -lc
   translates all uppercase letters outside of strings and comments to
   lowercase.
no_case_translation, nct
   does not translate letters outside strings and comments to uppercase
   or lowercase.  (Default)
-no_highlight, -nhl
   does not translate Pascal reserved symbols to lowercase or
   uppercase.  (Default)
-upper_case, -uc
   translates all lowercase letters outside of strings and comments to
   uppercase.


Notes on indenting style:  Multiple spaces are replaced by single
spaces, except inside strings and for nonleading spaces and tabs in
comments.  Trailing spaces and tabs are removed from all lines before
indenting.  Spaces are inserted before left parentheses, brackets, and
braces, and removed after them.  Spaces are inserted after right
parentheses, brackets, and braces, and removed before them.  Spaces are
inserted around the constructs =, ^=, <>, <=, >=, :=, ;, and :  and
operators in expressions.

Parentheses, brackets, and braces must balance.  The keywords "begin,"
"case," and "repeat" must balance with their corresponding "end"
statements; likewise for "repeat" and "until" constructs.
