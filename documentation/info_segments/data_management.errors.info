Known errors in the current release of data_management.

Description

57  phx20078
There is an inconsistency between list_entry_types and
describe_entry_type regarding DM files.  list_entry_types states that
it is selected using the string "dm_file", but you actually have to use
"describe_entry_type data_management_file".  This is because
describe_entry_type.pl1 uses the constant "data_management_file" while
the list_entry_types entry into the same program uses the
FM_OBJECT_TYPE_DM_FILE variable.

56  phx20369
The word directory is spelled directotry in an error message passed out
from dm_no_firstref_util_$get_log_path.

55  phx20201
When cv_dmcf gets a zero length segment as input, it's error message
should include this as the reason that the transation failed.

54  phx20193
The info segment cv_dmcf.info needs to be reformatted.

47  phx20213
dm_translate_system_config_ attempts to use release_temp_segment_ on
the user ring stack.  There is no real affect on the user's process or
DM, but this is very confusing when first looking at the code and
expecting to to be working correctly.

46  
tm_user_shutdown_real.pl1 directly calls a gate entry instead of
following the DM project standard of calling a transfer vector, in this
case dm_misc_util_$is_process_using_dm.

45  
The fast lock metering tool converts seconds into hours instead of
minutes.

44  
Audit changes for cm_postcommit_increment.pl1 were never installed.

43  
The automatic structure my_ci_parts in cm_get_bci_header should have a
must_be_zero field preceding my_ci_parts.part.

42  
When deleting a multi-datum element the wrong type of header is used
when getting the continuation of the first datum.  It is a
continued-datum-header, not a continued-continuation-header.

41  
Passing a null rel_creation_info_ptr to
relation_manager_$create_relation causes unpredictable results.

39  
The file_manager_ post-transaction action of actual file closing is not
done under the protection of transaction locks.  The call to unlock
locks should come before the call to file_manager_$post_transaction in
the commit/abort process.

38  
When a complex commit is done, uninitialized automatic storage is used
to set the transaction ID in the commit record.  When this unitialized
storage happens to be null, recovery detects too many commit marks
because the finished transaction table built has all transaction IDs
initialized to null.  This leads to a very confusing error entry in the
dms log, about txn 0 having multiple commit or abort marks.

There is a minor problem with the second log message which usually
accompanies the above error:  the last_record_id is reported as zero if
the last record in the BJ was the offending commit mark.

It is not known for sure at this time whether user databases are
actually damaged or not by this behaviour.

37  phx19960
file_manager_$copy does not abide by the delete switch, copy_acl
switch, or any other switch specified in the copy_options structure.

36  phx19837
It is possible to remove the caretaker Daemon's access from a DM file.
This causes the removing process to take faults in the DM ring and
requires a new_proc; it is not possible to set the caretaker's access
back in the faulting process.  This also will cause recovery to fail if
the file has the protected attribute or is a before journal.

35  phx19312
dm_set_free_area was never MCR'd, but is explicitly retained as an
entry into bound_dm_.

34  phx19782
The transaction command's -all and (-tid -tix) selection ctl args are
not diagnosed as incompatible and do not override each other.  This
makes it impossible to use an abbrev or to correct mistakes via
overriding previous specifications.

32  phx19651
The command sequence "create_dm_file filename;txn begin;srb filename 4
5; txn commit" fails in the post-commit handler with the error msg "the
file has been deleted".  A second commit will finish the commit.

31  phx19781
Transaction status with multiple -tix or -tid ctl arg specifications
will only print the last one specified, but N times where N is the
number of specifications used.  The output loop is using the last entry
(tix_count) to index into the array of txn entries instead of the index
of the loop (tix_index).

27  phx19606
If dm_recovery_ signals an error, the Daemon's cl_intermediary will try
to logout the Daemon.  The logout will think the Daemon is using DM,
however, and try to do per-process shutdown.

26  
There is a window in per-process initialization where a user will get
the dm_not_available_ condition, but get a TDT slot anyway.  The
particular case observed was the Daemon just enabling the new DMS and a
user taking over the Daemon's TDT entry (tix = 1).  The user solved the
problem with a new_proc; it is not known if dm_user_shutdown would have
also solved the problem.  See dmsdev [2525], it was a good year.

22  
There are no administrative tools for handling the DM configuration
file (e.g., installing).  If one is installed while the DM Daemon is
booting a DMS, the Daemon will take an error when it tries to unlock
the config file lock; also, another DM Daemon can try to boot a DMS due
to the zeroing of the lock word.

21  
If a FM create or delete rollback/post-commit handler is present, SM
access is needed.  The problem exists because *.SysDaemon is given
access to directories by default, but not *.Daemon.  Also, there is no
way to prevent the user from removing the Daemon's access after the
creation of a file.

20  
If recovery is necessary, there is no check done to verify the current
maximum values in the DM config file are equal to or greater than the
previous DM bootload's values.  This may cause problems if any maximums
are exceeded in the new system (e.g., max.  BJ's less than BJ's left
active).

19  
In some cases, a user can get the error dm_error_$bj_bad_ppte_version
(or similar error).  This is most noticable when doing a txn st -a as
the 1st DM command in the process to cause the fref trap to go off.  It
seems to be caused by the Daemon not clearing the bj_txt after
recovery, and possibly after dead process or abandoned transaction
adjustment.

15  
The file_manager_ and before_journal_manager_ UID-pathname tables may
be useless if a directory in the pathname is renamed.  This occurs
because DMS is not coordiniated with directory control.

14  
No garbage collection is done on the before journal system tables for a
deleted journal.

12  
The transaction counts in the BJ TXTE and BJ PSTE may become out of
sync (but should not happen often).  The count in the PSTE is the true
count.

7  
Overlapping and_groups in a search_specification can cause a key to be
returned multiple times for the same search_spec.

1  
There is a case where a very small element grows and is made a
multi-datum element, only to find there is not enough room in the
original control interval for the continued_datum_header.  Varying-size
Basic ESM elements should have a minimum size large enough to
accomodate a continued_datum_header.
