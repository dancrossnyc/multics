:Info: access_requests.gi: access_requests: 2020-12-22  access_requests

When connecting to Multics, incoming TTY channels are managed by the
Multics answering service, a daemon process run by the site
administrator.  The answering service responds to pre-access and
access requests.


List of pre-access requests:
access_class, acc
   prints the current terminal channel access class on your terminal.
dial, d
   connects an additional terminal to an existing process.  It
   requests the answering service to connect and notifies your process
   of the connection.  For details, type:  help dial
echo
   enable terminal's echoing of typed characters.  Equivalent to:
      modes echoplex
hangup
   terminates communication between the terminal and the Multics
   system.  If the communication is via a dial-up phone line, the line
   is hung up.  If unable to log in, you can issue this request as an
   alternative to manually hanging up the phone.


hello
   repeats the greeting message that is printed whenever a terminal is
   first connected to the system.  It is particularly useful after a
   963 or 029 request since the greeting message is then printed in
   the proper code.
help, HELP
   provides online assistance for logging in by giving examples of
   correct login and the phone number of the system administrator to
   call for more help.  HELP is for use with those terminals whose
   keyboards generate only uppercase characters.
MAP
   tells the system that you are attempting to gain access from a
   terminal whose keyboard generates only uppercase characters.
   For more information, see "Notes on the MAP request".


modes {mode_string}
   sets the terminal modes before login.  Accepts the same mode_string
   as the set_tty -modes control argument.  Without arguments, it
   gives the current modes.  For a list of valid modes, type:
      help tty_modes.gi
noecho
   disable terminal's echoing of typed characters.  Equivalent to:
      modes ^echoplex
slave
   changes the service type of the channel from login to slave for the
   duration of the connection.  For more information, type:
      help slave


terminal_id {STR},
tid {STR}
   sets your terminal identification to STR.  Without arguments it
   gives the current terminal_id.  This command is illegal if your
   site has specified answerback checking.
terminal_type {terminal_type_name},
ttp {terminal_type_name}
   sets the terminal type prior to login.  Without arguments it gives
   the current terminal_type.
029, 963
   tells the system whether you are attempting to gain access from a
   device similar to an EBCDIC (029 typeball) or Correspondence code
   (963 typeball) IBM Model 2741.  For more information, see
   "Notes on 029 and 963 requests".


List of access requests:
   For information on any of these requests, type:  help REQUEST_NAME
enterp, ep,
enter, e
   used by anonymous users to gain access to Multics.  Either one is
   actually a request to the answering service to create a process for
   the anonymous user.
login, l
   gives you access to the system.  It is a request to the answering
   service to start your identification procedure and then either
   create a process for you or connect the terminal to your
   disconnected process.


logout
   signals the finish condition for the process and, after the default
   on unit for the finish condition returns, closes all open files and
   destroys the process.  Using the -hold control argument returns the
   terminal to the pre-access environment; otherwise, logout
   terminates your Multics session and ends communication with the
   Multics system.


Notes on the MAP request:
Once you have issued MAP, the system changes the translation
tables used by the terminal control software so that all uppercase
alphabetic characters are translated to lowercase.  You still need to
use the special escape conventions to represent the ASCII graphics
that are not on the uppercase-only terminal keyboard.  Uppercase
alphabetic characters also require the escape conventions.  (See
"Escape Conventions on Various Terminals" in the Programmer's
Reference Manual, AG91.) After you give the MAP request, you can log
in normally.

Use MAP for 150-, 300-, and 1200-baud terminals if their keyboards can
transmit only uppercase characters; for any other terminal type, it is
ignored.


Notes on the 029 and 963 requests:
If you attempt to log in from a device similar to an EBCDIC or
Correspondence code IBM Model 2741, the system returns a "Type 'help'
for instructions" message accompanied by a partially readable line.
You should respond to this message by typing the specified request.

Once the request has been issued, the system changes the translation
tables used by the terminal control software so that all input/output
is readable.  You can then log in normally.

These requests are valid for 134-baud devices similar to an IBM Model
2741 only; for any other terminal type, they are ignored.


:Info: enterp: enter: ep: e:  1985-03-29  enterp, enter, ep, e

Syntax as a command:
    e {anonymous_name} Project_id {-control_args}
   ep {anonymous_name} Project_id {-control_args}


Function:
The enter pre-access request is used by anonymous users to gain access
to Multics.  Either one is actually a request to the answering service
to create a process for the anonymous user.  Anonymous users who are
not to supply a password use the enter (e) request.  Anonymous users
who are to supply a password use the enterp (ep) request.
See "Notes on passwords" below.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the identification of the project to be accessed.


Control arguments:
-arguments STR, -ag STR
   supplies arguments to the process.  STR can be one or more
   arguments.  All arguments following -ag on the command line are
   taken as arguments to the process.  Therefore -ag, if present, must
   be the last control argument to the enter request.  The process can
   determine the number and value of each argument with the login_args
   active function.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages associated with a successful login.  If the
   standard process overseer is being used, the message of the day is
   not printed.


-force
   logs the user in if at all possible, provided the user has the
   guaranteed login attribute.  Only system users who perform emergency
   repair functions have the necessary attribute.
-home_dir path, -hd path
   sets the user's home directory to the path specified, if the user's
   project administrator allows that user specify a home directory.
-modes STR, -mode STR, -md STR
   sets the I/O modes associated with the user's terminal to STR, where
   the string STR consists of modes acceptable to the tty_ I/O module.
   (See the tty_ I/O module description in the Subroutines manual for a
   complete explanation of possible modes.)  The STR string is usually
   a list of modes separated by commas; the STR string must not contain
   blanks.


-no_preempt, -np
   refuses to log the user in if login can be achieved only by
   preempting some other user in the load control group.
-no_print_off, -npf
   causes the system to overtype a string of characters to provide a
   black area for typing the password.
-no_start_up, -ns
   instructs the standard process overseer not to execute the user's
   start_up.ec segment, if one exists, and if the project administrator
   allows the user to avoid it.


-no_warning, -nw
   suppresses even urgent system warning and emergency messages from
   the operator, both at login and during the user's session.  Use of
   this argument is recommended only for users who are using a remote
   computer to simulate a terminal, or are typing out long memoranda,
   when the process output should not be interrupted by even the most
   serious messages.
-outer_module p, -om p
   attaches the user's terminal via the outer module named p rather
   than the user's registered outer module, if the user has the
   privilege of specifying an outer module.
-print_off, -pf
   suppresses overtyping for the password.  (Default: determined by the
   terminal type)


-process_overseer path, -po path
   sets the user's process overseer to the procedure given by the path
   specified, if the user's project administrator allows that user to
   specify a process overseer.  If path ends in the characters
   ",direct", the specified procedure is called directly during process
   initialization rather than by the init_admin procedure provided by
   the system.  This means that the program specified by path must
   perform the tasks that would have been performed by the init_admin
   procedure.
-ring N, -rg N
   sets the user's initial ring to be ring N, if this ring number is
   greater than or equal to the user's registered initial ring and less
   than the user's registered maximum ring.


-subsystem path, -ss path
   creates the user's process using the prelinked subsystem in the
   directory specified by path.  The permission to specify a process
   overseer, which can be given by the user's project administrator,
   also governs the use of the -subsystem argument.  To override a
   default subsystem by the project administrator, type -ss "".
-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   sets the user's terminal type to STR, where STR is any terminal type
   name defined in the standard terminal type table.  (To obtain a list
   of terminal types, refer to the print_terminal_types command.)  This
   control argument overrides the default terminal type.


Notes: If neither the -print_off nor -no_print_off control argument is
specified at log-in, the system attempts to choose the option most
appropriate for the user's terminal type.

If the project administrator does not allow the user to specify the
-subsystem, -outer_module, -home_dir, -process_overseer, or -ring
control arguments or if the administrator does allow one or more of
these control arguments and they are incorrectly specified by the user,
a message is printed and the login is refused.


Notes on passwords: The password is a string of one to eight
characters.  The characters can be any printing character from the
ASCII character set except space and semi-colon.  The backspace
character is also allowed and is counted as a character.  The password
used for interactive logins cannot be "quit", "help", "HELP", or "?",
because these have special meaning to the password processor.  Typing a
password of "quit" terminates the login attempt.  A response of "help",
"HELP", or "?"  produces an explanatory message, and the request for
the password is repeated.


:Info: login: l:  2020-04-22  login, l

Syntax as a command:  l Person_id{.Project_id} {-control_args}


Function:
The login pre-access request gives a user access to the system.  It is
a request to the answering service to start the user identification
procedure and then either create a process for you, or connect the
terminal to your disconnected process.  The command line can be up to
300 characters long.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is your registered personal identifier, which can be replaced by a
   registered "login alias" if you have one.
Project_id
   is the identification of your project.  If you don't give it, the
   default project associated with the Person_id is used.  (See
   -change_default_project.)


Control arguments:
   The following are permitted in any use of the login command.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages associated with a successful login except the
   ones indicating that you have incorrectly specified your password
   and the ones indicating all your login attempts with the same
   Person_id.  If you are using the standard process overseer, the
   message of the day is not printed.
-change_default_auth, -cda
   changes your registered default login authorization to the one
   specified by -authorization.  If you give a valid authorization, the
   default authorization is changed for subsequent logins and the
   message "default authorization changed" is printed.  If you give
   -cda without -authorization, an error message is printed.


-change_default_project, -cdp
   changes your default project to the Project_id specified on this
   login request line.  The default Project_id is changed for
   subsequent logins, and the message "default project changed" is
   printed.  If you specify -cdp without a Project_id, an error message
   is printed.
-change_password, -cpw
   changes your password to a new one.  The login request asks for the
   old password before it requests the new one, twice, to verify the
   spelling.  If you don't type it the same way both times, the login
   and the password change are refused.  If the old password is
   correct, the new one replaces the old for subsequent logins and the
   message "password changed" is printed.  Don't type the new password
   as part of the control argument.  (See "Notes on Passwords" below.)


-generate_password, -gpw
   changes your password to a new one, generated for you by the system.
   The login request asks for the old password first; then, a new
   password is generated and typed on your terminal.  You are asked to
   retype the new password, to verify having seen it.  If you type it
   correctly, it replaces the old for subsequent logins and the message
   "password changed" is printed.  If you mistype it, the login and
   password change are refused.
-long, -lg
   reverses the effect of -brief, or the brief attribute in the project
   definition table (see the MAM Project, AK51).


-modes STR, -mode STR, -md STR
   sets the I/O modes associated with your terminal to STR, where STR
   consists of modes acceptable to the tty_ I/O module (see the set_tty
   command).  STR is usually a list of modes separated by commas; it
   must not contain blanks.  (See "Examples.")
-no_print_off, -npf
   overtypes a string of characters to provide a black area for you to
   type the password.
-no_warning, -nw
   suppresses even urgent system warning messages and emergency
   messages from the operator, both at login and during your session.
   Give this argument when using a remote computer to simulate a
   terminal or when typing out long memoranda, when the process output
   should not be interrupted by even serious messages.


-print_off, -pf
   suppresses overtyping for the password.  (Default:  depends on the
   terminal type)
-terminal_id STR, -tid STR
   sets your terminal identification to STR.  This control argument is
   illegal if the site has specified answerback checking.
-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   sets your terminal type to STR, where STR is any terminal type name
   defined in the standard terminal type table.  This control argument
   overrides the default terminal type.
-warning
   reverses the effect of -no_warning, or the no_warning attribute in
   the project definition table (see the MAM Project, AK51).


Control arguments for process creation:
   Use the following when requesting the creation of a new process.
-arguments STR, -ag STR
   supplies arguments to the process; STR can be one or more arguments.
   If you use -arguments, put it last because everything following it
   on the command line is taken as arguments to the process.  The
   process can determine the number and value of each argument with the
   login_args active function.


-authorization STR, -auth STR
   sets the authorization of the process to that specified by STR; STR
   is a character string composed of level and category names for the
   desired authorization, separated by commas.  STR cannot contain any
   embedded blank or tab characters.  (The short names for each level
   and category always contain no blanks or tabs, and can be used
   whenever the corresponding long names contain blanks or tabs.)  STR
   must represent an authorization that is less than or equal to the
   maximum authorization of Person_id on the Project_id.  If
   -authorization is omitted, your registered default login
   authorization is used.  (See the Programmer's Reference Manual for
   more information about process authorizations.)


-force
   logs you in, provided you have the guaranteed login attribute.  Only
   system users who perform emergency repair functions have the
   necessary attribute.
-home_dir path, -hd path
   sets your home directory to the path specified if your project
   administrator allows it.
-no_save_on_disconnect, -nosave
   logs your process out instead of saving it if it is disconnected
   from its login terminal.  This control argument is used to override
   a default of -save if that default has been set by your project
   administrator.
-no_preempt, -np
   does not log you in if you might preempt somebody in this user's
   load control group.


-no_start_up, -ns
   instructs the standard process overseer not to execute your
   start_up.ec segment if the project administrator allows it.
-outer_module path, -om path
   attaches your terminal via the outer module named path rather than
   your registered outer module if you are allowed.
-process_overseer path, -po path
   sets your process overseer to the procedure given by path if your
   project administrator allows it.  If path ends in the characters
   ",direct", the specified procedure is called directly during process
   initialization rather than by the standard system-provided
   procedure.  This means that the program used by path must perform
   the tasks that would have been performed by the standard procedure.
   The combined length of the -po and -ss character strings must be
   less than 64 characters.


-ring N, -rg N
   sets your initial ring to N if this ring number is greater than or
   equal to your registered initial ring and less than your registered
   maximum ring.
-save_on_disconnect, -save
   saves your process if it is disconnected from its login terminal
   because of a communications line hangup or FNP crash.  Your project
   administrator gives permission to use the process-saving facility
   and to enable it by default.  (See -nosave and the
   save_on_disconnect and no_save_on_disconnect commands.)
-subsystem path, -ss path
   creates your process using the prelinked subsystem in the directory
   specified by path if your project administrator allows it.  To
   override a default subsystem specified by the project administrator,
   type -ss "".


Control arguments for disconnected processes:
   Use the following to specify the disposition of disconnected
   processes (see "Notes on Disconnected Processes" below).
-connect {N}
   connects the terminal to your disconnected process.  If more than
   one such process exists, indicate the process number N.
-create
   creates a new process without destroying any disconnected ones.
   This is permitted only if you are allowed to have multiple
   interactive processes.
-destroy {N}
   destroys your disconnected process and logs out.  If more than one
   such process exists, specify the process number N.


-immediate
   bypasses termination of the existing process by the trm_ IPS signal
   (which causes running of finish and epilogue handlers in the
   existing process) and instead tells the hardcore to destroy the
   existing process immediately.
-list
   lists your disconnected process, its number, the time of the
   original login, and the ID of the channel and terminal that were
   last connected to the process.
-new_proc {N}
   destroys your disconnected process and creates a new one.  If more
   than one such process exists, give the process number N.


Notes:  Unless you already have one or more processes, login creates a
process for you.  The load control mechanism is consulted to determine
if the creation of your process overloads either the system or your
load control group.


If the mechanism allows it, a process is created for you and the
terminal is connected to it (i.e., the terminal is placed under that
process's control).  (See "List of Control Arguments for Process
Creation" above.)


You might have a disconnected process because of a phone line hangup or
an FNP crash.  Then, you can choose among the following alternatives:
connecting the terminal to the process; destroying the disconnected
process, with or without creating a new one; or logging out without
affecting the disconnected process (see "List of Control Arguments for
Disconnected Processes" above and "Notes on Disconnected Processes"
below).


If you specify neither -pf nor -npf at log-in, the system chooses the
option most appropriate for your terminal type.


Several parameters of your process, as noted above, can be controlled
by your project administrator; for example, allowing you to override
attributes by specifying control arguments on the login line.


If the project administrator does not allow you to use -hd -om, -po,
-rg, -save, or -ss or does allow you to give one or more of them and
you specify them incorrectly, a message is printed and the login is
refused.


Notes on passwords:  The login request asks you for a password and
ensures either that the password does not appear on your terminal or
that it is thoroughly hidden in a string of cover-up characters.  The
password is a string of one to eight characters, which can be any
character from the ASCII character set (including the backspace) except
space and semicolon.  The password used for interactive logins cannot
be "quit", "help", "HELP", or "?"  because these have special meaning
to the password processor.  Typing "quit" terminates the login attempt;
"help", "HELP", or "?"  produces an explanatory message and repeats the
request for the password.


After you type the password the answering service looks up the
Person_id, the Project_id, and the password in its tables and verifies
that the Person_id and the Project_id are valid, that you are a legal
user of the project, and that the password given matches the registered
password.  If these tests succeed, you are logged in.


Notes on disconnected processes:  If your project administrator allows
it, your process can be preserved when it becomes disconnected from its
terminal.  You can call back any time before the installation-defined
maximum inactive time and ask to be reconnected.  This feature is
controlled by -save and -nosave; your project administrator sets the
default.


If your project administrator allows you to have several interactive
processes simultaneously, you can have more than one disconnected
process.  Multiple disconnected processes are numbered consecutively
starting with 1, in the order of their login times.  Use these process
numbers as arguments when referring to one of a set of multiple
disconnected processes.  The number and login time of each is printed
by -list or the "list" request.  You can, however, anticipate the
number and use it with a control argument.  The time listed and sorted
on is the time of the original login from which the process is
descended; this time is not affected by new_proc or reconnection.


List of requests for disconnected processes:
   If you do not specify on the login line what to do with the
   disconnected processes, you are told of the disconnected processes.
   Select one of the following requests.
connect {N}
   connect the terminal to a disconnected process.
create
   create an additional process.
destroy {N} {-control_args}
   destroy a disconnected process and log out.
help
   print a description of these requests.
list
   list your disconnected processes.


logout {-control_args}
   log out without affecting any process.
new_proc {N} {-control_args}
   destroy a disconnected process, create a new one with the same
   attributes, and connect the terminal to it.


Control arguments (disconnected process requests):
-hold, -hd
   prevents the breaking of the connection between the terminal and the
   answering service.  You can use it only with destroy and logout.
   (Default)
-immediate
   bypasses termination of the existing process by the trm_ IPS signal
   (which causes running of finish and epilogue handlers in the
   existing process) and instead tells the hardcore to destroy the
   existing process immediately.  You can use it only with destroy and
   new_proc.
-no_hold, -nhd
   drops the connection.  You can use it only with destroy and logout.


:Info: logout:  1985-02-15  logout

Syntax as a command:  logout {-control_args}


Function: terminates your session and ends communication with the
Multics system.  It signals the finish condition for the process and,
after the default on unit for the finish condition returns, closes all
open files and destroys the process.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints neither the logout message nor, if you give -hold, the login
   message.
-hold, -hd
   terminates your session but not communication with the system: you
   can immediately log in without redialing.


Notes: If your site is security conscious, it may have disabled
"logout -hold"; in this case if you wish to change authorization, do
this:
   1. log out
   2. verify, using terminal/modem indications, that the terminal has
      dropped DTR and that the system acknowledged by dropping DSR
   3. log in at the new authorization.


This procedure is the only way to guarantee that you are communicating
with the answering service and not with a Trojan horse.

DTR and DSR are EIA RS232 control signals that are part of the
interface between your terminal and the system.


:Info: dial: d: 1987-07-20  dial, d

Syntax as a command:  d dial_id {User_id} {-control_args}


Function:
The dial pre-access request connects an additional terminal to an
existing process.  It requests the answering service to connect, then
notifies the existing process of the new connection.


Arguments:
dial_id
   is the identifying keyword, supplied by a logged-in process, that
   uniquely specifies that process that is accepting dial connections.
User_id
   is the Person_id.Project_id of the process that you wish to connect
   to.  This argument is required only if the dial_id is not registered
   with the system.  A registered alias can be given for the Person_id
   and Project_id.


Control arguments:
-authorization ACCESS_CLASS, -auth ACCESS_CLASS
   specifies the AIM level and category, or categories, of the data
   that will be transmitted to and from the system in this session.  If
   you don't provide it, the default authorization from the PNT is
   used.  You can only supply it with -user.
-no_print_off, -npf
   overtypes a string of characters providing a black area for you to
   type the password.  You can only give it with -user.  (Default:
   depends on the terminal type)


-print_off, -pf
   tells the system that the terminal can stop printing while a
   password is being entered.  No password mask is printed.
-user Own_person_id, -user Own_user_id
   specifies a User_id to give when validating access to the
   communications channel.  Own_person_id is your registered personal
   identifier; Own_user_id is your Person_id.Project_id.  If you supply
   no Project_id, the default project associated with the Own_person_id
   is used.  A registered alias can be given for the Person_id and
   Project_id.


Notes: When you invoke dial, the answering service searches for a
logged-in process accepting dial connections using the dial_id you
provided.  If not found, the message "Dial line not active."  is
printed and you can try again, with a different dial_id; if found, a
one-line message verifying the connection is printed.  All further
messages printed on the terminal are from your process.

This request is administratively restricted.  The project administrator
must register you and your project if you want dialed terminals.  The
system administrator must register the dial_id if you want dialed
terminals without Own_user_id and can restrict your access to a login
service communications channel.  Give -user with your User_id.  This
request then asks for your password ensuring its nonvisibility.  When
your identification and permission to use the channel are verified the
dial request is processed.


All arguments must be supplied in the correct order.

If your process terminates or logs out, a message is printed and
control of the terminal is returned to the answering service.


:Info: slave:  1984-09-27  slave

Syntax as a command:  slave {-control_args}


Function:
The slave pre-access request changes the service type of the channel
from login to slave for the duration of the connection.


Control arguments:
-authorization ACCESS_CLASS, -auth ACCESS_CLASS
   specifies the AIM level and category, or categories, of the data
   that will be transmitted to and from the system in this session.  If
   you don't provide it, the default authorization from the PNT is
   used.  You can only supply it with -user.
-no_print_off, -npf
   overtypes a string of characters providing a black area for you to
   type the password.  You can only give it with -user.  (Default:
   depends on the terminal type)


-print_off, -pf
   suppresses the overtyping of the password.  You can only provide it
   with -user.  (Default: depends on the terminal type)
-user Own_person_id, -user Own_user_id
   specifies a User_id to give when validating access to the
   communications channel.  Own_person_id is your registered personal
   identifier; Own_user_id is your Person_id.Project_id.  If you supply
   no Project_id, the default project associated with the Own_person_id
   is used.


Notes: The slave command enables a privileged process to request the
answering service to assign the channel to it, and then attach it (see
the dial_manager_ subroutine for an explanation of the mechanism for
requesting channels from the answering service).

This request is administratively restricted.  The project administrator
must register you and your project if you want dialed terminals.  The
system administrator must register the dial_id if you want dialed
terminals without Own_user_id and can restrict your access to a login
service communications channel.  Give -user with your User_id.  This
request then asks for your password ensuring its nonvisibility.  When
your identification and permission to use the channel are verified the
dial request is processed.

     audit(2021-05-27,Swenson), install(2021-05-27,MR12.6g-0056):
      A) Replace the existing files: dial.info, enter.info, login.info,
            logout.info, terminal_id.info, terminal_type.info
         with a new file called access_requests.gi.info.
         By putting all this information in one file, a user can print or dprint this
         file to get a quick-reference card on logging in and out of Multics.
      B) Add a note on logout description indicating that it returns the
         terminal to the pre-access environment (if -hold is given).
      C) Overruled verify_info errors relating to:
          - capitalization of words in section titles:
              "Notes on the MAP request"
          - order of section titles:
              "Control arguments (disconnected process requests)"
         MAP is an all-CAPs pre-access request for terminals that cannot
         enter lowercase letters.  The Control arguments section title
         applies to Notes section just prior to it.
                                                   END HISTORY COMMENTS */
