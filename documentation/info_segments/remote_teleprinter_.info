03/31/83  remote_teleprinter_


Function: The remote_teleprinter_ I/O module presents a stream I/O
interface to the caller and performs record I/O to a terminal or
printer, which is assumed to be part of a remote I/O device, such as a
Honeywell Level 6 remote batch facility (G115 type), an IBM 2780, or
an IBM 3780.

Entry points in this module are not called directly by users; rather,
the module is accessed through the I/O system.

This module in turn constructs an attach description for the module
specified in the -terminal control argument, passing the attach
information for ASCII or EBCDIC, horizontal tabbing, physical line
length, and all other attach information specified by the caller.


Syntax and Attach Description:
     remote_teleprinter_ -control_args


Control arguments:
   The following control arguments are optional, with the exception of
-terminal:
-horizontal_tab, -htab
   output device has a horizontal tab feature.  The default is no tab
   control.
-physical_line_length N, -pll N
   output device has a maximum line width of N characters.  The default
   is 80 characters.
-physical_page_length N, -ppl N
   output device has a maximum line count per page of N.  The default
   is 66 lines.
-runout_spacing N, -runsp N
   outputs N newline characters with each runout operation.  This
   allows the operator to see messages still under the printer
   mechanism for terminals that have only a printer as an output
   device.  The default is 0.
-terminal STR
   uses the terminal I/O module specified by STR.  This control_arg is
   required.


List of Open Operations:
   The remote_teleprinter_ I/O module supports the stream_input_output
   opening mode.


Put Chars Operation:
The put_chars entry converts a character string ending in a newline
character to an image suitable for printing and transmits this image to
the terminal I/O module.


Get Chars Operation:
The get_chars entry reads the number of specified characters from the
terminal I/O module.


Get Line Operation:
The get_line entry reads one record from the terminal I/O module,
appends a new line, and returns as many characters as requested by the
caller, or the whole record if it is shorter.  If the record is longer
than requested, error_table_$data_loss is returned.


Control Operation:
This I/O module supports all the control operations supported by the
terminal I/O module specified in the attach description.  In addition,
it supports all the control operations supported by the I/O module
remote_printer_.


Modes Operation:
This I/O module supports all the modes supported by the terminal I/O
module specified in the attach description.  In addition, it supports
all the modes supported by the I/O module remote_ printer_.


Position Operation:
This I/O module supports all the position operations supported by the
terminal I/O module specified in the attach description.
