2019-05-25  Errata for Standards Manual

Function: This info segment provides errata and addenda information
for the Multics manual AN82-00 titled:

            STANDARDS
	  SYSTEM DESIGN'S NOTEBOOK


2019-05-25  Information for MR 12.7:

pg 11-2 under "SYNTAX OF INFO SEGMENTS"
     Replace the "Title" paragraph with the following:

     Title

          Some rules  apply to all  three types of info segments.  The
     first line in each info segment (or entrypoint description within
     a subroutine info segment) must be a brief  title line, beginning
     with  the date of the  last  modification.  The  title should  be
     appropriate for a table of  contents; for command  or  subroutine
     descriptions it will give  the name(s)  of the  program including
     abbreviations.  The date should be in iso_date format.

          Examples of title lines:

      	       2019-05-24  AN82 Errata for Standards Manual
      	       1985-10-10  validate_info_seg, vis

      	       1985-09-23  ioa_
                  ...
      	       :Entry: ioa_: nnl:  1981-09-19  ioa_, ioa_$nnl

     The last example above shows titles for a subroutine with several
     entrypoints.  The first title line uses the standard title format
     for the  introductory section of  the info segment;  this section
     describes  the  purpose and  common  characteristics  of all  the
     subroutine's  entrypoints.   Subsequent  sections  describe  each
     entrypoint  or  group of  entrypoints  sharing  a common  calling
     sequence.  Each section begins with  an :Entry: title line naming
     the entrypoint(s) followed by a  typical title line with iso_date
     and the full  subroutine name(s) described by  that section.  The
     :Entry: and colon-separated names allow  the help command to skip
     to the  description of  a particular  entrypoint, and  to produce
     output for its list_entry_points request.
