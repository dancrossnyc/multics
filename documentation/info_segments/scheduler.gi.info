:Info: scheduler.gi: 02/26/82 scheduler

     The module in the system that determines when a process is to run
and how long it will run.  It also notifies processes of events that
have occurred such as timers, I/O events, and signals from other
processes.


:Info: search_rules.gi: 02/26/82 search rules

     A list of directories that are searched to find a command,
subroutine, or data item referenced symbolically.  Each directory is
examined, in order, to find the given external name.  Search rules are
not used when a segment is addressed by its pathname, which explicitly
specifies the directory containing the segment.


:Info: segment.gi: 02/26/82 segment

     Basic unit of information within the Multics storage system.
Each segment has access attributes, at least one name, and may contain
data, programs, or be empty (null).


:Info: short_name.gi: 03/05/82 short name

     The shortened version of a command or control argument name, used
interchangeably with the full name.  The short names are listed in
individual command descriptions.


:Info: shriek_name.gi: 02/26/82 shriek name

     A name, generated from a system clock value, that is guaranteed
to be different from any other name so generated (e.g.,
!BBBnZNlqLQddRJg).  See the description of the unique command.


:Info: snap.gi: 02/26/82 snap (to snap a link)

     The process of finding that segment (and entry point in the
segment) that is referenced by a link pair and replacing the link pair
with a pointer to that entry point.  This is part of the dynamic
linking mechanism, by which external symbolic references (subroutine
calls, PL/I external variables) are resolved while the program is
running.


:Info: source_segment.gi: 03/05/82 source segment

     A program that exists on line in language form.  It must be
converted to an object segment by compilation before it can be
executed.


:Info: standard_service_system.gi: sss.gi: SSS.gi: 02/26/82 standard_system_service (SSS)

     A group of commands and subroutines that are provided as part of
the standard Multics system.  They are located in the directories
>system_library_standard, >system_library_unbundled, and
>system_library_1.


:Info: stack.gi: 02/26/82 stack

     A pushdown list where active procedures maintain private regions
used for temporary variables and interprocedure communication.


:Info: status_code.gi: 02/26/82 status code

     A value returned by a subroutine indicating either the success of
or the reason for failure to accomplish the requested action.
Associated with standard system error codes are certain predefined
messages that tell what happened.


:Info: storage_system.gi: 03/05/82 storage system

     The combination of hardware and software that Multics uses for
storing information.  The information is grouped into segments and
catalogued in directories.  See also directory_hierarchy.info.


:Info: subsystem.gi: 02/26/82 subsystem

     A collection of programs that provide a special environment for
some particular purpose, such as editing, calculation, or data
management.  It may perform its own command processing, file handling,
and accounting.  A subsystem is said to be closed if:

     1.  all necessary operations can be handled within the
         subsystem

     2.  no way exists to use the normal Multics environment from
         within the subsystem


:Info: switch.gi: 02/26/82 switch

     A path in the I/O system through which information is sent.  (See
attach and detach.)


:Info: SysDaemon.gi: sysdaemon.gi: 02/26/82 SysDaemon

     One of several system service processes that perform such tasks
as process creation, backup, network control, and printing segments on
the line printer.


:Info: system_administrator.gi: 02/26/82 system administrator

     A person who has the access to register users, create projects,
perform accounting runs, and perform other functions necessary for the
administration of the system.


:Info: system_control_dir.gi: sc1.gi: system_control_1.gi: 02/26/82 system_control_dir (sc1, system_control_1)

     The directory that contains those segments and directories used
to control the operation of the system including the answer table, who
table, person name table, project PDTs, etc.
