:Entry: find_condition_info_: 08/20/81 find_condition_info_

Function: given a pointer to a stack frame being used when a signal
occurred, returns information relevant to that condition.


Syntax:
declare find_condition_info_ entry (ptr, ptr, fixed bin(35));
call find_condition_info_ (stack_ptr, condition_info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
stack_ptr
   is a pointer to a stack frame being used when a condition occurred.
   (Input) It is normally the result of a call to
   find_condition_frame_; if null, the most recent condition frame is
   used.
condition_info_ptr
   is a pointer to the structure (see "Notes" below) in which
   information is returned.  (Input)
code
   is the standard status code.  (Output) It is nonzero when the
   stack_ptr argument does not point to a condition frame or, if the
   stack_ptr argument is null, when no condition frame can be found.


Notes:  The structure that condition_info_ptr points to is declared in
the include file condition_info.incl.pl1.
