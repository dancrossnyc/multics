12/14/80  dot_tab.compin

Syntax:  .ifi dot_tab "table-title"


Function:
This compose macro
1) increments the table "dot number" counter
2) outputs a centered, perhaps multiline table heading above the table
   with appropriate spacing between table and heading
3) adds the 'table-title' to the list of Tables in the Table of
   Contents if the creation of such a list has been enabled (see
   tab_on.compin.info)


Arguments:
'table-title' is the title of the table, as it is to appear in the list
   of Tables in the Table of Contents (initial caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The table "dot number" counter is maintained on a per-section basis
   for documents done in sections (those in which the 'section'
   variable has been set), and on a per-document basis for all other
   documents.
2) After the dot_tab macro is used, the 'table' compose variable
   contains the table number of the current table.  'table' will be of
   the form '<section>-<last_tab_No>.N' if the 'section' variable has
   been set.  'table' can be used in the text to refer to the current
   table.  (See dot_tab_get_no.compin.info and tab_get_no.compin.info
   for references to a table other than the current table.)
3) The dot_tab macro cannot be used without an existing <last_tab_no>,
   that is, it must follow some use of the tab or tab_index macros.
   The next use of the tab, tab_index, or tab_get_no macro resets the
   tabe "dot number" counter back to zero.
4) See dot_tab_index.compin.info, tab_index.compin.info,
   dot_tab_get_no.compin.info, tab_get_no.compin.info, and
   tab_on.compin.info for related information.


Examples:
To add a Figure after Figure 3-3 of a document...
     .ifi dot_tab "Added Table"
resulting in...

                       Table 3-3.1.  Added Table
