:Info: dm_fast_lock_meters:  1985-03-26  dm_fast_lock_meters

Syntax as a command:  dm_fast_lock_meters {-control_args}


Function: This command displays metering information about Data
Management fast locking.


Control arguments:
-reset, -rs
   resets the meters to zero and suppresses reporting.
-report_reset, -rr
   reports the current meters then resets them.


Notes:  Data Management fast locking maintains a list of blocks where
a block can contain information on the fast lock or on the waiter of a
fast lock.  Adding a block to this list is considered threading in,
and removing a block is considered threading out.  It is possible that
an attempt is being made to thread a block in or out and another
process changes the list first.  In this case the attempt must be
retried; each attempt is called a step.


Examples:
!  dm_fast_lock_meters

  Total metering time:  4:19:51

  Fast lock or waiter block:
  thread in calls / steps     thread out calls / steps
               10      12                    9       9
