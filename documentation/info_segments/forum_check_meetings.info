:Info: forum_check_meetings: fckm:  1986-08-07  forum_check_meetings, fckm

Syntax as a command:  fckm {meeting_names} {-control_args}


Function:
establishes a list of changed meetings which can then be successively
visited by the next_meeting (nm) request within the forum subsystem.


Arguments:
meeting_names
   are names of meetings to be checked. The star convention is allowed.
   If meeting_names are given, the list of changed meetings will
   consist of any changed meetings in the list given. If no
   meeting_names are given, then the list consists of all changed
   meetings which may be found in the "forum" search list.


Control arguments:
-exclude meeting_names, -ex meeting_names
   excludes the meetings identified by meeting_names from the changed
   meeting list.
-from DT, -fm DT
   selects meetings which have changed since the specified time.  DT is
   any string acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.
   The default is the current time.
-list, -ls
   prints the name of each changed meeting and the number of new
   transactions in each.


Notes:
The list of changed meetings is accessible to applications outside
of the forum subsystem.  The external variable forum_data_$meeting_list
points to the following structure, which is defined in the include file
forum_meeting_list.incl.pl1:


dcl 1 forums_array aligned,
    2 version char (8),
    2 no_selected fixed bin,
    2 no_changed fixed bin,
    2 forums (0 refer (forums_array.no_selected)),
      3 long_name char (26) unaligned,
      3 short_name char (26) unaligned,
      3 path_name char (168) unaligned,
      3 chairman char (32) unaligned,
      3 uid bit (36) aligned,
      3 count fixed bin,
      3 last_seen fixed bin,
      3 last_trans fixed bin,


      3 flags unaligned,
        4 eligible bit (1),
        4 removed bit (1),
        4 notify bit (1),
        4 attending bit (1),
        4 two_names bit (1),
        4 read_only bit (1),
        4 attended bit (1),
        4 adjourned bit (1),
        4 processed bit (1),
        4 mbz bit (27),
      3 order fixed bin;


where
version
   is set to forum_meeting_list_version_1.
no_selected
   is the number of meetings in the array.
no_changed
   is the number of changed meetings in the list.
long_name
   is the primary name of the meeting.
short_name
   is an additional name of the meeting.  Valid only if the two_names
   flag is set.
path_name
   is the full pathname of the meeting.


chairman
   is the user_id, as User.Project, of the meeting's chairman.
uid
   is the storage system unique identifier of the meeting.
count
   is the number of new transactions in the meeting.
last_seen
   is the index of the most recent transaction that this user has
   seen in this meeting.
last_trans
   is the index of the last transaction in the meeting.
eligible
   is set if the user is eligible to attend the meeting.


removed
   is set if the user or chairman has turned off the participating
   switch for this meeting.
notify
   is set if the user's notify switch is on for this meeting.
attending
   is set if the user was attending the meeting when the command
   was executed.
two_names
   is set when the short_name field is valid.
read_only
   is set if the user does not have access to  enter transactions in
   the meeting.


attended
   is set if the user has ever attended the meeting.
adjourned
   is set if the meeting is adjourned.
processed
   is set if the next_meeting command has already visited this
   meeting.  See "Notes on structure" below.
mbz
   is always set to ""b.
order
   is an array which orders the meetings alphabetically.  See
   "Notes on structure" below.


Notes on structure:

The array contains information about 'no_selected' meetings.  The
'order' array contains sorting information (alphabetical order by short
name) that can be used in the following way:

   do idx = 1 to forums_array.no_selected;
      process (forums_array.forums (forums_array.forums(idx).order));
   end;

where process is the name of a procedure that uses the information
about a single meeting.   This procedure should set the 'processed'
flag to indicate that this entry has been used.  The forum
'next_meeting' request obeys this protocol.
