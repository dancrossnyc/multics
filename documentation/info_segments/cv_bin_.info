:Entry: cv_bin_: 02/06/84  cv_bin_

Function:  converts the binary representation of an integer
(of any base) to a 12-character ASCII string.


Syntax:
declare cv_bin_ entry (fixed bin, char(12) aligned, fixed bin);
call cv_bin_ (n, string, base);


Arguments:
n
   is the binary integer to be converted.  (Input)
string
   is the ASCII equivalent of n.  (Output)
base
   is the base to use in converting the binary integer (e.g., base is
   10 for decimal integers).  (Input)


:Entry:  dec:  02/06/84 cv_bin_$dec


Function: converts the binary representation of an integer of base 10
to a 12-character ASCII string.


Syntax:
declare cv_bin_$dec entry (fixed bin, char(12) aligned);
call cv_bin_$dec (n, string);


Arguments:
n
   is the binary integer to be converted.  (Input)
string
   is the ASCII equivalent of n.  (Output)


Notes:  This function can be performed more efficiently in PL/I by:

      string = ltrim (char (n));



:Entry:  oct:  02/06/84 cv_bin_$oct


Function: converts the binary representation of an octal integer to a
12-character ASCII string.


Syntax:
declare cv_bin_$oct entry (fixed bin, char(12) aligned);
call cv_bin_$oct (n, string);


Arguments:
n
   is the binary integer to be converted.  (Input)
string
   is the ASCII equivalent of n.  (Output)


Notes:  If the character-string representation of the number exceeds 12
characters, then only the low-order 12 digits are returned.
