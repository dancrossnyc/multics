02/15/85  micro_transfer, mt

Syntax as a command:  mt path {-control_args}


Function: transfers files between a Multics system and a remote
microcomputer (personal computer) using either 1) the xmodem protocol
or 2) the IBM PC-to-Host protocol.  Your terminal must be connected to
the system through the tty_ I/O module.  (This is the usual method of
connecting terminal to the Multics system.)


Arguments:
path
   can be one of the following:
      1) is the pathname of the source segment on Multics when
      transferring files from Multics to a microcomputer.
      2) is the pathname of the target segment on Multics when
      transferring files to Multics from a microcomputer.


Control arguments:
-attach_description STR, -atd STR
   specifies the I/O module to be used to implement the file transfer,
   where STR specifies the I/O module to be used and the I/O switch to
   which the module is to be attached.  Enclose STR in quotation marks
   if it contains spaces or other command language characters.  STR can
   be one of the following:
   xmodem_io_ user_i/o
      specifies the XMODEM protocol is to be used.  (Default)
   ibm_pc_io_ user_i/o
      specifies the IBM PC-to_Host protocol is to be used.


-eof STR
   specifies the end-of-file sequence for the microcomputer, where STR
   is the end-of-file character.  STR can be a printable ASCII
   character or a control character; you must express the latter type
   in the octal equivalent and surround it by quotation marks.  When
   transmitting a file to a microcomputer the end-of-file character is
   transmitted as STR; when receiving a file from a microcomputer the
   occurrence of STR indicates the end-of-file to Multics.


-eol STR
   specifies the end-of-line sequence for the microcomputer, where STR
   is the end-of-line character.  STR can be a printable ASCII
   character or a control character; you must express the latter type
   in the octal equivalent and surround it by quotation marks.  When
   transmitting files to a microcomputer, each linefeed character is
   translated to STR; when receiving files from a microcomputer, each
   occurrence of STR is translated to a linefeed character.
-modes STR
   sets the modes for file transfer according to STR, which is a string
   of mode names separated by commas.  You can optionally precede many
   modes by ^ to turn the specified mode off.  Modes not specified in
   STR are left unchanged.  Modes are restored to their original value
   after the file transfer is complete.  (See set_tty for a list of
   valid modes; see "Data transfer i/o modules" for the default modes.)


-receive
   receives data from the microcomputer.  Give either -receive or
   -send.
-send
   sends data to the microcomputer.


Notes on data transfer i/o modules: The micro_transfer command
provides an interface between the Multics file system and a data
transfer protocol.  The data transfer protocol is implemented as an I/O
module.  Such I/O modules must specify a target I/O switch, and they
must support the stream_input and stream_output opening modes.  The
switch identified by the switch argument must be open for
stream_input_output.  The following I/O modules are currently available
for use with micro_transfer:
xmodem_io_
   uses the XMODEM data transfer protocol.  The default mode string
   used by micro_transfer for file transfer is:
   "no_outp,8bit,breakall,^echoplex,rawi,^crecho,^lfecho,^tabecho,rawo"


ibm_pc_io_
   uses the IBM PC-to-Host data transfer protocol.  This protocol does
   not transfer binary data or check for errors.  The default mode
   string used by micro_transfer for file transfer is:
   "^8bit,breakall,^echoplex,rawi,^crecho,^lfecho,^tabecho,rawo"

Users writing their own data transfer protocol I/O modules with
micro_transfer may do so.  Its descriptions would be:
XXX
   uses the user-specified data transfer protocol for the file
   transfer.  The default mode string used by micro_transfer for file
   transfer is:
   "no_outp,8bit,breakall,^echoplex,rawi,^crecho,^lfecho,^tabecho,rawo"


Notes on file transfer speed: There is no guarantee of any particular
line speed when transferring files between Multics and a microcomputer.
Line speed is dependent on the microcomputer and the load of the FNP
and communication system for Multics.  Due to the nature of the XMODEM
and IBM PC-to-Host protocols, files may not be successfully transferred
to Multics over high-speed lines.  The actual limit depends on the site
configuration and current load.


Notes on procedure for using micro_transfer: Use the following
procedure to transfer files between Multics and a microcomputer with
micro_transfer:
   1. Invoke the control program on the microcomputer.  This program is
      a terminal emulator and file transfer program.
   2. Connect to Multics by issuing the appropriate command to the
      microcomputer.  To find out which command to use, refer to the
      manual that documents the microcomputer's file transfer protocol.
      Once connected, the standard Multics banner is displayed.
   3. Login to Multics.
   4. Issue micro_transfer on Multics specifying the pathname on
      Multics and the applicable control arguments.


   5. Escape now back to the microcomputer.  The escape sequence used
      depends on the microcomputer.  To find out which escape sequence
      to use, refer to the manual that documents the microcomputer's
      file transfer protocol.  Upon return to the microcomputer, enter
      the type and direction of the file transfer and the microcomputer
      file name.  This must correspond to the type and direction
      specified on Multics.  For example, if you used micro_transfer
      -send, the command used for receiving a file transfer must be
      executed on the microcomputer.
   6. The file transfer begins.  A display indicating the status of the
      transfer may or may not occur, depending on the communications
      package residing on the microcomputer.
   7. At the end of the transfer, the microcomputer returns to the
      communications command level.
