:Info: print_motd: pmotd:  03/17/87  print_motd, pmotd


Syntax as a command:  pmotd {control arguments}


Function:  prints out changes to the message of the day.  The default is
to print changes to the system and user_project message_of_the_day
segments since the last time the command was called.


Control arguments:
    
-all_text, -all, -a
   specifies that the entire contents of the system and/or project
   message_of_the_day segment be displayed, regardless of
   whether or not any of the messages in the segment have been
   previously seen.

-current_project, -cpj
   prints lines from the message_of_the_day segment for the project
   on which the user is logged in.  If the project administrator has
   not created a message for your project, nothing is printed.
   (default)


-new_text, -new
   specifies that only unseen messages in the system and/or project
   message_of_the_day segment will be displayed. (default)

-project projects, -pj projects
   prints new or changed lines in the message_of_the_day segments for
   the named projects.  A warning is printed if there is no message
   for one or more of the projects.
   
-system, -sys
   prints lines from the message of the day segment created by the
   system administrator.  (default)


Notes:  If -system, -current_project and -project are not specified,
then print_motd prints lines from the system message and from the message
for the current project.  If one or more of these arguments are given,
then print_motd prints lines only from those messages.

For comparison purposes, copies of both the system and project motds are
stored in the user's default value segment.  print_motd will create the
value segment if necessary.  The project motds have the name
project_motd.PROJECT._ where PROJECT is the default user project or a
project specified by the -project control argument.  Project motds will 
be created by a project administrator and placed in the project directory
with the name >udd>PROJECT>PROJECT.motd with an addname of
>udd>PROJECT>PROJECT.info.  


The first time that print_motd is used for a specific project, it will
print the entire contents of the message of the day segment.  Subsequent
uses will default to print those lines which have been modified or added
to the message of the day since the last use of the command unless the user
specifies the -all_text control argument.  Since a copy of each motd
segment is stored in the user's value segment, project administrators 
should keep the size of the project motd segments to a minimum by deleting
older messages as they expire.
