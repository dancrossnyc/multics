:Info: reconnect.ec.gi: reconnect.ec: reconnect_ec.gi: reconnect_ec:  1982-06-17  reconnect.ec

An exec_com segment, prepared by the user and stored in the home
directory, that is invoked automatically when the user connects to a
disconnected process.  It is often used to execute commands such as
set_tty, to ensure that terminal modes are what the user desires them
to be.


Notes:  When a terminal is disconnected, none of its modes, set by
default or by set_tty commands, are remembered.  This is because the
old modes may not be appropriate to the terminal which is used to
reconnect to the process.  Thus, if the user typically sets various
terminal modes in the start_up.ec, or by explicit command, it may be
helpful to make a reconnect.ec which also sets these modes.  For the
same reason that the system does not retain modes across process
disconnection, the user shoud not automatically set modes which may
conflict with the characteristics of any of the terminals which might
be used.  An example of a device-independent terminal characteristic
which the user might choose to alter are the line editing characters.
The start_up.ec and reconnect.ec might both contain a set_tty command
to change the line editing (erase and kill) characters.
