10/17/84  reverse_after, rvaf

Syntax as a command:  rvaf STRA STRB


Syntax as an active function:  [rvaf STRA STRB]


Function:  performs the same function as the after command/active
function, but in reverse order.


Notes:  The active function returns that part of STRA following the
last occurrence of STRB in STRA (after uses the first occurrence).  If
STRB occurs last in STRA or does not occur at all, a null string is
returned.
   [reverse_after STRA STRB]
is the same as--
   [reverse [before [reverse STRA] [reverse STRB]]]
when STRB appears in STRA.  It is a null string when STRB does not
appear in STRA.
