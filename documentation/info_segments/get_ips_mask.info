05/04/84  get_ips_mask

Syntax as a command:  get_ips_mask {-control_args}


Function:  prints the current state of the IPS mask for the calling
process.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints the names of masked signals.  If no IPS signals are masked,
   it prints nothing.
-long, -lg
   prints a more descriptive message about the status of IPS signals,
   masked or unmasked.  (Default)


Notes:  If all undefined IPS signals are either masked or unmasked,
they are not mentioned.  If, however, some are masked and others are
not, an octal list is printed.  This can only happen when you have
supplied an invalid (probably reinitialized) value in a call to set
that mask.
