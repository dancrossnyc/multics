Syntax:  msla path access_names


Function:  lists all or part of the access control list (ACL) of a
given queue message segment.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a queue.  The ms suffix is assumed.  The star
   convention is allowed.
access_names
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  If
   all three components are present, the ACL entry with that name is
   listed.  If one or more components is missing, all ACL entries with
   matching names are listed.  (The matching strategy is described
   under "Notes" below.)  If no access control name is specified, or
   if the access control name is -all or -a, the entire ACL is listed.


Notes: The matching strategy for access control names is--

o  A literal component name, including "*", matches only a component of
   the same name.
o  A missing component name not delimited by a period is taken to
   be a literal "*" (e.g., "*.Multics" is treated as "*.Multics.*").
o  Missing components on the left must be delimited by periods.
o  A missing component name delimited by a period matches any component
   name.
