:Info: cv_dmcf:  1984-07-24  cv_dmcf

Syntax as a command:  cv_dmcf PATH


Function:  This command converts a configuration source file to a
configuration file (with suffix "dmct").  For the configuration file
to be used in initializing a Data Management system, it must have the
name "dm_configuration" on it and be located in the appropriate
per-AIM directory (commonly, >site>dm>system_low).


Arguments:
PATH
   is the pathname of the configuration source file.  The file must
   have the "dmcf" suffix on its entry name, which will be added to
   the PATH argument if not present.


Notes on source file:
The source file is composed of a series of statements of the form:

   keyword:  value;

with the final statement being:

   end;

The statements may be in any order, and there may be any number of
them.  Each keyword should appear only once.


List of keywords:
system_before_journal_size N
   sets the size of the system default before journal to N control
   intervals.  (DEFAULT -- 4000)
max_processes N
   sets the maximum number of processes which can be using DM at the
   same time to N.  (DEFAULT -- 256)
max_transactions N
   sets the maximum number of transactions which can be in progress at
   the same time to N.  (DEFAULT -- 128)


default_before_journal PATH_SPEC
   specifies the location of the default before journal.  PATH_SPEC is
   composed of one or both of dir=DIR and entry=ENTRY.  DIR is either
   an absolute pathname of the directory in which the default bj is to
   reside, "aim_dir", or "bootload_dir".  dir=aim_dir places the
   default bj in the AIM directory for the DM system being initialized.
   dir=bootload_dir places the default bj in the per-bootload DM
   directory.  (DEFAULT -- dir=aim_dir, entry=system_default.bj)
idle_timeout N
   sets the idle timeout of the daemon to wakeup every N minutes.  At
   every wakeup, the daemon cleans up any transactions which are
   waiting for its attention.  Generally, the daemon will keep
   transactions cleaned up as they need it because of other mechanisms
   (process termination notification, for instance).  The idle timeout
   mechanism is provided as insurance.  (DEFAULT -- 15 minutes)


user_shutdown_delay N
   sets the delay from shutdown_warning to user_shutdown to N minutes.
   (DEFAULT -- 5 minutes)
user_bump_delay N
   sets the delay from user_shutdown to user_bump to N minutes.
   (DEFAULT -- 5 minutes)
daemon_logout_delay N
   sets the delay from user_bump to daemon logout to N minutes.
   (DEFAULT -- 5 minutes)


prev_bootload_status OPTION_LIST
   determines how previous per-bootload DM system is handled when
   initializing a new DM system in the same AIM directory.
   Options in the OPTION_LIST are separated by commas.  Options are:
     hold - rename and retain the previous bootload directory.
            (DEFAULT -- off)
     adopt - if there is already a DM bootload directory for the
             current  Multics system bootload, adopt it.
	   (DEFAULT -- on)
     recover - attempt to recover the DM files associated with the
	   previous DM system. (DEFAULT -- on)
     recovery_check_mode - If on, continue recovering from a before
	   journal in spite of most errors encountered (which are
	   logged as they are encountered) processing images from
	   the journal.  (DEFAULT -- off)


current_bootload_enable STR
   specifies whether to force bringing up a new DM or not, in the face
   of errors in recovery.  If STR is "force" then the new DM will be
   enabled whether or not there are error encountered in recovering the
   old DM system.  If STR is "^force", then a new DM system will only
   be brought up if no errors were encountered while recovering the
   old DM system.  (DEFAULT -- ^force)
log_proc_terms STR
   determines whether or not the Data_Management Daemon will log
   process terminations.  The values for STR are "on" or "off".
   (DEFAULT -- on)
