07/30/86  Star and Equal Conventions (general information)

Starnames and equalnames are used when processing groups of objects
related by similar names.  Starnames are used to select objects, and
equalnames are used to construct related names.  They are often used
together.  For example, a star pathname might be used to select files
from one directory, and an equal pathname might be used to select
corresponding files from another directory.

information on equalnames, see equalname.gi.info.  For more information
on pathnames, see pathname.gi.info.
