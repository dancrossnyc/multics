Syntax:  crr request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function:	 allows a user to delete a request for a volume retrieval
that is no longer needed.


Arguments:
   request_identifiers can be chosen from the following:
path
   is the full or relative pathname of the segment or subtree of the
   retrieval request to be cancelled.  The star convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   identifies the request to be cancelled by STR, the entryname portion
   of the segment or subtree pathname.	The star convention is allowed.
-id ID
   identifies the request to be cancelled specified by its request ID
   number.  This identifier may be used to further define any path or
   -entry identifier (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   indicates that all retrieval queues are to be searched starting with
   the highest priority queue and ending with the lowest priority
   queue.	 This control argument is incompatible with the -queue
   control argument.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling the user that a particular request
   identifier was not found or that requests were cancelled when using
   star names or the -all control argument.


-queue N, -q N
   specifies that retrieval queue N contains the request to be
   cancelled, where N is a decimal integer specifying the number of the
   queue.	 If this control argument is omitted, only the default
   priority queue is searched.  This control argument is incompatible
   with the -all control argument.
-user User_id
   specifies the name of the submitter of the requests to be cancelled,
   if not equal to the group identifier of the process.  The User_id
   can be Person_id.Project_id, Person_id, or .Project_id.	Both r and
   d extended access to the queue are required.  This control argument
   is primarily for operators and administrators.


Access required:  The user must have o extended access to the queue to
cancel their own requests.  The user must have r and d extended access
to cancel a request entered by another user.


Notes:  If any path or -entry STR request identifiers are given, only
one -id ID request identifier will be accepted and it must match any
requests selected by path or entryname.

Multiple -id ID identifiers can be specified in a single command
invocation only if NO path or entry request identifiers are given.


Normally, deletion can be made only by the user who originated the
request.

When star names are not used and a single request identifier matches
more than one request in the queue(s) searched, none of the requests
are cancelled.  However, a message is printed telling how many matching
requests there are.
