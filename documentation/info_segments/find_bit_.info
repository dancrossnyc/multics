05/16/86  find_bit_

This subroutine uses the EIS test character and translate (TCT)
instruction to efficiently perform common bit string search operations.
Entrypoints are provided to return the bit index of the first or last
occurrence of an on bit ("1"b) or off bit ("0"b) in a bit string.


This subroutine operates by dividing the bit string into three search
regions:  a group of 9-bit bytes aligned on a byte boundary; bits
preceding these bytes; and bits following the bytes.  Bits preceding or
following the bytes are examined bit-by-bit, using a separate compare
bit (CMPB) instruction for each bit.  The bytes are examined as a
single character string, using one TCT instruction to test all bytes
until a byte containing an on or off bit is found.  For bit strings
longer than 36 bits, this subroutine is significantly faster than the
code generated by the PL/I index builtin function, which test all bits
on a bit-by-bit basis.


Entry points in find_bit_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  first_on:  05/16/86 find_bit_$first_on


Function:  This entrypoint returns the index (bit position) of the
first (leftmost) bit which is on ("1"b) in a bit string.


Syntax:
declare find_bit_$first_on entry (bit(*)) returns (fixed bin(24))
     reducible;

index = find_bit_$first_on (bit_string);


Arguments:
bit_string
   is the bit string to be examined.  (In)
index
   is the index of the first "1"b bit within the bit string.  If no
   "1"b bits are found, then 0 is returned.  (Out)


:Entry:  first_off:  05/16/86 find_bit_$first_off


Function:  This entrypoint returns the index (bit position) of the
first (leftmost) bit which is off ("0"b) in a bit string.


Syntax:
declare find_bit_$first_off entry (bit(*)) returns (fixed bin(24))
     reducible;

index = find_bit_$first_off (bit_string);


Arguments:
bit_string
   is the bit string to be examined.  (In)
index
   is the index of the first "0"b bit within the bit string.  If no
   "0"b bits are found, then 0 is returned.  (Out)


:Entry:  last_on:  05/16/86 find_bit_$last_on


Function:  This entrypoint returns the index (bit position) of the last
(rightmost) bit which is on ("1"b) in a bit string.


Syntax:
declare find_bit_$last_on entry (bit(*)) returns (fixed bin(24))
     reducible;

index = find_bit_$last_on (bit_string);


Arguments:
bit_string
   is the bit string to be examined.  (In)
index
   is the index of the last "1"b bit within the bit string.  If no "1"b
   bits are found, then 0 is returned.  (Out)


:Entry:  last_off:  05/16/86 find_bit_$last_off


Function:  This entrypoint returns the index (bit position) of the last
(rightmost) bit which is off ("0"b) in a bit string.


Syntax:
declare find_bit_$last_off entry (bit(*)) returns (fixed bin(24))
     reducible;

index = find_bit_$last_off (bit_string);


Arguments:
bit_string
   is the bit string to be examined.  (In)
index
   is the index of the last "0"b bit within the bit string.  If no "0"b
   bits are found, then 0 is returned.  (Out)
