Syntax:  .ifi fig_index "figure-title"


Function:
This compose macro adds a 'figure-title' to the list of Illustrations
in the Table of Contents if creation of such a list has been enabled
(see fig_on.info) without putting a centered Figure caption on the
output page.


Arguments:
'figure-title' is the title of the figure, as it is to appear in the
   list of Illustrations (first caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The fig_index macro is used to generate a list of Illustrations
   entry when, for any reason, the fig macro cannot be used to create
   the figure caption.
2) This macro advances the figure counter so care must be taken in
   referencing the figure in the text.
3) See fig.info, fig_on.info, and fig_get_no.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines produce a figure with a left-justified figure
caption.

			  F I G U R E
     .ifi fig_get_no 1
     .spb
     .ur Figure %figure%:  Figure Data, 1975
     .spb
     .ur Figure %figure% above reflects the 1975 data.
     .ifi fig_index "Figure Data, 1975"
