10/17/84  copy_dump

Syntax as a command:  copy_dump


Function: copies a dump image taken by BCE out of the DUMP partition
into the Multics hierarchy.  It creates as many segments (up to 10) in
>dumps as necessary to hold the dump image.

The name of each segment has the form
   mmddyy.tttt.s.eee
where:
mmddyy
   is the date the dump was taken.
tttt
   is the time the dump was taken.
s
   is a sequence number (0, 1, 2,...9).
eee
   is the error report form (ERF) number used in reporting this dump.




Entries: copy_dump$set_fdump_num, copy_dump$sfdn


Syntax as a command:  copy_dump$sfdn erfno


Function: This entry point sets the value of the next dump to be taken
by changing the value associated with the ERF number in the DUMP
partition.


Arguments:
erfno
   is the ERF number for the next dump to be taken.


Access required: This command uses hphcs_$copy_fdump and
hphcs_$set_fdump_num and, thus, requires access to hphcs_.


Notes: The DUMP partition is modified only after the last dump taken
has been copied.  If you attempt to change the ERF number before a dump
has been copied, an error message is returned.

This command does not allow a particular dump to be copied twice;
therefore it returns an error code if you attempt to recopy a dump.
