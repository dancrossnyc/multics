1983-10-28 Limitations in MRPG 1.1b

There are 2 areas where at least one user has run into a limitation of
MRPG which the user may work around.  These limits are not set high
because of the overhead involved in doing so, which every user of very
small amounts of data would have to pay for.  Here is described what
the big user needs to know to adjust to his need.


Number of variables declared:  The maximum is controlled by a
statement in mrpg.mrpg_lib.  The released library says
  &ext dclist{100}&;
This says that only 100 variable names may be defined.  Anyone needing
more may change the value of "100".


TABLE/SET size: The number of elements in a table or set is defined by
these 2 statements:
  &int fromlist{100}&;
  &int tolist{100}&;
The "100"s here may be increased to the size which the user needs.
