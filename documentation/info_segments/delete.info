01/23/86  delete, dl

Syntax as a command:  dl {paths} {-control_args}


Function: deletes the specified segments, multisegment files (MSFs),
data management (DM) files, and/or extended entries.  Use delete_dir to
delete directories; use unlink to delete links.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments, MSFs, DM files, or extended entries.
   The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the entire pathname of entries listed by -long, -query_all,
   and -query_each.
-brief, -bf
   does not print an error message if a segment, MSF, or DM file to be
   deleted is not found.
-chase
   deletes targets of links specified by paths as well as segments.
-entryname, -etnm
   prints only the entrynames of the entries listed by -long,
   -query_all, and -query_each, rather than the entire pathname.
   (Default)


-force, -fc
   deletes the specified entries, whether or not they are protected,
   without querying.
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-long, -lg
   prints a message of the form "Deleted file <path>" for each entry
   deleted.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a nonstandard entryname STR (e.g., invalid star name such
   as **.**.compout or name containing <).
-no_chase
   does not delete targets of links.  (Default)


-query_all, -qya
   lists all segments to be deleted and queries whether they should be
   deleted or not.  Unless you give -force, an individual query is
   given for protected segments.
-query_each, -qye
   queries for every entry to be deleted, whether it is protected or
   not.  Protected segments are noted in the query.


Access required: You must have modify permission on the containing
directory.


Notes: You must supply at least one path or -name STR.

To delete a segment or MSF the entry must have both its safety switch
and its copy switch off.  If either is on, you are interrogated whether
to delete the entry.

You can't delete DM files if a transaction is still pending.
