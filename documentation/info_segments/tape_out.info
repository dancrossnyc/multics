03/01/85	tape_out

Syntax as a command:  tape_out path {-control_args}


Function: transfers files from the storage system to magnetic tape.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the control file that governs the file
   transfer.  If pathname does not end with the .tcl suffix, it
   is assumed.


Control arguments:
-check, -ck
   specifies that only semantic checking be done on the TCL control
   file.	NO tapes are mounted if this option is specified.
-force, -fc
   specifies that the expiration date of a tape file to be
   overwritten is to be ignored.  This control argument extends
   unconditional permission to overwrite a tape file, regardless of
   the file's "unexpired" status.  This unconditional permission
   suppresses any query made by the I/O module to inquire about
   tape file's expiration date.


-ring
   mounts volumes of the volume-set with write permit rings.
-severityN, -svN
   causes the compiler's error messages with severity less
   than N (where N is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written into the
   "error_output" I/O switch.	The default value for N is 0.


Notes on the tcl source file:
The control file that governs the file transfer is actually a
program, written by the user, in the Tape Control Language (TCL).
The contents of this control file describe the file transfer.  The
same control file can be used with both the tape_in and tape_out
commands.

For additional information on the TCL, type help tcl.gi.
