12/08/88  copy, cp

Syntax as a command:  cp path1 {path2...path1N path2N} {-control_args}


Function: copies specified segments, multisegment files (MSFs), data
management (DM) files, and extended entries in the specified
directories with the specified names.  Optionally it copies access
control lists (ACLs), ring brackets, and multiple names.


Arguments:
path1
   is the pathname of a segment, MSF, DM file, and extended entry to be
   copied.  If it is the name of a link, the command copies the target
   of the link.  The star convention is allowed.  (See "Notes" below.)
path2
   is the pathname of a copy to be created from path1.  If you don't
   give path2N, the copy is placed in your working directory with the
   entryname of path1.  The equal convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-acl
   copies the ACL.
-all, -a
   copies multiple names, ACLs, and ring brackets.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses warning messages (see "Notes").
-chase
   copies the targets of links that match path1 (see "Notes" for the
   default).
-extend
   appends the contents of path1 to the contents' end of path2.  An
   error occurs if path2 does not already exist.


-force, -fc
   with -extend or -update, forces writing of the file contents
   regardless of whether you have write access to path2; in all other
   cases (replacing the entire file), forces deletion of an existing
   path2.
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-long, -lg
   prints warning messages.  (Default)
-name, -nm
   copies multiple names.
-no_acl
   does not copy the ACL.  (Default)


-no_chase
   does not copy the targets of links that match path1 (see "Notes").
-no_force, -nfc
   does not force write without write access or force deletion of an
   existing path2.  (Default)
-no_name, -nnm
   does not copy multiple names.  (Default)
-no_ring_brackets, -no_rb, -nrb
   does not copy ring brackets.  (Default)
-replace, -rp
   replaces the entire file path2, rather than modifying its contents
   as is done by -extend and -update.  (Default)


-ring_brackets, -rb
   copies the ring brackets of path1 to path2.  It is incompatible with
   -extend and -update.
-update, -ud
   replaces the contents of path2 with those of path1 without deleting
   path2 or changing any of its attributes.  An error occurs if path2
   does not already exist.


Access required: You need read access for path1; write access for
path2, unless you use -force with -extend or -update; status permission
for the directory containing path1 if you supply -acl, -all, or -name;
modify permission for the directory containing path2 if you give -acl,
-all, or -name; append permission for the directory containing path2 if
you select neither -extend nor -update.


Notes: The control arguments can appear once anywhere after the
command name and apply to the entire command line.

The default for chasing links depends on path1--if it is not a
starname, links are chased by default; if it is a starname, links are
not chased.

The initial ACL of the target directory doesn't affect the ACL of the
segment or multisegment file being copied.  The AIM access class of a
segment is not copied by -acl.


Since two entries in a directory cannot have the same entryname, copy
takes special action if the name of path1 already exists in the
directory specified by path2: if path1 has an alternate name, the
entryname that would have resulted in a duplicate name is removed, you
are informed of this action, and the copying operation takes place; if
path1 has only one entryname, the entry that already exists in the
directory must be deleted to remove the name, you are asked if the
deletion should be done, and the copying operation does not take place
if you answer "no."

This command prints a warning message if the bit count of path1 is less
than its current length ("Bit count inconsistent with current
length...") or if the current length is greater than the number of
records used ("Current length is not the same as records used...").


If copying a non-empty mailbox requires that the max_length
characteristic of the source be applied to the target, then the target
max_length value will take on the default value that was given it when
created.
