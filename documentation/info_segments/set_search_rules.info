Syntax:  ssr {path} {-control_arg}


Function:	 sets, with only minor restrictions, your dynamic linking
search rules to suit your needs.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment containing the ASCII representation of
   search rules.  Search rules are absolute pathnames and any of the
   keywords listed below in "List of keywords", one search rule per
   line.	If path is not specified, the search rules must be reset to
   the default search rules by -default.


Control arguments:
-default, -df
   resets the search rules to the default search rules, as set for a
   new process.


List of keywords:
initiated_segments
   checks the already-initiated segments.
referencing_dir
   searches the containing directory of the segment making the
   reference.
working_dir
   searches the working directory.
home_dir
   searches the home directory.


process_dir
   searches the process directory.
site_defined
   expand into one or more directory pathnames.  (An example of a
   site_defined keyword is system_libraries.)  See the
   get_system_search_rules command for an explanation of the values of
   these keywords.	The "default" keyword can be used to obtain the
   site-defined default rules.


Notes:  A maximum of 21 rules is allowed.  Leading and trailing blanks
are allowed, but embedded blanks are not.

If you decide not to include the system libraries in the search
rules, many standard commands cannot be found.

See the add_search_rules, delete_search_rules, and print_search_rules,
info segments.  The standard search rules are described in Section 4
under "Search Rules" in the Programmer's Reference Manual (AG91).
