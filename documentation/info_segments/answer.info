Syntax:  answer STR {-control_args} command_line


Function:	 provides preset answers to questions asked by another
command.


Arguments:
STR
   is the desired answer to any question.  If the answer is more than
   one word, it must be enclosed in quotes.  If STR is -query, the
   question is passed on to you.  The -query control argument is
   the only one that can be used in place of STR.
command_line
   is any Multics command line.  It can contain any number of separate
   arguments (i.e., have spaces within it) and need not be enclosed in
   quotes.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing (on your terminal) of both the question
   and the answer.
-call STR
   evaluates the active function string STR to obtain the next answer
   in a sequence.  STR must be quoted if it contains command language
   characters.  The surrounding brackets must be omitted, as in "segs
   *.pl1".  The return value "true" is translated to "yes", and "false"
   to "no".  All other return values are passed as is.


-match STR
   answers only questions whose text matches STR.	 If STR is surrounded
   by slashes (/), it is interpreted as a qedx regular expression.
   Otherwise, answer tests whether STR is literally contained in the
   text of the question.  Multiple occurrences of -match and -exclude
   are allowed (see Notes below).  They apply to the entire command
   line.
-exclude STR, -ex STR
   passes on, to you or other handler, questions whose text
   matches STR.  If STR is surrounded by slashes (/), it is interpreted
   as a qedx regular expression.  Otherwise, answer tests whether STR
   is literally contained in the text of the question.  Multiple
   occurrences of -match and -exclude are allowed (see Notes below).
   They apply to the entire command line.


-query
   skips the next answer in a sequence, passing on the question to you.
   The answer is read from the user_io I/O switch.
-then STR
   supplies the next answer in a sequence.
-times N
   gives the previous answer (STR, -then STR, or -query) N times only,
   where N is an integer.


Notes:  Answer provides preset responses to questions by establishing
an on unit for the condition command_question and then by executing the
designated command.	 If the specified  command calls the command_query_
subroutine (see the Subroutines manual) to ask a question, the on
unit is invoked to supply the answer.  The on unit is reverted when the
answer command returns to command level.  See "List of System
Conditions and Default Handlers" in the Programmer's Reference Manual
for a discussion of the command_question condition.

If a question is asked that requires a yes or no answer, and the preset
answer is neither "yes" nor "no", the on unit is not invoked.

The last answer specified is issued as many times as necessary, unless
followed by -times.


The -match and -exclude control arguments are applied in the order
specified.  Each -match causes a given question to be answered if it
matches STR; each -exclude causes it to be passed on if it matches STR.
A question that has been excluded by -exclude is reconsidered if it
matches a -match later in the command line.  For example, the command
line

answer yes -match /fortran/ -exclude /fortran_io/ -match /^fortran_io/

answers questions containing the string "fortran" or beginning with
"fortran_io", but does not answer questions containing "fortran_io".
