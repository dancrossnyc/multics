06/20/87  generate_pnotice

Syntax as a command:  generate_pnotice {-control_args}


Function:  allows Multics source and object archives and executable
software to be legally protected via copyright or trade secret notices
and provides software identification via Software Technical Identifiers
(STIs).


Control arguments:
-id STR
   specifies the Marketing Identifier (MI) of the product as derived
   from psp_info_.  This control argument and -name are mutually
   exclusive.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies the product's generic name found in psp_info_.
-special
   used in cases where there may be no entry in psp_info_ for the
   software being protected.  This likely occurs when you are
   protecting software in a user or development library.  You are
   prompted for the information to be put into the PNOTICE segments.
   "See Notes".

-sti STR
   specifies a valid 12-character Software Technical Identifier (STI).
   You can use it to override the STI found in psp_info_ when you give
   -name or -id.  Only Honeywell software uses STI's.


Notes:  This command allows protection of software residing in a
library other than the one specified in psp_info_ or of software not
specified in psp_info_, via -special.


The command generates ALM source and object segments with the names of
"PNOTICE_<generic name>.alm" and "PNOTICE_<generic name>", where
<generic name> comes from the psp_info_ data base or from -special.


These segments contain the text of one or more software protection
notices and three 12-character STIs.  The segments are appended to a
product's primary source and object archives, as defined in the
psp_info_ data base.  If you select -special, you must provide these
archive names.  If PNOTICE segments with the same name exist in the
archives, they are replaced.  Order the archives such that PNOTICE
components are the first components (e.g., use archive_sort to place
the PNOTICE component first).  The binding of the object archive places
the protection notices and STIs into the bound segment as well.  Make
the bindfile "Order" statement indicate that the PNOTICE component is
first.  Don't retain the PNOTICE entrypoint name in the bound segment.


To find PNOTICE segments' information for installed products, issue the
display_psp command.


Unless you use -special, the source and object archives must be in your
working directory, in which case you must have sma access to the
directory as well as rw access to the archives; then you can specify
archive pathnames to generate_pnotice.  If you supply -special, access
is checked, and if it is not sufficient it is forced; otherwise, access
is not forced.


When -special is selected, the following set of questions is asked.
Have the requested information ready.


Generic name?
   You supply a short (<= 20 characters) name that is descriptive of
   the module(s) being protected.  The name can be the same one
   contained in psp_info_ if the module is a newer version; otherwise,
   you can create the name.


STI?
   This is the Software Technical Identifier, a 12-character identifier
   used by Honeywell to provide information on released software
   products.  It can be blank for user software.


Include the notices from psp_info?
   The module(s) being protected have an entry in psp_info_.  You are
   asked whether the notices there are to be included.


Source pnotice name?
   You are asked to provide primary names of notices, without the
   .pnotice suffix, for protection of source.  The default arguments
   -default_copyright (-dc) or -default_trade_secret (-dts) may be
   input in place of the primary name.  When done, type "q".  Use the
   list_pnotice_names command for available names.


Object pnotice name?
   You are asked to provide primary names of notices, without the
   .pnotice suffix, for protection of object and executable.  The
   default arguments -default_copyright (-dc) or -default_trade_secret
   (-dts) may be input in place of the primary name.  When done, type
   "q".  Use the list_pnotice_names command for available names.


Pathname of source archive?
   You are asked to provide an archive pathname of the source archive.
   The ".archive" suffix is not required, but can be given.


Pathname of object archive?
   You are asked to provide an archive pathname of the object archive.
   The suffix .archive is not required, but can be given.


These two archives need reside neither in the same directory nor in the
working directory.  Using the same archive for both source and object
pnotices, will cause an archive format error.


A given archive may contain several copyright notices or several trade
secret notices or a public domain notice, but cannot contain a mixture
of pnotice types.

the Multics Library Maintenance SDN (Order No.  AN80).
