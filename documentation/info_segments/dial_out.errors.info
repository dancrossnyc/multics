Description

23  phx20495
dial_out -raw translates LFs typed by the user into CRs transmitted
down the comm line.  It's difficult to transmit a raw LF.

22  phx18903
"quit" mode should imply tty_ "^hndlquit" mode.

21  phx18645
dial_out raw mode doesn't work in the Video System.

19  phx18127
A recursive invocation of "dial_out -profile X" will terminate
X.profile too many times, causing the outer invocation to fault.  This
error also affects non-recursive uses of dial_out when the profile
being used is also being used by another application (e.g.  the default
command processor profile if the dial_out user just specifies -abbrev
and lets the profile default).

18  phx17769
The terminal type specified with dial_out -ttp should be uppercased
before the set_term_type control order is issued.

16  phx15559
If using "quit" mode, then any error returned while sending the
interrupt because of hitting BREAK causes dial_out to abort the entire
invocation.

15  phx16761 phx19733 phx20154
If there is a syntax error in the "-modes" parameter, random errors,
and sometimes fatal process errors, can occur.  This is because the
cleanup handler restores the cl_intermediary, even though the variable
used to save the cl_intermediary has not been set.

8  phx16403
If you suspend dial_out, change your tty modes, and then start up the
dial_out, when you later exit dial_out your modes will be back the way
they were when you started dial_out initially.

7  phx16150
The send_file request faults if the pathname argument is not given.

5  phx16304
The wait request doesn't always clean up its timer.

3  phx16306
The "quit" and "interrupt" requests do not complain if given arguments,
although they ignore them.
