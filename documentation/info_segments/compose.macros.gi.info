10/17/81	Documentation macros

A set of compose documentation macros is available for general use.
These macros may be a useful tool for users doing online documentation.
The macros do such things as page formatting, generation of page
headers and footers, font selection for section and paragraph titles,
spacing, and generating a Table of Contents - all automatically.

Each macro is 'called' by inserting one line in a compin segment.  The
desired result is produced when the segment is composed.  (Type "help
compose" for information on compose as compose knowledge is necessary
in order to use these macros effectively.)  The macros follow current
Honeywell standards and specific Multics documentation format rules.


WARNING:
These macros are dynamic and are changed from time to time to provide
new features and to take advantage of new features in compose.  Users
who make copies in order to obtain their own format are warned to check
each macro installation (with compare_ascii) to discover necessary
updates to their private copies.

This info segment briefly describes the actions of the various macros
and lists the macros according to function (general purpose, figure and
table, addenda, or miscellaneous).  More detailed information on a
specific macro can be found in the info segment for that macro (e.g.,
if you want information on preface, type "help preface.compin").


Macro Actions:
1. provide standard spacing around paragraph titles (e.g, 2 spaces
   above and 1 below for standard size page; see init.compin.info for
   more information)
2. generate proper formatting of section and paragraph title, based on
   the following Honeywell standard:
      Level 0:  typed    - full caps, centered, new page
      	      photoset - 18 pt Century Schoolbook Bold Italic,
      		       initial caps, flush right, new page
      Level 1:  typed    - full caps, underlined, flush left
      	      photoset - 10 pt Helvetica Bold Roman, full caps,
      		       flush left
      Level 2:  typed    - initial caps, underlined, flush left
      	      photoset - 10 pt Helvetica Bold Italic, full caps,
      		       flush left
      Level 3:  typed    - full caps, flush left
      	      photoset - 10 pt Helvetica Roman, full caps,
      		       flush left
      Level 4:  typed    - initial caps, flush left
      	      photoset - 10 pt Helvetica Medium Italic,
      		       initial caps, flush left


3. assure sufficient space on current page for new paragraph title and
   related text
4. generate Table of Contents automatically, based on heading level
   macros used
5. generate page footers
6. generate page headers for command or subroutine descriptions
   (identified as 'module' text in macros; see l1h.compin.info for more
   information on modules)
7. generate table header and figure caption titles with proper spacing
   between title and item
8. keep a table counter and a figure counter so the number in the title
   is incremented automatically and user can make references without
   knowing the actual number of the table or figure


9. generate a list of Tables and a list of Illustrations for the Table
   of Contents segments automatically, based on the table and figure
   macros used
10.generate dot pages for addenda (e.g., pages 2.1 and 2.2 between
   existing pages 2 and 3; see dot_page.compin.info for further
   information)
11.show command arguments and control arguments, and subsystem
   requests, using 10pt Helvetica Medium for literal fields and 10pt
   Helvetica Bold Italic for variable fields.


Title splitting:
All titles can be made to break at points of the users choice by
inserting exclamation points (!) where the breaks are to occur.  The
exclamation points are removed from Table of Contents entries and do
not affect the splitting of such entries.  If no exclamation points are
used, the titles will be split according the current line measure.


General purpose macros:
init, init_mpm, init_plm
     initialize macro environment (one of these should be used before
     any other macros are used, i.e., easiest to have an 'init' macro
     as the first line in each segment in which the user wants to use
     other macros)
l0h
     generate section heading; initialize Table of Contents for new
     section
l1h, l2h, l3h, l4h
     generate paragraph headings (including 'module' page headers; see
     l1h.compin.info for more information); generate Table of Contents
     entries
l1hbox, l2hbox, l3hbox, l4hbox
     generate 'box' page headers as for 'module' text above


l0exact, l2exact, l2exact, l3exact, l4exact
l0toc, l1toc, l2toc, l3toc, l4toc
     generate section and paragraph headings that contain special
     strings (i.e., strings that are exceptions to the font selection
     rules above); generate Table of Contents entries that contain
     special strings
l0setup, l1setup, l2setup, l3setup, l4setup
     generate page headers and footers so module segments can be output
     properly without beginning on first page (only needed for 'module'
     text; see l1h.compin.info for more information on modules)
toc_on
     turn on Table of Contents generation
active_function
     place a title reading "SYNTAX AS AN ACTIVE FUNCTION" and show an
     active function syntax line.


argument
     show the syntax of a command argument.
argument_list
     place a title reading "ARGUMENTS".
bullet
     place a bullet hanging left by one indentation level.
command
     place a title reading "SYNTAX AS A COMMAND" and show a command
     syntax line.
controlargument
     show the syntax of a control argument.
controlargument_list

example, example_off
     control the generation of an example terminal session contained in
     a ruled box.


example_line_number

request
     show a subsystem request syntax line.
slug_off
     cancel any existing page header (particularly, box headers).


Figure and table macros:
fig_on, tab_on
     turn on list of Illustrations/Tables generation
fig, tab
     reset 'dot' number counter, advance figure/table counter, generate
     centered Figure caption/Tableheader, generate list of
     Illustrations/Tables entry.
dot_fig, dot_tab
