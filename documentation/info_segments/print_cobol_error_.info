:Entry: print_cobol_error_:  02/08/83  print_cobol_error_


Function: allows the COBOL programmer to display the cause and
location of a runtime error.  It is meaningful only when called from
within a USE procedure in the DECLARATIVE section of a COBOL program.
The error information displayed pertains to the error causing the
current execution of the USE procedure.  This is identical to the
messages that would have been printed on the terminal before aborting
the program (i.e., signalling the "error" condition) had no USE
procedure been provided.

The print_cobol_error_ entry point displays the error information
through the user_output I/O switch.


Syntax:
call "print_cobol_error_".


:Entry:  switch:  02/08/83 print_cobol_error_$switch


Function:  This entry point outputs the error information to a
specified I/O switch.


Syntax:
01 switch-name pic x(32).
call "print_cobol_error_$switch" using switch-name.


Arguments:
switch-name
   is the name of an I/O switch that is open for output.  (Input) This
   includes user_output and error_output, as well as the I/O switch
   associated with any open external COBOL file, i.e., the
   internal-file-name as specified in the SELECT clause of the
   ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
