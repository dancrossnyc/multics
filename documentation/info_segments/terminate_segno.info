07/25/86  terminate_segno, tms

Syntax as a command:  tms segnos


Function: removes a segment number(s) from your address space and resets
links to the terminated segment(s).  It is commonly used prior to
initiating a different version of a program.


Arguments:
segnos
   are segment numbers (in octal) to be terminated.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the error message printed when you give an invalid segno.
-long, -lg
   does not suppress the above error message.  (Default)


Notes: This command allows termination by segment number rather than
by pathname.

Be careful not to unintentionally terminate a segment of the command
language interpreter or another critical piece of the environment.
Fatal process errors usually result from such an action.

The star convention is not recognized.

If the segment number given identifies a component of an object MSF,
all of the components of the MSF are terminated, and links to them
unsnapped.
