02/20/84  Interprocedure Linking

An external reference in a program can be resolved by dynamic linking
or static binding.  The bind command resolves references between
object segments in a set of archives and produces a bound object
segment.

The dynamic linker is invoked automatically to satisfy a linkage fault
if a reference is made through an unsnapped link.  The linker uses the
search rules to bind the reference name in the external reference to a
segment; it then examines the definition section of the segment for
the entry point or offset name definition and completes the snapping
of the link.

For more information on interprocedure linking, see the Programmer's
Reference Manual.
