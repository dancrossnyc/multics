:Info: mailbox.gi: 02/25/82 mailbox

     A message segment used to convey messages between processes.  See
the read_mail and accept_messages commands.


:Info: main_memory_frame.gi: 02/25/82 main memory frame

     A 1024 36-bit word block of main memory that holds a page of a
segment.


:Info: making_a_segment_known.gi: 02/25/82 making a segment known

     Specifying the pathname of a segment to the supervisor, and
receiving a segment number in return.  The segment may then be
referenced by that segment number in the process.  See the initiate 
command.


:Info: master_directory.gi: 02/25/82 master directory

     A directory whose segments reside on a different logical volume
than those of its parent directory.


:Info: memory_units.gi: 02/25/82 memory units

     A measure of the usage a user makes of the system memory
resources.


:Info: message_segment.gi: 02/25/82 message segment

     A special type of segment that is managed by Multics supervisor
programs and is not directly accessible to the user.  A message
segment is simply a permanent place to hold interprocess messages,
e.g., dprint and dpunch requests.


:Info: Multics_card_code.gi: multics_card_code.gi: MCC.gi: mcc.gi: 02/25/82 Multics card code (MCC)

     A code for punched card input and output.  It is essentially the
IBM standard EBCDIC card code.  This is the default code for the
dpunch command.


:Info: multiple_names.gi: 02/25/82 multiple names

     A segment, directory, multisegment file, or link can have more
than one name and may be referred to equally well by any one of its
names.  One of the names is the primary name.  A segment often has
more than one name because it is a program with alternate entry
points; commands often have short names as well as long ones for
convenience in typing (i.e., cwd instead of change_wdir).  


:Info: multisegment_file.gi: MSF.gi: msf.gi: 02/25/82 multisegment file (MSF)

     A file that occupies more than one segment, i.e., a file larger
than 261120 words.  May only be manipulated by certain programs.


:Info: newline.gi: 03/05/82 newline

     The newline, caused by typing the key labeled "RETURN" (or
another key designated for this purpose, such as "CR" or "LF"),
consists of two actions: a carriage return and a linefeed.  It is the
signal to Multics that a command line is ready to be processed.


:Info: nondiscretionary_access.gi: 02/25/82 nondiscretionary access 

     Also referred to as administrative access control, it is used to
restrict discretionary controls in order to enforce the policies of
the system administrator and of the organizations served by the
system.  The system administrator (through AIM) guarantees that only
authorized persons may access certain classes of information.


:Info: object_segment.gi: 02/25/82 object segment

     A procedure or data segment produced as the result of a
compilation with a system-defined format.  An executable object
segment can be directly executed by a process.  Object segments may
also be searched and linked to by the dynamic linking mechanism.
