:Info: start_up.ec: start_up_ec.gi: start_up_ec:  1974-03-15  start_up.ec

A user can specify that a set of commands be executed when a process
is initialized, i.e.  after a login, new_proc, or process termination.
The commands are specified as an exec_com segment in the user's
initial working directory with the name start_up.ec.  If the segment
start_up.ec exists in the user's initial working directory, the
printing of the message of the day is suppressed and exec_com is
called to execute the commands specified in the segment.  The call to
exec_com is issued as the first command to the new process before any
lines are read from the terminal.  The call to exec_com is issued as
the command:
    exec_com start_up CREATION_TYPE PROCESS_TYPE


Arguments:
CREATION_TYPE
   is the string "login" if the process has been created as the result
   of a login; or is the string "new_proc" if the process has been
   created as the result of a new_proc command or process termination.
PROCESS_TYPE
   is the string "interactive" if the process being initialized is an
   interactive one; or is the string "absentee" if the process is an
   non-interactive absentee process.


Notes:
To print the message-of-the-day, the command "help motd" can be issued
from the exec_com.
