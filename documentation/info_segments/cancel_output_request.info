Syntax as a command:  cor request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function:  deletes an I/O daemon request that is no longer needed.


Arguments:
   request_identifiers can be chosen from the following:
path
   identifies a request to be canceled by the full or relative
   pathname of the input data segment.  The star convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   identifies a request to be canceled by STR, the entryname portion
   of the input data segment pathname.  The star convention is allowed.
-id ID
   identifies one or more requests to be canceled by a request
   identifier.  This identifier can be used to further define any path
   or -entry identifier (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   searches all priority queues for the specified request type starting
   with the highest priority queue and ending with the lowest.  This
   control argument is incompatible with -queue.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling that a particular request identifier was
   not found or that requests were canceled when using star names or
   -all.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies that queue N of the request type contains the request to
   be canceled, where N is a decimal integer specifying the number of
   the queue.  If -queue is omitted, only the default queue for the
   request type is searched.  This control argument is incompatible
   with -all.


-print, -pr
   specifies that the requests to be canceled are found in the queue(s)
   associated with the default printer request type (see "Notes").
-punch, -pch
   specifies that the requests canceled are found in the queue(s)
   associated with the default punch request type (see "Notes").
-plot
   specifies that the requests canceled are found in the queue(s)
   associated with the default plotter request type (see "Notes").
-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   indicates that the request to be canceled is to be found in the
   queue for the request type identified by the string STR (see
   "Notes").


-user User_id
   specifies the name of the submitter of the request to be canceled,
   if not the group identifier of the process.  The User_id can be
   equal to Person_id.Project_id, Person_id, or .Project_id.  Both r
   and d extended access to the queue are required.  This control
   argument is primarily for operators and administrators.


Access required:  You must have o extended access to the queue to
cancel your own requests.  You must have r and d extended access
to cancel a request entered by another user.


Notes:  If the request is already running, the running request will not
be stopped and the request's entry will not be removed from the queue.
A warning message will be displayed to warn the user of this action.

Multiple -id ID identifiers can be specified in a single command
invocation only if no path or entry request identifiers are given.

If any path or -entry STR request identifiers are given, only one -id
ID request identifier is accepted and it must match any requests
selected by path or entryname.

When star names are not used and a single request identifier matches
more than one request in the queue(s) searched, none of the requests
are canceled; however, a message is printed telling how many matching
requests there are.


Normally, deletion can be made only by the user who originated the
request.

The -print, -punch, -plot and -request_type control arguments are
mutually exclusive.  Only one can be selected in a given command.  If
none are supplied, then cor searches the default request type used by
eor -print (as displayed by the print_request_types command).

and cancel_daemon_request.
