07/09/90  delete_name, dn

Syntax as a command:  dn {paths} {-control_args}


Function: deletes specified name(s) from segments, multisegment files
(MSFs), links, directories, data management (DM) files, or extended
entries that have multiple names.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames to be deleted.  This argument can be "-name STR"
   to specify a nonstandard name, such as one beginning with a minus
   sign or containing * or >.  The star convention is allowed, but does
   not apply to STR.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses error messages when entries are not found with specified
   pathnames.
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-long, -lg
   prints error messages when entries are not found.  (Default)


Access required: You need modify permission on the parent directory.


Notes: At least one path or -name STR must be specified.  The final
portion of the relative or absolute pathname is deleted from the
storage system entry it specifies, provided that doing so does not
leave the segment or directory without a name, in which case an error
message is printed.

See the add_name and rename commands.
