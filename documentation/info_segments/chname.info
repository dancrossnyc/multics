02/06/84  chname

Syntax:  chname Person_id {mailing_name}


Function: allows the accounting administrator to change the mailing
name for a user.  The full name must be enclosed in quotes if it is
given on the command line.  If the new name is not given, the old name
is displayed and a change is accepted.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose mailing name is to be changed.
mailing_name
   is the new mailing name of the user.  It must be enclosed in quotes.
   If this argument is omitted, the chname command prints the old
   mailing name and then waits for the accounting administrator to
   enter the user's new mailing name (which should not be enclosed in
   quotes in this case) or enter a null line (to retain the old value).
