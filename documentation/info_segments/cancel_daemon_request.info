06/25/90  cancel_daemon_request, cdr

Syntax as a command:  cdr request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function: deletes an I/O daemon request that is no longer needed.


Arguments:
   request_identifiers can be chosen from the following:
path
   identifies a request to be canceled by the full or relative pathname
   of the input data segment.  The star convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   identifies a request to be canceled by STR, the entryname portion of
   the input data segment pathname.  The star convention is allowed.
-id ID
   identifies one or more requests to be canceled by request
   identifier.  You can use this identifier to further define any path
   or -entry identifier (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   searches all priority queues for the specified request type starting
   with the highest priority queue and ending with the lowest.  It is
   incompatible with -queue.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling that a particular request identifier was
   not found or that requests were canceled when using star names or
   -all.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies that queue N of the request type contains the requests to
   be canceled, where N is a decimal integer specifying the number of
   the queue.  If you omit it, all the queues are searched.


-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   indicates that the request to be canceled is to be found in the
   queue for the request type identified by STR.  If you don't supply
   -request_type, the default is "printer."  The print_request_types
   command lists the request types.
-user User_id
   specifies the name of the submitter of the request to be canceled if
   it is not the same as the group identifier of the process.  The
   User_id can be equal to Person_id.Project_id, Person_id, or
   .Project_id.  Both r and d extended access to the queue are
   required.  This control argument is primarily for operators and
   administrators.


Access required: You need o extended access to the queue to cancel
your own request and r and d extended access to cancel somebody else's
request.


Notes: If you supply -id, only one path or -entry is allowed.  If you
give -id in addition to a path or -entry, they must match the same
request.  If you provide any path or -entry STR request identifiers,
only one -id ID request identifier is accepted and it must match any
requests selected by path or entryname.

You can specify multiple -id ID identifiers in a single command
invocation only if you give no path or -entry request identifiers.

When you don't use star names and a single request identifier matches
more than one request in the queue(s) searched, none of the requests
are canceled; however a message is printed telling how many matching
requests there are.


Normally, deletion can be made only by the user who originated the
request.

If the request is already running, the running request will not be
stopped and the request's entry will not be removed from the queue.
A warning message will be displayed to warn the user of this action.

See the dprint, dpunch, and enter_output_request commands.
