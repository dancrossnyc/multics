Description

57  phx18766
The TR says that 1 too many characters are created when a character is
decompressed.  Assuming this is true, it comes from a
mis-interpretation of the RBF spec.  That is, apparently the
compression count includes the character that was compressed, whereas,
I assumed it did not.  The fix is to change line 769 in rbf_.pl1 to set
the compression_count to 1, and change line 778 to use
compression_count - 1, rather than compression_count.

56  phx17349
The network_request command (in l6_tran_$parser) should not check for
11 arguments, since there may legally be more than 11.  In trying to be
user friendly, I miscounted the maximum number of arguments.

52  phx16410
The 6M PAD command implements a feature which allows the definition of
a "rotary group" of x25 subchannels for use by the PAD.  The TRANX
command does not implement this rotary feature, but it should.  The
documentation should make this clear, and it should be changed in the
next release to do the rotary connect.

51  
The nr command and the l6_tran_overseer_ should allow transfer of
Multics multi-segment files.  These are currently rejected by a status
check which finds them to be directories.

49  phx15902
This TR describes one problem with sending multiple files from Multics
to the L6.  I do not have this problem at CISL, however, when I
transfer multiple files they all get concatenated into the first file.

48  phx15897
There seems to be some problem with the configuration specified in the
TR which causes the DPS6 to hang when Multics tries to initiate a
connection to it.  This does not occur at any other site, and it is not
known if it occurs here with MOD400 Rel.  3.0.  As reported, this also
occurs with Rel.  3.0.  No other site has this problem, so it must
still be something to do with the configuration.

47  phx15893
The 6M PAD will not interrupt a partial input line with pending output.
This is because of the way ATD works, and the fact that the terminal
connection is really handled in a half-duplex fashion.

46  phx15894
The 6M PAD outputs a LF character when it forwards a long line due to
exceeding the packet character count.  This is probably caused by the
interaction between the PAD and ATD.  The PAD puts up a read that
terminates either with a CR or on character count.  If it terminates on
character count, ATD outputs a LF gratuitously.

The other problem associated with this is if the DPS6 line and
character editing characters are used, they can only affect the
untransmitted portion of the input line.  Thus if you type a long line,
part of which is forwarded, and then type @ to delete the line, only
the untransmitted portion will be deleted.  

45  phx15932
The PAD can run in a swap pool, but not if it is being used through
RNP.  If these are to be run together, make sure the PAD is not in the
swap pool.

43  phx15770
In order for the PAD to correctly handle escape sequences which may be
sent at line speed (e.g from a function key), it buffers up things that
start with ESC until it gets another character.  This causes a problem
with emacs ITS search mode which ends things with ESC.  See error list
entries 30 and 2 for the related problems.  THis limitation will be
noted in the documentation.

41  phx15761
The 6M PAD should allow a TTY configured as '7300' to be used.  It
should also print an error message if an unsupported terminal type is
used, rather than quietly returning to L6 command level.

40  phx15760
TRANX must log into Multics to initiate a file transfer.  Currently it
uses a very simple-minded parse of the greeting banner to find out
where to send the user login line and password.  This fails when
padding characters are sent as part of the greeting banner and password
prompt.  (For instance, if the default terminal type for the login
channel specifies output padding.)

39  phx15759
The L6 file transfer protocol as implemented by the TRANX command is
not very good at interpreting errors from the host.  The protocol
should be modified to correctly diagnose and report errors to the L6
user.

36  
In Mod 400 release 3.0, there is a problem with the handling of the
operating system clock.  It cannontt be turned off.  This causes any
breakall mode application not to work (e.g.  emacs, video).

34  
When transferring a very large file from the L6 to Multics (initiated
by the L6), the Multics side seems to get a fatal process error.  This
seems to be dependent of the baud rate of the connection, ie.  at
slower speeds this happens sooner, and at higher speeds it takes
longer.  According to the stack of the dead process, l6_tran_overseer_
returned to initialize_process, something it should not do.

33  
The PAD occasionally terminates a connection with the message:  "APAD:
(830603) 35 BLOCK RETURNED IS NOT WITHIN ITS OWN MEMORY POOL".  This
mostly seems to happen on a 9600 baud terminal connection.  After it
happens the user can reinvoke the PAD and connect again.

31  
The L6 can only handle file names of 12 characters or less.  When doing
a starname type of transfer from Multics, if one of the Multics segment
names is more than 12 characters, the transfer will abort.  This is
also true if the user types in a name longer than 12 characters by
hand.

27  
When using TRANX initiated from Multics the following rules must be
followed in configuring the x.25 connection.  First, the packet size on
both the Multics and L6 sides must be 128 (this is the default, so the
best bet is not to use the "packet_size" argument in the TTF).  Second,
the baud_rate in the CMF for the channel should be set to at least
9600, regardless of whether the actual physical connection is slower
than that.  This baud rate is not used for any physical parameters and
only affects the minimum tty buffer size used for the channel.

18  phx15764 phx15907 phx15912
The L6 PAD handles PAD parameter 3 set to 2 (forward on CR)
incorrectly.  When parameter 3 is set to 2, the L6 PAD uses L6
character erase/kill and backslash processing on the input line (i.e.
@ deletes a char, ^X deletes the line, and \ is an escape character
locally).  This is because the PAD does line at a time input through
ATD which is where this editing is done.  

17  phx15791
While in the video system, i.e.  with PAD parameter 2 set to "no echo",
typing a ^G causes an immediate bell, and also sends the ^G to Multics.
This is probably caused by the ATD handler echoing a bell on receipt of
the ^G.  There should be a way to get the correct behavior.

14  
It is very easy to get the L6 to stop listening to a terminal, and it
is very hard to get it back.  That is, none of the documented ways
(SET_LISTEN, etc.)  seems to work.  The only solution seems to be to
reboot the L6

13  
The PAD should not discard characters when the PAD parameters change in
most cases.  For instance, when echoing is turned off to mask the
password.  Recomendation X.29, section 3.1.2 says:  "The PAD will also
consider the arrival of such a PAD message [set, read, or set and read]
as a data forwarding condition in the direction PAD to packet mode
DTE."

9  
The L6 PAD has problems communicating with a terminal connected to the
L6 through the RNP6 network software.  The main problem seems to be tha
RNP cannot handle character at a time reads from the PAD.  Currently,
since Multics sets PAD parameter 3 to 2 (forward on CR) by default, and
this causes the PAD to do line at a time reads, the RNP network can be
used through the PAD.  However, the solution to error #18 will probably
have some impact on this behavior.

5  
A VIP7801 terminal connected to the L6 must be configured as a TTY or
'7200' type device in the CLM_USER file if it will use the PAD to
connect to Multics.  No functionality is lost because all normal
Multics terminal handling is available once the connection is made.

4  
A terminal which is going to use the L6 PAD command to make a
connection to Multics must be connected to the L6 through an MLCP
channel.  It can not be connected through a MDC channel.  Also, the
channel must be configured in the CLM_USER file using the ATD directive
(not TTY or KSR).

3  phx14985 phx15794 phx17276
The L6 PAD sometimes can not keep up with fast typing and looses input.
This is signalled by a "beep".  The user must retype the input.  This
problem is especially visible when input is typed while output is
coming to the terminal.  This is probably caused by the fact that the
ATD handler gives priority to writes to the terminal rather than to
reads from the terminal.

The answering service and the x25 multiplexer sometimes get out of
sync.  The AS thinks a subchannel is attached or listening, and the
multiplexer thinks it is hungup.  This mostly seems to happen when
there are two or more slave subchannels defined with user data fields,
and, and only one is attached.  When the other end of the connection
disconnects, sometimes, the multiplexer recognizes it, but the AS does
not.  So, a subsequent connect with that user call data gets the second
subchannel (to which no one is attaching), while the first subchannel
does not know it has been hungup.
