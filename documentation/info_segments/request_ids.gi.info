07/20/78  Request IDs

Request IDs are used to identify absentee, I/O daemon, and retrieval requests,
when using the commands that list, cancel, or move those requests.


Request ID format: A request ID is a decimal number based on the date and time
the request was originally entered. A long request ID is a 19-digit number of
the form: yymmddHHMMSS.UUUUUU, giving the year, month, day, hour, minute,
second, and 6-digit fractional second (i.e., number of microseconds) at which
the request was entered. It is expressed in GMT rather than local time, to
avoid having the IDs of all existing requests change twice a year at the
transition to or from daylight time.  A short request id is the "HHMMSS"
portion of the long ID. It is often sufficient to uniquely identify a request.
Commands that print request IDs print the short ID by default, and accept the
-long_id (-lgid) control argument as a request to print the long ID instead.


Request ID matching: The request listing, moving, and cancelling commands will
accept an ID argument of any length (with a decimal point being assumed to the
right of the last digit of none is given).  A request is considered to match
an ID argument if the digits of the ID argument are equal to the corresponding
digits of the request ID. Thus, more than one request can match an ID
argument.  The request moving and cancelling commands require than an ID
argument be long enough to uniquely identify a single request. The request
listing commands will list all requests matching an ID argument.
