10/20/86  trim_wordlist, twl

Syntax as a command:  twl path {dict_paths} {-control_args}


Function:  trims (deletes) all words in the specified wordlist segment
or MSF that are found in one or more Wordpro dictionaries.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the wordlist segment or MSF to be trimmed.  If
   path does not have the suffix wl, one is assumed; however, wl must
   be the last component of the segment name.
dict_paths
   are the pathnames of dictionaries to be searched in order.  If
   dict_paths does not have a suffix of dict, one is assumed; however,
   dict must be the last component of the dictionary segment name.  If
   no dict_paths are specified, the dictionaries in the dict search
   list are used.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the display of the number of words trimmed and the number
   of words remaining in the trimmed wordlist segment.
-exact_match, -exm
   trims only those words that match exactly a word found in a
   dictionary, i.e., no special processing is performed with respect to
   capitalization (see "Notes" below).
-temp_dir path, -td path
   path holds the temporary segment if the input file is an MSF.
   (Default is the process directory.)


Notes:  For each word processed, the dictionaries are searched in the
order specified or as defined in the dict search list.  Normally, when
a word is found in a dictionary, it is trimmed.  However, if the word
found has the no-trim attribute, then the word is not trimmed and no
more dictionaries are searched for this word.


When searching for a word in a dictionary, special processing of
capital letters is performed unless the -exact_match control argument
is specified.


Most words in a dictionary consist of all lowercase letters.  These
words match any representations of themselves that are either all
lowercase letters, all lowercase letters with a leading capital letter,
or all capital letters.


Words in a dictionary that have a leading capital letter only match
representations of themselves that have a leading capital letter or are
all capital letters.


Words in a dictionary that consist of all capital letters or mixed
lowercase and capital letters only match representations of themselves
that have the identical capitalization.
