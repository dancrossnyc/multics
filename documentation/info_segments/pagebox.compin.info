11/30/86  pagebox.compin, midbox.compin

Syntax:  .ifi pagebox "box-header-lines"
      OR .ifi midbox  "box-header-lines"


Function:
These macros construct and place boxed headers as do the lXhbox.compin
and lXmhbox.compin macros.  They also create a level header and make a
TOC entry.  They are intended for use where the text in the boxed
header is different from that in the level header.  These macros
perform all functions of their lXh and lXmh counterparts.  See
l1hbox.compin.info and l1mhbox.compin.info for more information.


Examples:

   .ifi midbox "vfile_!checkpoint"
   .ifi l3mh "Name:  checkpoint"
