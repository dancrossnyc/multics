01/30/89  translator_info_

The translator_info_ subroutine contains utility routines needed by the
various system translators.  They are centralized here to avoid
repetitions in each of the individual translators.


Entry points in translator_info_:
(List is generated by the help command)


:Entry: get_source_info: 07/21/83  translator_info_$get_source_info


Function:  This entry point returns the information about a specified
source segment that is needed for the standard object segment:  storage
system location, date-time last modified, unique ID.


Syntax:
declare translator_info_$get_source_info entry (ptr, char(*), char(*),
     fixed bin(71), bit(36) aligned, fixed bin(35));

call translator_info_$get_source_info entry (source_ptr, dir_name,
     entryname, date_time_mod, unique_id, code);


Arguments:
source_ptr
   is a pointer to the source segment about which information is
   desired.  (Input)
dir_name
   is a pathname of the directory in which the source segment is
   located.  (Output)
entryname
   is the primary name of the source segment.  (Output)


date_time_mod
   is the date-time modified of the source segment as obtained from the
   storage system.  (Output)
unique_id
   is the unique ID of the source segment as obtained from the storage
   system.  (Output)
code
   is a storage system status code.  (Output)


Notes on status code:
A status code of zero indicates that all information has been returned
normally.

A nonzero status code returned by this entry is a storage system status
code.  Because the interface to this procedure is a pointer to the
source segment, the presence of a nonzero status code probably
indicates that the storage system entry for the source segment has been
altered since the segment was initiated, i.e., the segment has been
deleted, or this process no longer has access to the segment.


Notes:
The entryname returned by this procedure is the primary name on the
source segment.  It is not necessarily the same name as that by which
the translator initiated it.


:Entry: component_get_source_info:
  01/30/88  translator_info_$component_get_source_info


Function:  This entry point returns the information about a specified
source program that is needed for the standard object program:  storage
system location, date-time last modified, unique ID.


Syntax:
declare translator_info_$component_get_source_info entry (ptr, char(*),
     char(*), char(*), fixed bin(71), bit(36) aligned, fixed bin(35));

call translator_info_$component_get_source_info (source_ptr, dir_name,
     entry_name, component_name, date_time_mod, unique_id, code);


Arguments:
source_ptr
   is a pointer to the source program about which information is
   desired.  (Input)
dir_name
   is a pathname of the directory in which the source segment is
   located.  (Output)
entry_name
   is the primary name of the source segment.  (Output)
component_name
   is the name of the archive component. If the source program is not
   a component of an archive, then this value is null "".  (Output)


date_time_mod
   is the date_time modified of the source program as obtained from the
   storage system.  (Output)
unique_id
   is the unique ID of the source segment as obtained from the storage
   system.  (Output)
code
   is a storage system status code.  (Output)


Notes on status code:
A status code of zero indicates that all information has been returned
normally.

A nonzero status code returned by this entry is a storage system status
code.  Because the interface to this procedure is a pointer to the
source program, the presence of a nonzero status code probably
indicates that the storage system entry for the source segment has been
altered since the segment was initiated, i.e., the segment has been
deleted, or this process no longer has access to the segment.


Notes:
The entryname returned by this procedure is the primary name on the
source segment.  It is not necessarily the same name as that by which
the translator initiated it.
