Syntax as a command:  els path {-control_args}


Function:  creates a listin segment from a lister segment.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister segment.  If the entryname suffix
   lister is not specified, then it is added.  A listin segment is
   created in the working directory with the same entryname as path,
   and with the entryname suffix lister changed to listin.  Any
   existing copy of this listin segment is overwritten.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   specifies that all field names are to be placed in the listin
   segment.  The default is to suppress field names for null fields.
-line_length N, -ll N specifies that the line length of the ASCII
   listin segment is to be N characters.  If this control argument is
   not specified, then only one field is placed on each line.  A field
   is placed on a new line only if adding the field to the current line
   would exceed the specified line length.  At least one field is
   placed on each line.
-totals, -tt
   displays the number of records expanded.


Notes:  The ASCII listin segment created by this command has the
following format:

   The first two lines specify the record and field delimiter
   characters.


   Beginning on the third line are the field names.  They are separated
   by a comma and a space.  A field name is placed at the beginning of
   a new line if adding it to the current line would exceed the
   specified line length.


   Each record begins with a line containing just the record delimiter
   character.


   Unless -line_length is specified, each field is placed on a separate
   line and indented one space.


The expand_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the expansion is not performed or the
invocation of expand_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 0 is
set when the expansion is successfully performed and the command
terminates normally.
