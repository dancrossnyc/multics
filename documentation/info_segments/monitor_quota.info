03/08/82  monitor_quota

Syntax:  monitor_quota  {-control_args}


Function: calculates storage of a directory and will send a warning
message at the approach of a record quota overflow condition.


Control arguments: 
-call STR {N}
   specifies that STR is to be passed to the command processor as a
   command when a directory's segment quota used is found to be
   greater then 90 percent of the quota assigned.  If N is given then
   the default of 90 percent will be overridden.  (See Notes below.)
-console {N}
   sends a warning of an approaching record quota overflow condition
   to the system console.  Access to the phcs_ gate is required to
   issue warnings on the system console.  If N is specified then the
   default percent value at which the warning is to be issued will be
   overridden.
-off
   turns off all monitoring completely in this process.  This control
   argument must not be given with any other arguments.


-pathname, -pn
   specifies the pathname of the directory to be monitored. Only one 
   path may be given when invoked. The default is the user's working 
   directory.
-repeat DT, -rpt DT
   identifies the interval to set the monitor time to.  This argument
   will override the default time calculation.  The DT is a relative
   time >= 1 minute and acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_.
-print, -pr
   provides a list of directories being monitored and control
   information on the selected directories.
-warn User_ids {N}
   sends the warning message to the individual specified in
   User_id.  A limit of ten users may be listed with the
   use of this control argument.  The invoking user will be sent a
   message by default if this control argument and -console is
   omitted.  If N is specified then the default percent value at which
   the warning is to be issued will be overridden.


Notes: This command can be used several times in a process to monitor
several different directories.  Use of the -off control argument stops
monitoring of all directories.

The number of records given with the -call, -console and -warn {N}
control argument must be less then the quota assigned to the
directory.

The default interval when invoked without the -repeat control argument
will automatically be set with a time interval dependent on how much
available storage was found.  That is, if the directory was 50% full,
then an alarm would be set to trigger in 30 minutes to check again.
If the quota was found to be at 80% then a message would be sent and
an alarm time of 2 minutes would be set.  At 90% it would send a
warning every minute, and if -call has been provided, then the
specified string will be passed to the command processor.
