pg 3-3:  under the section CURRENT TRANSACTION, add the following |
     to the end of the first paragraph:                           |
                                                                  |
     When you enter a meeting, the current transaction is         |
     initially set to the last seen transaction that has not been |
     deleted or expunged.  If there is no seen transaction in the |
     meeting, "current" will then be set to the first non_deleted |
     transaction.                                                 |


pg 3-4:  under the RELATIVE ORDER KEYWORDS section, update        |
     'current' with the following:                                |
                                                                  |
     current, c                                                   |
         refers to a transaction that was affected by list,       |
         print, write or reset.                                   |


pg 3-5:  in the section SEEN/UNSEEN TRANSACTIONS, update the      |
     keywords 'last_seen' and 'last_unseen" with the following:   |
                                                                  |
     last_seen                                                    |
         refers to the highest-numbered transaction marked as     |
         having been seen.                                        |
                                                                  |
     last_unseen                                                  |
         refers to the highest-numbered transaction not marked as |
         having been seen.                                        |


pg 7-17:  under the NOTES section of the 'delete' request, add    |
     the following:                                               |
                                                                  |
     If there are no more non_deleted transactions left after the |
     old current transaction, "current", is set to the last       |
     un-deleted transaction.                                      |     


pg 7-47:  under the '-meeting' control argument for 'reply', add  |
     the following:                                               | 


     The subject will be the subject of the transaction to which  |
     the user is replying.  As forum does not chain transactions  |
     across meetings, the transaction which is created in the     |
     meeting_name meeting will not be chained to anything even    |
     though it has a header which is of the standard "Re:         |
     <subject>" format.  If the user enters the same request      |
     multiple times, the resulting transactions will not be       |
     chained together, although they will all have the same       |
     title.  Note that if a user subsequently attends the         |
     meeting_name meeting and replys to any of the transactions   |
     posted from the first meeting, the user's reply will be      |
     chained to the transaction number in the meeting_name        |
     meeting to which he replied.                                 |


pg 8-2:  add the following control argument to the 'forum'        |
     command:                                                     |
                                                                  |
     -auto_write                                                  |
         specifes that the qedx request automatically updates the |
         message when the user quits the editor.                  |


pg 8-3:  add the following control argument to 'forum' command:   |
                                                                  |
     -no_auto_write                                               |
         specifes that the qedx request requires the user to use  |
         the 'write' request to update the message before         |
         quitting the editor.  Any attempt to exit without        |
         writing results in a query.                              |
