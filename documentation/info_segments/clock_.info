:Entry: clock_:  01/28/82  clock_


Function: reads the system clock and returns a fixed binary number
equal to the number of microseconds since 0000 hours Greenwich mean
time January 1, 1901.  The returned time is suitable for input to the
date_time_ or decode_clock_value_ subroutines, which convert the clock
reading to an ASCII representation.


Syntax:
declare clock_ entry returns (fixed bin(71));
date_time = clock_ ();


Arguments:
date_time
   is the number of microseconds since January 1, 1901, 0000 hours
   Greenwich mean time.  (Output)


Notes:  The clock PL/I builtin function should be used in PL/I programs
instead of this subroutine, because it is more efficient.
