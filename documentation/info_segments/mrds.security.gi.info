Introduction: This is a brief description of the procedures needed to
make use of either relation or attribute level security within MRDS.


List of definitions:
database administrator (DBA)
   a user holding sma access on the database directory.
secure submodel
   a version 5 submodel residing in the secure.submodels directory
   under the database.
secured database
   a database modified by the secure_mrds_db command.  It remains
   secured until the secure_mrds_db -reset option is used.


Relation level security:
Control of access to the database data on a relation level is done
via Multics access control lists (ACLs).


To set access for a user to relation personnel under database
employee.db the following access must be set:

   employees.db>db_model needs r User_id

   employees.db>db.control needs rw User_id

   employees.db>personnel.m needs r User_id

   employees.db>personnel needs X User_id
     (where X is the desired relation data access of n, r, or rw)

User_id in the above commands gives the person.project to whom access
is being granted.


Attribute level security:
Control of access to the database data at attribute level requires
the use of a secure submodel on a secured database for non-DBA's.
The Multics ACLs must be set up as for relation access control.
However the secure submodel must have access control statements that
specify the additional attribute access, so MRDS may manage the
additional access restrictions above those applied by the Multics
ACLs.


For example, if the salary attribute in the above personnel relation
is to be given null access for the Benefits project, the following
could be done:

Create the submodel source:
   relation: personnel(last_name first_name address salary) ;
   attribute access: salary in personnel (null) ;

Use the command create_mrds_dsm -install on this submodel source.

Then give the Benefits project read access on the resulting submodel,
and only that submodel.

Then when a user in Benefits accesses the employee database, he will
not be able to read salary.
