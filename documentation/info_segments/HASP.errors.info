Description

0017  phx19286
 The calls to iodd_msg_ in hasp_ws_sim_driver_ which report errors
 returned by receive_file_ have the code and program name arguments
 inverted.

 If tty_area runs out of room while setting up a HASP multiplexer,
 the system will crash as priv_hasp_mpx's area handler will fault.

0014  phx17682
 If Multics is sending output (print/punch files) to a workstation at
 full speed (i.e., data is always ready to transmit whenever the
 workstation asks for the next block of data) and the workstation
 wishes to send an input file to Multics, the workstation will not
 start sending data until after any output from Multics has ceased
 (i.e., at the end of the print/punch file).  However, if the
 workstation has already started sending input before Multics starts
 sending its output, data will flow in both directions simultaneously.

 This problem is caused by the algorithm used to build output blocks in
 Multics.  When the workstation is ready to send an input file, it will
 first send a special Request-To-Send (RTS) record to Multics.  The
 workstation will then wait for an acknowledgement to the RTS record
 before starting to send the file.  Multics, however, will not send the
 RTS acknowledgement unless there is no data waiting to be output.
 Multics does not include the RTS acknowledgement record in a block
 with other data because there are workstations which will not
 recognize this record unless it is the only record in a data block.

 Multics should be changed to give priority to RTS acknowledgement
 records over normal data records.

0011  
 The ++PASSWORD control record should be supported to provide some
 small level of security on returned data files.  (The ability to use
 a blank password should also be allowed.)

 Failure to load (automatically or in response to load_mpx) should
 issue a "Load failed" error message rather than "Crash signalled".
 The error message documentation for this new message could then
 explain the various interactions with configuration parameters (eg:
 connect_timeout) that can cause load to fail.

0006  
 Ring-0 will occasionaly send the end of one block and the beginning of
 the next block in response to a SEND_OUTPUT from the FNP.  This will
 cause the FNP to report a malformatted BISYNC block to ring-0 which
 then crashes the multiplexer.  This is an extremely rare occurence.

0005  
 The multiplexer generates a spurious INPUT_AVAILABLE interrupt for a
 subchannel when there is actually no input present.  This behavior can
 cause applications (such as IMFT) to block forever on input or timeout
 at inappropriate times.

0004  phx16125
 Blocks can be transmitted out of sequence.  (Ie:  the system will send
 block N+1 when the remote host or workstation is expecting block N).
