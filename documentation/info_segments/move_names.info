02/15/85  move_names

Syntax as a command:
   move_names from_path1 {to_path1...from_pathN to_pathN}


Function: moves all the names but the one used to designate the entry
from one entry (directory, segment, multisegment file, data management
file, extended entry, or link) to another.  To copy the alternate
names, see copy_names.


Arguments:
from_pathi
   is the pathname of the entry whose names are to be moved.  The star
   convention is not allowed.
to_pathi
   is the pathname of the entry to which names on from_pathi are to be
   moved.  The equal convention is allowed.  If you omit the last
   to_path, the entry with the same name as from_path in your working
   directory is assumed.
