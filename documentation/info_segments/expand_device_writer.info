07/12/84  expand_device_writer, xdw

Syntax as a command:  xdw {path} {-control_args}


Function:  The expand_device_writer command is used to invoke the
Expander to expand an expansion input file into an expansion output
file.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the expansion input file.  The entryname of this
   file must have the suffix xdw, but the suffix need not be given in
   the command line.  By default, the expanded expansion output file is
   written to a segment in the working directory whose name is formed
   by stripping the suffix from the input file entryname.
   Multi-segment files and the star convention are not supported.  If
   no pathname is given, input may be given to the Expander by using
   the -input_string control argument.


Control arguments:
-arguments ..., -ag ...
   all remaining parameters in the command line are arguments to be
   passed to the file or input string being expanded.
-brief, -bf
   does not display the expansion usage list when the expansion is
   complete.  (Default)
-call command_line
   if there are no errors in processing, executes the given command
   line when the expansion is complete.
-input_string string, -instr string
   expands the given string as an expansion input file.  By default,
   the expansion is displayed and no expanded output file is created.


-long, -lg
   displays the expansion usage list when the expansion is complete.
-output_file path, -of path
   writes the expanded output into the segment with the given pathname.
   This forces no_print even if -print is also given.
-no_print, -npr
   does not display the resulting expansion.  This is the default when
   path is given and is forced when -output_file is given.
-print, -pr
   dislays the resulting expansion.  This is the default
   when -input_string is given and is mutually exclusive with
   -output_file.
