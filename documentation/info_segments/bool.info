Syntax:  bool B1 B2 B3


Syntax as active function:  [bool B1 B2 B3]


Function:  performs bit string operations on character string
representations of bit strings.


Arguments:
B1, B2, and B3
   are bit strings entered as 0 and 1 characters.

   B3 must be four bits long.  It causes the following logical
   operations to be performed on B1 and B2.

   B3        Name                Result
   --        ----                ------
   0000      clear               all zeroes
   0001      and                 B1 & B2
   0010                          B1 &^B2
   0011      move B1             B1
   0100                          ^B1 & B2
   0101      move B2             B2


   0110      xor                 (B1&^B2) | (^B1&B2)
   0111      or                  B1 | B2
   1000      ^or                 ^(B1|B2) = (^B1&^B2)
   1001      ^xor                ^((B1&^B2) | (^B1&B2)) = (^B1|B2) &
			     (B1|^B2)
   1010      invert B2           ^B2
   1011                          ^(^B1&B2) = (B1|^B2)
   1100      invert B1           ^B1
   1101                          ^(B1&^B2) = (^B1|B2)
   1110      ^and                ^(B1&B2) = (^B1|^B2)
   1111      ^clear              all ones


Notes:  The shorter of the two strings is extended at the right with
zeroes to equal the length of the longer string.
