Syntax:  mssa path mode1 access_name1 ... modeN access_nameN


Function:  adds entries to the access control list (ACL) of a message
segment.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a message segment.  The ms suffix is assumed.
   The star convention is allowed.
modei
   is the access to be given.  It can consist of any or all of the
   letters adros or it can be null, n, or "" to denote null access.
access_namei
   is an access control name.  It must be of the form
   Person_id.Project_id.tag.  If all three components are present, the
   ACL entry is searched for an entry by that name.  If one is found,
   the access is changed.  Otherwise, a new ACL entry is added.  If one
   or more components are missing from the access control name, the
   access is changed on all entries that match the access control name.
