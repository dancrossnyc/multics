Syntax as a command:  rle virtual_pointer


Function: satisfies the linkage fault taken when a process encounters
a linkage error by locating the virtual pointer specified as an
argument and patching the linkage information of the process.  When you
issue the start command, the process continues as if the original
linkage fault had located the specified virtual pointer.


Arguments:

when the start command is issued the process continues as if the
original linkage fault had located the specified virtual pointer.
