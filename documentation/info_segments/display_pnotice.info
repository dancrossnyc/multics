01/03/83	display_pnotice

Syntax:  display_pnotice path {control_arg}


Function: The display_pnotice command is used to provide information
on software protection notices contained in source programs.  By
default, the primary names of protection notices are printed instead
of the entire notice text.  Archives of source code programs may be
audited for protection notices using this command if path includes the
full archive name.  If a source module does not contain any notices,
or contains conflicting notices (e.g., copyright and trade secret), an
error message is emitted.  A warning message is also printed if there
is an imbedded notice found in a source program (protection notices
should be the first comment encountered).


Arguments:
path
   This is the full or relative pathname of the source language module.
   The language suffix must be included, or the archive suffix if an
   entire archive is to be processed.  The archive pathname convention
   is supported.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   If this control argument is used, the full text of notices found
   will be displayed.

-brief, -bf
    This is the default. Instead of text of notices found, the primary
    name of notices, without the "pnotice" suffix, is printed.
