07/11/86  Event channels

Event channels can be thought of as numbered slots in the interprocess
communication facility tables.  Each channel is either an event-wait,
event-call, or asynchronous event-call channel.  An event-wait channel
receives events that are merely marked as having occurred and awakens
the process if it is blocked waiting for an event on that channel.  On
an event-call channel, the occurrence of an event causes a specified
procedure to be called if (or when) the process is blocked waiting for
an event on any channel.  On an asynchronous event-call channel, the
occurrence of an event causes a specified procedure to be called
whether or not the process is blocked.  Naturally, the specific event
channel must be made known to the process that expected to notice the
event.  For an event to be noticed by an explicitly cooperating
process, the event channel identifier value is typically placed in a
known location of a shared segment.  For an event to be noticed by a
system module, a subroutine call is typically made to the appropriate
system module.  A process can go blocked waiting for an event to occur
or can explicitly check to see if it has occurred.  If an event occurs
before the target process goes blocked, then it is immediately awakened
when it does go blocked.


The user can operate on an event channel only if his ring of execution
is the same as his ring when the event channel was created.

The ipc_ subroutine is used as the primary interface to the Multics
interprocess communication facility.  The hcs_$wakeup entry point is
used to wake up a blocked process for a specified event.


Invoking an Event-Call Procedure: When a process is awakened on an
event-call channel, control is immediately passed to the procedure
specified by the input arguments to the ipc_$create_event_channel entry
point.  The procedure is called with one argument, a pointer to the
following structure.  This structure is declared in
event_call_info.incl.pl1.


dcl 1 event_call_info     based aligned  (event_call_info_ptr),
      2 channel_id        fixed bin(71),
      2 message           fixed bin(71),
      2 sender            bit(36),
      2 origin,
        3 dev_signal      bit(18) unaligned,
        3 ring            fixed bin(17) unaligned,
      2 data_ptr          ptr;


Structure elements:
   channel_id
      is the identifier of the event channel.
   message
      is an event message as specified to the hcs_$wakeup entry point.
   sender
      is the process identifier of the sending process.
   dev_signal
      indicates whether the event occurred as the result of an I/O
      interrupt.
      "1"b yes
      "0"b no
   ring
      is the sender's validation level.
   data_ptr
      points to further data to be used by the called procedure.


Notes: A user should be familiar with interprocess communication in
Multics and the pitfalls of writing programs that can run
asynchronously within a process.  For example, if a program does run
asynchronously within a process and it does input or output with the
tty_ I/O module, then the program should issue the start control order
of tty_ before it returns.  This is necessary because a wakeup from
tty_ may be intercepted by the asynchronous program.

If a program establishes an event-call channel, and the procedure
associated with the event-call channel uses static storage, then the
event-call procedure should have the perprocess_static attribute.
This is not necessary if the procedure is part of a limited subsystem
in which run units cannot be used.  See the description of the run
command for more information on run units and perprocess_static.
