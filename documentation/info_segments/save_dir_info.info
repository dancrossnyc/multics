10/17/84  save_dir_info

Syntax as a command:  save_dir_info dir_path {seg_path}


Function:  creates a segment containing all information available from
the storage system about a directory and its contents.


Arguments:
dir_path
   is the pathname of the directory to be scanned.
seg_path
   is the pathname of the directory information segment to be created.
   If you omit seg_path, the entryname portion of dir_path is assumed.
   If seg_path does not end with the dir_info suffix, it is assumed.


Notes:  This command is not recursive; the entire subtree inferior to
the selected directory is not scanned, just the immediately inferior
branches and links.  The saved information segment can be processed by
the comp_dir_info and list_dir_info commands.
