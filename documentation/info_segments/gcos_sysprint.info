07/25/84  gcos_sysprint, gsp

Syntax as a command:  gsp input_path {output_path} {-control_arg}


Function:  The gcos_sysprint command converts a print file (either
SYSOUT or simulated printer) produced by the GCOS environment simulator
from GCOS ASCII or BCD to Multics ASCII for printing or viewing on a
terminal.  This command is called automatically by the simulator to
convert any print files produced by the job, unless the -hold option is
given on the gcos command line.  It can also be called by the user to
convert a file that was not converted automatically.


Arguments:
input_path
   is the pathname of a print file produced by the simulator.
output_path
   is the pathname of a file into which the ASCII output lines are to
   be written.  If the file already exists, it is overwritten with no
   warning.  If output_path is omitted, the lines are displayed on the
   user's terminal as they are converted.


Control arguments:
-lower_case, -lc
   translates alphabetic characters to lowercase ASCII.  (Default is
   uppercase)


Notes:  The star and equal conventions are not implemented in this
command.

If the first record in the file is the SYSOUT header record written by
the simulator, then the records are ordered by report code (within each
activity) before being printed, and all records from the execution
report are printed first.  Otherwise the records are printed in the
order in which they appear in the input file, with no sorting or
reordering of any kind.

The records are assumed to be GCOS print line images, ending with GCOS
printer control characters.  These latter are converted to ASCII
newline and newpage characters.  To convert a BCD card image file to
ASCII, with newline characters being added to the end of each line, use
the gcos_card_utility command.
