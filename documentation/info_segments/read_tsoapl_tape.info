:Info: read_tsoapl_tape: rtt:  1980-03-06  read_tsoapl_tape, rtt

Syntax as a command:  rtt tapename {filenames} {-control_arg}


Function: reads an IBM APL SELDUMP (or DUMP) tape, containing saved APL
workspaces, into segments in the working directory.  The segments are
given the name of the saved workspace, with the suffix "libN.sv.tsoapl"
added, where N is the library number of the workspace.


Arguments:
tapename
   is the slot number of the tape

filenames
   are optional names of workspaces on the tape to be read.
   The default is to read in all workspaces.


Control arguments:
-attach_description XX, -atd XX
   Use XX as the attach description.  The default attach description is
   "tape_nstd_ tapename -bk 10000".

-density XX, -den XX
   Use XX as the density setting. XX must be 200, 556, 800, or 1600.
   The default is 1600.

-list, -ls
   List the names of the workspaces only. The default is to list
   and read the workspaces.


Notes: The user must have rw permission on the segment
>sc1>rcp>workspace.acs, in order to get larger than normal tape
buffers (tapes created by IBM APL have 10,000 byte records, which is
larger than the default buffer size).

Since Multics permits only ASCII characters in segment names, any
delta characters in the workspace name are translated to "d", and any
underlined delta characters are translated to "D".
