06/04/82	program_interrupt, pi

Syntax:  pi


Function: informs a suspended invocation of a subsystem that the user
wishes to abort the current request.


Notes: The program interrupt command is used with interactive
subsystems.  Interactive subsystems are commands that accept user
requests from the terminal.  To abort a subsystem request the user
uses the quit (or break) key to interrupt execution, and then gives
the program_interrupt command.  If the subsystem supports the use of
the program_interrupt command, it will abort the interrupted request
and ask the user for a new one.  If the subsystem does not support the
use of program_interrupt, the command will print an error message.
The user may then either restart the interrupted operation with the
"start" command, or abort the entire subsystem invocation with the
"release" command.
