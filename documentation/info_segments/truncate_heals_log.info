02/17/84  truncate_heals_log

Syntax:  truncate_heals_log N
       or
         truncate_heals_log {-control_args}


Function:  deletes records from >system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log.
It is used with the update_heals_log command.


Arguments:
N
   is the number of days, counted back from the current time, for which
   messages are to remain in the HEALS log.


Control arguments:
-from DT, -fm DT
   starts deleting messages from the specified date/time.  If omitted,
   a clock value of 0 is assumed; that is, the truncate_heals_log
   command starts deleting messages from the beginning of the log.
-to DT
   stops deleting messages from the specified date/time.  If omitted, a
   clock value equal to the current time is assumed.


Notes:  You must have rw access to the heals_log and heals_log_info
segments, both located in >system_control_1>heals_dir, in order to
delete messages from the HEALS log.

The date/times following the control arguments must be in a form
acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_ (see the Subroutines manual).
