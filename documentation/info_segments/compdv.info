07/11/84  compdv

Syntax as a command:  compdv path {-control_args}


Function:  The compdv command is used to invoke the Device Table
Compiler to translate a device description file into a binary table
for use by the Formatter.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the input device description file.  The entryname
   of the file must end with the suffix compdv, but the suffix need not
   be given in the command.  The output segment is created (if it does
   not already exist) in the working directory with an entryname formed
   by replacing the suffix compdv with comp_dsm.  Multisegment files
   and the star convention are not supported.


Control arguments:
-check, -ck
   processes the input file, making all syntax checks and creating the
   ALM source intermediate file, but do not invoke the ALM assembler
   and do not delete the ALM source file.  The default is to invoke the
   ALM assembler at the end of an error-free translation and to delete
   the ALM source file.
-list, -ls
   create an ALM assembly output listing for the translation.  The
   default is no listing.
