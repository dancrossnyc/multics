01/14/87 dial_manager_call

Syntax as a command:  dial_manager_call request {STR1 {STR2} {STR3}}


Function:  provides a command interface to the answering service's dial
facility.  All functions that are available through the dial_manager_
subroutine interface are available through this command.


Arguments:
request
   maps into a call to an identically named entry in dial_manager_.
   Each request requires the use of a particular STR, which is listed
   in the request description.  A request must be one of the following:
   allow_dials STR, ad STR
      requests that the answering service establish a dial line to
      allow terminals to dial to the calling process.  STR must be a
      dial_qualifier as described below.
   dial_out STR1 STR2 {STR3}, do STR1 STR2 {STR3}
      requests that an auto call channel be dialed to a given telephone
      number and, if the channel is successfully dialed, that the
      channel be assigned to the requesting process.  STR1 must be a
      channel_name and STR2 must be a dial_out_destination as described
      below.  STR3, which can be omitted, is a reservation_string as
      described below.
   privileged_attach STR, pa STR
      allows a privileged process to attach any terminal that is in the
      channel master file, and is not already in use.  (See the
      description of dial_manager_$privileged_attach for information on
      what access is required.)  The effect is as if that terminal had
      dialed to the requesting process.  STR must be a channel_name as
      described below.
   registered_server STR, rs STR
      requests that the answering service allow terminals to dial the
      calling process using only the dial qualifier.  STR must be a
      dial_qualifier as described below.
   release_channel STR, rc STR
      requests the answering service to release the channel specified
      by channel_name.  This channel must be dialed to the caller at
      the time of the request.  If the channel was dialed, the channel
      is returned to the answering service and another access request
      may be issued.  If the channel is a slave channel, the channel is
      hung up.  STR must be a channel_name as described below.
   release_channel_no_hangup STR, rcnh STR
      is the same as release_channel except that this request does not
      hang up slave channels.  STR must be a channel_name as described
      below.
   release_dial_id STR, rdi STR
      informs the answering service that your process wishes to prevent
      further dial connections, but that existing connections should be
      kept.  You can release later any connections kept with the
      release_channel request.  STR must be a dial_qualifier as
      described below.
   shutoff_dials STR, sd STR
      informs the answering service that your process wishes to prevent
      further dial connections and that existing connections should be
      terminated.  STR must be a dial_qualifier as described below.
   start_report, start
      turns on the reporting feature (see "Notes" below).
   stop_report, stop
      turns off the reporting feature (see "Notes" below).
   terminate_dial_out STR, tdo STR
      requests that the answering service hang up an auto call line and
      unassign it from the requesting process.  STR must be a
      channel_name as described below.
STR
   depends on the request.  STR is selected from the following list.
   (For details on the interpretation of the following qualifiers see
   the dial_manager_ subroutine.)
   channel_name
      is the name of a tty_channel.
   dial_qualifier
      is the name for which you are to be a dial server.
   dial_out_destination
      is the destination (e.g., phone number) of up to 32 characters.
   reservation_string
      is a dial_manager_ reservation string of up to 256 characters.


Notes:  This command establishes an event call channel for
communication with the answering service.  This event channel and its
handler (which is an entry point in dial_manager_call) remain active
after the command terminates.  Any events following the command
termination, such as channel hang-ups, dial-ups, and dial requests are
decoded using convert_dial_message_ and reported on the user_output I/O
switch when they happen.  You can turn this reporting feature on (the
default) and off by using the start_report and stop_report requests.

When the destination specifies an X.25 address you can optionally
precede it with "*" or "x29," to indicate that an X.29 (PAD) call
should be made.  For example, a destination of

      x29,3106:mitmul or
      *3106:mitmul

specifies an X.29-type call on TYMNET.
