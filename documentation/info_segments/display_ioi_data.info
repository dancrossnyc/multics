Syntax:  display_ioi_data {-control_args}


Function: displays control blocks in the ring-0 database ioi_data.  It
can be used on a running system, an fdump, or a copy of ioi_data made
with the copy_out command (see the System Dump Analysis PLM, Order
No. AN53).


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   causes all the channel table entries and device table entries
   associated with the group(s) selected to be displayed.  It can be
   used with -group or -gte.
-force, -fc
   forces the display of certain control block and/or fields that the
   command might not otherwise display.
-header, -he
   causes the ioi_data header to be displayed.  This is the default if
   no control blocks are selected.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses the display of the ioi_header.  This is the default when
   a control block is selected.


Control arguments for selecting: The following select where ioi_data is
   to be found.  Only one control argument can be selected from this
   list.  If none are specified, ioi_data is copied from ring-0 of the
   running system.
-erf erfno
   specifies the number of the fdump to be analyzed.
-segment path, -sm path
   specifies the pathname of the segment containing ioi_data.
   Normally, this segment is obtained from the running system using the
   copy_out command or from an fdump using the extract command.


Control arguments for displaying: The following specify which control
   blocks in ioi_data are to be displayed.  Only one control argument
   can be selected from the following list.  If none are specified,
   all control blocks are displayed.
-channel {channel_name}, -chn {channel_name}
   displays the channel table entry (cte) for the channel specified.
   If channel name is ommitted, all cte's are displayed.  The channel
   name argument is in the form {tag}number, where tag is an IOM tag
   (a thru h) and number is an octal channel number.  If tag is
   omitted, IOM a is assumed.
-cte {octal_offset}
   displays the cte at iom_data|octal_offset.  If offset is omitted,
   all cte's are displayed.


-device {device_name}, -dv {device_name}
   displays the device table entry (dte) for the device specified.  If
   device_name is omitted, all dte's are displayed.
-dte {octal_offset}
   displays the dte at iom_data|octal_offset.  If offset is omitted,
   all dte's are displayed.
-group {device_name}, -gp {device_name}
   displays the group table entry (gte) for the device specified.  If
   device_name is omitted, all gte's are displayed.
-gte {octal_offset}
   displays the gte at iom_data|octal_offset.  If offset is omitted,
   all gte's are displayed.
-user {Person_id.Project_id}
   displays the dte's of all devices assigned to the specified user.
   If Person_id.Project_id is omitted, your Person_id is assumed.
   Either Person_id or Project_id can be omitted or an asterisk (*)
   can be used in their place.
