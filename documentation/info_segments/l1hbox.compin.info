11/30/86  l1hbox.compin, l2hbox.compin, l3hbox.compin, l4hbox.compin

Syntax:  .ifi lXhbox "paragraph-title"


Function:
These macros perform all the functions of their lXh.compin counterparts
with the addition of constructing a boxed page header for those
'paragraph-titles' that would not automatically get one because of
their format.


Notes:
Entry points have been defined for the generation of
multiline page and mid-page boxed headers, namely:

   l(1 2 3 4)hbox boxed page header ONLY
   l(1 2 3 4)mhbox boxed page and mid-page header

If you enter;

     .ifi l1hbox "First Line!Second Line!....!Last Line"

will generate the page header;

------------                            ----------
First Line			First Line
Second Line			Second Line
...				        ...
Last Line				Last Line
------------			-----------
