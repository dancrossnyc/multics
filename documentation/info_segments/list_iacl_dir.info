10/17/84  list_iacl_dir, lid

Syntax as a command:  lid {path} {User_ids} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [lid {path} {User_ids} {-control_args}]


Function:  lists some or all the entries on a directory initial access
control list (initial ACL) of a specified directory.


Arguments:
path
   specifies the directory in which the directory initial ACL should be
   listed.  If path is -working_directory (-wd) or omitted, your
   working directory is assumed; if omitted, you can't specify
   User_ids.  The star convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   access names matching the given User_ids are listed.  If you don't
   give User_id, the entire initial ACL is listed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "User name not on ACL of path."  If you
   invoke lid as an active function and User_id is not on the initial
   ACL, the null string is returned.
-chase
   chases links matching a star name.  The default is to chase a link
   only when specified by a nonstarred pathname.
-no_chase
   does not chase links.
-ring N, -rg N
   identifies the ring number whose directory initial ACL is to be
   listed.  It can appear anywhere on the line and affects the whole
   line.  If present, follow it by N (where 0 <= N <= 7).  If omitted,
   your ring is assumed.


Access required:  You must have status permission on the containing
directory.


Notes:  If you invoke list_iacl_dir without any arguments, the entire
initial ACL for your working directory is listed.

A directory initial ACL contains the ACL entries to be placed on
directories created in the specified directory.

For information on initial ACLs, see the Programmer's Reference Manual.
For a description of the matching strategy for User_ids, see the
set_acl command.
