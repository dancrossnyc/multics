5/20/80  display_lisp_object_segment, dlos

Usage:   dlos pathname {-control_arg}


Function:  Displays to the terminal the top level forms and function
definitions in a Lisp or Lap object segment.  The top level forms are
those forms to be executed (evaluated) when the segment is loaded into
a Lisp environment.  The top level forms and names and types of
functions being defined are displayed in the order in which they will
be executed at load time.   The constants referenced by compiled code
can be displayed optionally, as well as subr and array link information.

     This command is intended to facilitate debugging of complex
compile-time and macro systems to ascertain whether or not they have
placed what they were desired to in the object segment being
compiled.


Arguments:
pathname
   Pathname of a Lisp (lcp) or Lap compiled object segment.  If this
   is the pathname of a bound segment, the entryname portion must be
   the same as the component name about which information is desired.
   This, of course, implies (as is the case for successful use of
   such segments with Lisp) that the component name is a name on the
   bound segment.


Control arguments:
-constants, -c
   Causes the list of constants referenced by compiled functions to
   be displayed.
-array_links, -al
   Causes the list of links to arrays referenced by compiled code to
   be displayed.  The compiled array type and number of dimensions is
   printed as well.
-subr_links, -links, -link, -lk
   Causes the list of functions referenced by compiled code to be
   displayed.  The compiled number of arguments and assumed function
   type is displayed as well.
-long, -lg, -all, -a
   Equivalent to -array_links -subr_links -constants.
