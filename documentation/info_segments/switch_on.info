05/13/88  switch_on, swn

Syntax as a command:  swn keyword paths {-control_args}


Function:  turns on a specified switch for one or more
entries--directory, segment, multisegment file (MSF), data mangement
(DM) file, and extended entry.  For an MSF, the switch of the MSF
directory (when possible) and those of all the components are turned
on.


Arguments:
keyword
   specifies the name of a switch (see "List of Keywords" below).
paths
   are the pathnames of entries for which it is possible to set the
   specified switch.  You can use the star convention, which includes
   links only if you give -chase.  You can specify by "-name STR" a
   pathname that looks like a control argument or contains starname
   special characters not meant to be matched.


Control arguments:
-chase
   includes links and chases them when using the star convention.
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a pathname that looks like a control argument or contains
   starname special characters not meant to be matched.
-no_chase
   does not include links when using the star convention.  (Default)


List of keywords:
audit
   if ON, all accesses (successful or unsuccessful) of the entry will
   be audited.
copy_switch, csw
   if ON, allows processes lacking write access to modify a copy of the
   segment in the process directory.  (Segments)
complete_volume_dump_switch, cvds
   if ON, the entry is dumped during a complete volume dump of the
   physical volume on which it resides.
damaged_switch, dsw
   if ON, the segment is assumed to have been damaged by a device error
   or system crash.  (Segments)


incremental_volume_dump_switch, ivds
   if ON, the entry is dumped during an incremental dump cycle of the
   volume dumper.
perprocess_static_switch, ppsw
   if ON, the segment's internal static storage is not initialized when
   a run unit is created.  (Object segment)
safety_switch, ssw
   if ON, the delete command and delete_ subroutine query you before
   deleting the entry.
synchronized_switch
   if ON, writes out to disk the segment's pages only after
   corresponding pages in an associated before journal are written out.
   Only authorized users can set this switch.  (Segments)


Access required:  You require modify permission on the parent
directory.  Setting the audit switch requires access to the
system_privilege_ gate.


Notes:  The keywords can also include switches defined for particular
extended entry types (see describe_entry_type).
