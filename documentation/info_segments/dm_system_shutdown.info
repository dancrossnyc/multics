10/25/84 dm_system_shutdown

Syntax as a command:  dm_system_shutdown {-cargs}


Function:  This command schedules a Data Management system (DMS)
shutdown.  The DMS can be specified by the pathname of the its
per-system directory, i.e., the directory in which it resides.  By
default, the DMS which this process is currently using is scheduled to
be shut down.  Processes using the DMS are notified of the scheduled
shutdown via the dm_shutdown_scheduled_ IPS signal.


The system shutdown process consists of five events executed at the
following five points in time, usually, but not necessarily, in the
given order:

  1) At user-warning-time:
     a warning message is printed in each process using the
     DMS as follows:

     DM is shutting down; no new transactions will be allowed
     after 9:00.  Please use the dm_user_shutdown_command, or
     9:15, a forced shutdown will be done.  Shutdown
     reason:  {REASON}

  2) At begin-shutdown-time:
     the Data Management daemon puts the DMS in a state wherein
     no new transactions can be created.  This is considered the
     beginning of the DMS shutdown.


  3) At user-shutdown-time:
     for each user process still using the DMS, a DM user
     shutdown is executed in the process.  A message is printed
     informing the user, as follows:

     The Data Management system is shutting down; starting DM user
     shutdown.  Shutdown reason:  {REASON}

  4) At user-bump-time:
     the Data Management daemon bumps each process still using
     the DMS.

  5) At daemon-logout-time:
     the shutdown is made complete by logging out the Data
     Management daemon.


The time of each event is determined according to the following rules:

   1) If the time is specified with a control argument ending in
      "_time" the event is scheduled to occur at that time.

   2) Starting from each specified time, the times for
      subsequent events are calculated using the specified or
      default delays, until an event is reached which has a
      specified time.

   3) If the first event is not scheduled, then starting from
      the first specified time, calculate the times for previous
      events using specified or default delays, until the first
      event is reached.


   4) If no times are specified, the user-bump-time defaults to
      the scheduled Multics shutdown time, and other times are
      calculated from there.

   5) If no times are specified and there is no Multics shutdown
      scheduled, an error message is returned.


Control arguments:
-dm_system_directory PATH, -dmsd PATH
   is the pathname, PATH, of the DM per-system directory in which the
   DMS resides.  Several DMSs may reside in the DM per-system
   directory.  The one selected is the one for the current bootload at
   the AIM authorization of the caller.  If not specified, the default
   DMS is the DMS the process is currently using.  If not specified and
   the process is not currently using a DMS, an error message is
   printed and no action is performed.
-reason STRING
   is the reason, STRING, why the DMS is being shut down.  This reason
   is ultimately part of the messages received by users of the DMS.  If
   not specified, a prompt is issued for the reason.  STRING can be no
   longer than 64 characters.  STRING must be quoted if it contains
   whitespace.


-user_warning_time TIME, -uwtm TIME
   specifies the user-warning-time.  TIME may be absolute or relative
   to the time at which the dm_system_shutdown command is invoked.
   TIME must be acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.
   If no user-warning-time is specified, the default is to use the
   config file begin_shutdown_delay to determine the user-warning-time,
   calculating backwards in time.
-begin_shutdown_delay DELAY, -bsd DELAY
   specifies the time period between the user-warning-time and the
   begin-shutdown-time.  DELAY must be in a form acceptable to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If no begin-shutdown-time is
   specified, the default is to use the config file
   begin_shutdown_delay to determine the begin-shutdown-time.


-begin_shutdown_time TIME, -bstm TIME
   specifies the begin-shutdown-time.  TIME may be absolute or relative
   to the time at which the dm_system_shutdown command is invoked.
   TIME must be acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.
   If no begin-shutdown-time is specified, the default is to use the
   config file begin_shutdown_delay to determine the
   begin-shutdown-time.
-user_shutdown_delay DELAY, -usd DELAY
   specifies the time period between the begin-shutdown-time and the
   user-shutdown-time.  DELAY must be in a form acceptable to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If no user-shutdown-time is
   specified, the default is to use the config file user_shutdown_delay
   to determine the user-shutdown-time.


-user_shutdown_time TIME, -ustm TIME
   specifies the user-shutdown-time.  TIME may be absolute or relative
   to the time at which the dm_system_shutdown command is invoked.
   TIME must be acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.
   If no user-shutdown-time is specified, the default is to use the
   config file user_shutdown_delay to determine the user-shutdown-time.
-user_bump_delay DELAY, -ubd DELAY
   specifies the time period between the user-shutdown-time and the
   user-bump-time.  DELAY must be in a form acceptable to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If no user-bump-time is
   specified, the default is to use the config file user_bump_delay to
   determine the user-bump-time.
-user_bump_time TIME, -ubtm TIME
   specifies the user-bump-time.  TIME may be absolute or relative to
   the time at which the dm_system_shutdown command is invoked.  TIME
   must be acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If no
   times are specified via a -..._time control argument, the
   user-bump-time defaults to the scheduled Multics shutdown time.  If
   a time other than the user-bump-time is specified, the default is to
   use the config file user_bump_delay to determine the user-bump-time.


-daemon_logout_delay DELAY, -dld DELAY
   specifies the time period between the user-bump-time and the
   daemon-logout-time.  DELAY must be in a form acceptable to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If no daemon-logout-time is
   specified, the default is to use the config file daemon_logout_delay
   to determine the daemon-logout-time.
-daemon_logout_time TIME, -dltm TIME
   specifies the daemon-logout-time.  TIME may be absolute or relative
   to the time at which the dm_system_shutdown command is invoked.
   TIME must be acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.
   If no daemon-logout-time is specified, the default is to use the
   config file daemon_logout_delay to determine the daemon-logout-time.


   Access required:
   're' permission to dm_admin_gate_ is required to execute this
   command.
