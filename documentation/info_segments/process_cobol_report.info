Syntax: pcr path {-contol_args}


Function:  Extracts reports from a file created by a cobol program that
used the report writer feature.


Arguments:
path 
   is the pathname of the input file

Control arguments:
-report_code STR , -rcd STR
   specifies which report(s) are to be extracted from the
   report file.  STR consists of a string of report codes
   (the two character designators supplied in the code phrase
   of the cobol program) with values separated by commas with
   no spaces.  This control argument is incompatable with the
   the -all control argument.

-output_file path , -of path
   specifies that the output is to be directed to the file
   indicated by path. The default is for the output to be
   directed to user_output (terminal).

-all , -a
   specifies that all reports in the report file are to be processed.
   This control argument is incompatible with the -report_code control
   argument.

-no_newpage , -nnp
   specifies that newpage characters are not to be emitted when -output_file
   is used.  The default is for each page to end with a newpage character.

-stop , sp
   waits for a carriage return from the user before begining typing and after
   each page of output to the terminal.

Notes:
     When outputting to the terminal pcr assumes the terminal is
positioned to the top of a page.
     When neither -all nor -repot_code control arguments are specified,
then the report designated by the default code is processed.
