02/13/85  get_quota, gq

Syntax as a command:  gq {paths} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [gq {path} {-control_arg}]


Function: returns information about the secondary storage quota and
pages used by segments.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of directories for which you want quota information.
   If one of the paths is -working_directory (-wd), your working
   directory is used.  If you don't supply paths, your working
   directory is assumed.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   includes the cumulative time-page product for the current accounting
   period and the corresponding price according to the rate structure
   of the current process.
-nonzero, -nz
   lists directories with nonzero quota used only.
-quota
   returns the terminal quota on each directory.  (Default: to return
   terminal quota and number of pages used)


-records_left, -rec_left
   returns the number of available pages in each directory, equal to
   the terminal quota minus the pages used.  If a directory has no
   terminal quota set, the available pages are computed from the
   terminal quota on the lowest parent with nonzero terminal quota,
   minus the pages used under that parent with nonzero terminal quota.
-records_used, -rec_used
   returns the number of pages used in each directory.
-sort
   sorts directories by the requested quota value or by records used if
   you request more than one value.  The largest value is printed
   first.


-total, -tt
   returns, for quota used, the total quota used by the subtree.
   Master directories in a subtree are not included in its total.
-zero
   lists directories with zero quota used only.


Access required: You require status permission on each directory for
which you want quota.  Determining the value of -records_left may
require access further up the hierarchy.  If the required access is
lacking, an error message is printed.


Notes: The short form of output (the default) prints the number of
pages of quota used by the segments in that directory and in any
inferior directories charging against that quota.  The output is
prepared in tabular format, with a total, when you specify more than
one pathname; when you give only one, a single line of output is
printed.

The long form of output gives the quota and pages-used information
provided in the short output and prints the logical volume identifier
of segments, the time-record product in units of record days, and the
date you last updated this number; thus you can see what secondary
storage charges your accounts are accumulating.  If you have inferior
directories with nonzero quotas, you need print this product for all
these directories to obtain the charge.


Notes on active function: Supply only one directory in the active
function.  You can't use the star convention.

The active function doesn't accept -long, -nonzero, -sort, and -zero.

You can specify any of -quota, -records_left, or -records_used; the
default is -quota.
