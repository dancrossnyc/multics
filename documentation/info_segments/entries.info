Syntax as a command:  entries star_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [entries star_names {-control_args}]


Function: returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of segments,
directories, multisegment files (MSFs), links, data management (DM)
files, and extended entries that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_names
   are star names to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.
-chase
   will process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
-no_chase
   will not process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
   (Default)
-select_entry_type STR, -slet STR
   returns entrynames of entries of the specified types.  You need not
   give the suffix in the starname.  Use the list_entry_types command
   to obtain a list of valid entry type values. STR is a comma separated
   list of entry types, such as: mailbox,ms,mcacs.


Notes: Only one name per entry is returned; i.e., if an entry has more
than one name that matches a starname, only the first match found is
returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by entries is enclosed in
quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.

See the directories, directory, and entry commands.
