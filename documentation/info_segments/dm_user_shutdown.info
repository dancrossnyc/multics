02/12/85  dm_user_shutdown

Syntax as a command:  dm_user_shutdown


Function: removes the process invoking it from the current invocation
of the data management system (DMS).


Notes: All user process references to per-process and per-system data
are invalidated to permit subsequent reentry to DMS.  If a transaction
is in progress in the process when you issue the command, the DM Daemon
(Data_Management.Daemon) rolls it back automatically.

Normally all processes using data management are shut down as part of a
data management system shutdown, with no explicit user intervention.

This command is part of the command level interface to Multics data
management.  It is intended for use in a test environment or for
debugging purposes.
