02/06/84  day

Syntax:  day


Function: allows the accounting administrator to run, every night, a
self-rescheduling absentee job called the "crank".  It records the
daily charges of users and checks for users who should be cut off.
The day command prints the output from the crank on the terminal and
asks whether or not to delete the output.  Unless there was an error,
the absentee output segment should be deleted.
