10/17/84  release, rl

Syntax as a command:  rl {-control_arg}


Function:  releases the stack history that was automatically preserved
after an unclaimed or quit signal; that is, the Multics stack is
returned to a point immediately prior to the stack frame of the command
that was being executed when the most recent quit or unclaimed signal
occurred.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   releases the stack history preserved (and not already released)
   after all previous quit and/or unclaimed signals rather than after
   only the most recent quit or unclaimed signal.
