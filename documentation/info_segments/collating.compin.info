Syntax: .ifi collating  "copyright-year"
     OR .ifi coll_page  "copyright-year"
        .srv file_no    "Pubs-catalog-file-number"
        .srv add_letter "what-addendum"
        .srv add_date   "publish-date"
and at the top of the second page (to set the proper footers)
        .ifi coll_cont


Function:
When composed, this macro creates a collating page (or pages) for an
addendum to a manual.  It:
1) generates the heading, standard "remove and insert" sentence, and
   remove and insert column headings (see "Notes" below)
2) generates the proper footers for the first and succeeding pages


Arguments:
'copyright-year' is the copyright year (all 4 digits) for the addendum,
   not the manual.
'Pubs-catalog-file-number' is the file reference number given in the
   Publications Catalog.  (For Honeywell use, these numbers will be
   found in Table 1-3 in Part III, "Writing and Editing," of the
   Honeywell Publications Standards.)
'what-addendum' is a single capital letter, indicating which addendum
   this is (i.e., A is the first addendum; B, second; etc.).
'publish-date' is the month and year, in the form mm/yy, that this
   addendum is published (generally, "published" here means "brought to
   the printer").  Normally, leading zeros are not used, so a publish
   date of August 1978 would be 8/78 not 08/78.


Notes:
The column headings generated by this macro assume that the output of
the first column begins in character position 6 and the second column,
in character position 46.  Thus, the user's compin segment can easily
be done using the compose horizontal tab controls (see WORDPRO
Reference Guide, Section 4).


Examples:
The following compin segment

     .ifi init_mpm "AT58"
     .ifi collating "1978"
     .srv file_no "1L13"
     .srv add_letter "A"
     .srv add_date "8/78"
     .htd pages 6,46
     .htn > pages
     >iii through vii>iii through vii
     .spb
     >2-1 through 2-4>2-1, 2-2
     >>2-3, 2-3.1
     >>2-3.2, 2-4
     .spb
       .
       .
       .
     .htf >


produces the following compout

		    COLLATING INSTRUCTIONS

    To update the manual, remove old pages and insert new pages as
follows:

      Remove			      Insert

      iii through vii		      iii through vii

      2-1 through 2-4		      2-1, 2-2
				      2-3, 2-3.1
				      2-3.2, 2-4
