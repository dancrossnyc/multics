03/27/84  backup_preattach

Syntax:   backup_preattach open_mode attach_description
    or:   backup_preattach -detach


Function: attaches and detaches the I/O switch used by the backup_dump
and backup_load subsystems with a specified attach description, so
that input and output media or devices other than tapes may be used by
the backup subsystem.


Arguments:
open_mode
   is either "input" or "output", indicating the mode in which the
   switch will be opened (input for backup_load, output for
   backup_dump).
attach_description
   is an attach description for reading or writing the backup
   data. A switch with this attachment will be used by the backup
   subsystem.


Control arguments:
-detach
   Causes the previously pre-attached switch to be detached. The
   backup subsystem will revert to using tapes after -detach is
   specified.


Examples:  To create a vfile_ containing the image of a hierarchy and
then reload it somewhere else:
    backup_preattach output "vfile_ dump_file"
    backup_dump >udd>Project
    backup_preattach -detach
    backup_preattach input "vfile_ dump_file"
    backup_load
