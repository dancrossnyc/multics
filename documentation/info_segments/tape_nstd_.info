02/13/84  tape_nstd_


Syntax for attach description:
     tape_nstd_ reel_num {-control_args}


Function: The tape_nstd_ I/O module supports I/O to/from tapes in
nonstandard or unknown formats.  This module makes no assumptions
about the format of the tape and returns one logical record for each
physical record on the tape.  Since the information upon the tape,
including tape marks, is not interpreted by this I/O module, the user
must detect the logical end of information on the reel.  This I/O
module functionally replaces ntape_.

Entry points in the module are not called directly by users; rather,
the module is accessed through the iox_ subroutine.


Arguments:
reel_num
   is the tape reel number.


Control arguments:
block N, -bk N
   specifies the maximum record length, in bytes, for this attachment.
   The default value for N is 11200.  Values of N greater than 11888
   require access to either the >system_library_1>rcp_sys_ gate or
   >sc1>rcp>workspace.acs (see "Buffer Size" below).
-comment STR -com STR
   specifies a comment string that is displayed to the operator.  It
   can be used to give the operator any special instructions that are
   relevant to this attachment.  The comment string must be enclosed
   within quotes if it contains blanks or other spacing characters.
-density N, -den N
   specifies the initial density to be used for this attachment.
   Acceptable values for N are 200, 556, 800, 1600 and 6250; the
   default is 800 bpi.


-speed S1{,S2,...,SN}, -ips S1{,S2,...,SN}
   specifies desired tape drive speeds in inches per second, where Si
   can be 75, 125, or 200 inches per second.  (See "Device speed
   specification" below.)
-track N, -tk N
   means that the tape is N track.  Acceptable values for N are 7 and
   9.  If no track argument is supplied then 9 track is assumed.
-write
   means that the tape is to be mounted with a write ring.  This
   argument must occur if the I/O switch is to be opened for output or
   input/output.


Device speed specification:  The -speed control argument is used to
specify acceptable tape device speeds in inches per second.  The module
only attaches a device that matches a speed specified by this control
argument.  If more than one speed is specified, the module attaches a
device that matches one of the speeds.


Open operation:  The opening modes supported are sequential_input,
sequential_output, and sequential_input_output.  If an I/O switch
attached via the tape_nstd_ I/O module is to be opened for output or
input_output, the -write control argument must occur in the attach
description.


List of control orders:
backspace_file
   positions the tape before the file mark next encountered while
   rewinding the tape (if no file mark is encountered then the tape is
   left at load point).
backspace_record
   positions the tape before the previous record on the tape (or file
   mark if the current record is preceded by a file mark).
bcd
   sets hardware mode to binary coded decimal (BCD).  See "Hardware
   modes" below.
binary
   sets hardware mode to binary (this is the default).  See "Hardware
   modes" below.


data_security_erase
   erases the tape media from its current position to the end of tape
   (EOT) reflective marker.  Additional "erase" control orders can be
   issued to erase any data written beyond the EOT reflective marker.
   No more than 40 additional erase control orders should be issued
   since the tape volume could run off the supply reel.
d200
   sets density to 200 bpi.
d556
   sets density to 556 bpi.
d800
   sets density to 800 bpi.  This is the default.
d1600
   sets density to 1600 bpi.


d6250
   sets density to 6250 bpi.
erase
   erases tape for a distance of three inches from the current
   position.
fixed_record_length
   specifies that no record length information is expected by the
   caller since all data records are of a fixed length specified by a
   fixed bin(21) value.  The record length is specified in bytes.
forward_file
   positions the tape past the next file mark encountered on the tape.
forward_record
   positions the tape after the next record (or file mark if one
   follows the current record) encountered on the tape.


io_call
   supports the io_call command protocol for orders that expect nonnull
   info pointers.  This order is prepared to interpret and print the
   status returned by the saved_status and request_status orders.
nine
   sets hardware mode to eight/nine bit conversion.  See "Hardware
   modes" below.
protect
   sets write inhibit regardless of the presence of a write permit ring
   in the tape reel.  The tape unit will remain write inhibited until
   the tape is detached.
request_status
   interrogates the tape controller and returns its status as a bit(12)
   aligned quantity.


reset_status
   causes all resettable statuses of the tape unit to be reset.
retry_count
   specifies a fixed bin(17) value which is the number of times an
   operation is to be retried before returning an error to the caller.
   The default value for the retry count is 10.
rewind
   rewinds the tape to load point.
saved_status
   returns the last status returned from the tape controller as a
   bit(12) aligned quantity.
unload
   rewinds the tape and unloads it (done automatically when the tape is
   detached).
write_eof
   writes an end of file mark (EOF).


Hardware modes:  In BCD mode, allowed only for 7-track drives, 6-bit
characters are translated and then put on tape one character per frame.
The translation is reversed on input.

In nine mode, on output four 8-bit bytes are written from each word
ignoring the high order bit of each 9-bit byte (by truncating it).  On
input, 8-bit characters are converted to 9-bit characters by forcing
the high order bit to zero (by appending a zero-bit).  This mode should
be used to put ASCII or EBCDIC data on tape for transfer to other
systems with 8-bit bytes.


In binary mode, all 36 bits of each word are read or written.  This
mode should be used for native Multics applications where binary data
is written to tape.

    9-track write  9 8-bit bytes (2 words) are written to 9 frames
                   on tape.
    9-track read   9 frames are read into 9 8-bit bytes (2 words).

    7-track write  6 6-bit frames from each word.
    7-track read   6 frames on tape are read into 6 6-bit characters
                   (1 word).

    7-track is 6 data + 1 parity track.
    9-track is 8 data + 1 parity track.


Close operation:  The close operation rewinds the tape reel.  The tape
remains mounted, and positioned at the load point.  No further I/O
operations may be performed unless the I/O switch is opened again.


Detach operation:  The detach operation unloads the tape.


Read_record operation:  The logical record returned by the read_record
operation contains m=ceil(n/36) words, where n is the number of data
bits in the physical record.  The first n bits of the input record are
the data bits, the last m-n bits are 0's.  The buffer supplied to the
read_record operation must be word aligned.  Read requests are retried
10 times before reporting an error unless a retry_count control order
has been used to change the retry count.


Write_record operation:  The logical record supplied to the
write_record operation must be word aligned, and must contain 0 mod 36
data bits.


Notes:  This I/O module violates those iox_ conventions that seem ill
suited to processing raw tapes.  In particular, read_record and skip
record operations may pass file marks.  For example, if a tape contains
two records, A and B, separated by a file mark, then the first read
request would read record A, a second read request would return
error_table_$end_of_info, and a third read request would return
record B.


Buffer size:  The maximum number of bytes that may be transmitted on a
read_record or write_record operation is 180224, less overhead.  This
limit may be administratively restricted to a lower value.  To use the
full capability, the caller may need access to
>system_library_1>rcp_sys_ or >sc1>rcp>workspace.acs.
