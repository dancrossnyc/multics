10/12/88  check_iacl

Syntax as a command:  check_iacl {path} {-control_args}


Function: lists segments whose access control lists (ACLs) disagree
with the initial ACL for segments.  (For a description of ACLs and
initial ACLs, see the Programmer's Reference Manual.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory whose segment ACLs are to be
   checked against the segment initial ACL.  If you omit path, the
   working directory is assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   lists User_ids in a segment ACL excluded from the initial ACL and
   User_ids included in the initial ACL but omitted from a segment ACL.
   If you give no -all, only User_ids in addition to those in the
   initial ACL are listed.
-exclude User_id, -ex User_id
   excludes the specified User_id from the comparison of IACL with
   entry ACL.  Up to 10 -exclude control arguments may be given.
   The ACL matching convention is allowed, as described in Notes below.


NOTES
The strategy for matching an access control name argument is defined by
three rules:

   1) A literal component, including "*", matches only a component of
      the same name.  For example:
         "*.*.*" matches only the literal ACL entry "*.*.*"

   2) A missing component delimited by a period matches any component.
      For examples:
         ".." matches any ACL entry.
         "." matches any ACL entry whose third component value is "*"

   3) A missing component not delimited by a period is treated the same
      as a literal "*".  For example:
         "*.Multics" is treated as "*.Multics.*"

      Missing components on the left must be delimited by periods.  For
      example:
         "..a" matches any ACL entry whose third component value is "a"
