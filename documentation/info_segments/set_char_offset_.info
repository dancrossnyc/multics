:Entry: set_char_offset_:  06/18/81  set_char_offset_

Function:  returns a pointer to the specified character in
the segment referenced by the input pointer.


Syntax:
dcl set_char_offset_ entry (ptr, fixed bin (21)) returns (ptr)
     reducible;
new_pointer_value = set_char_offset_ (pointer_value, char_offset);


Arguments:
pointer_value
   identifies the segment in which the desired character resides.
   (Input)
char_offset
   is the offset (relative to the base of the segment) of the desired
   character.  (Input)
new_pointer_value
   is the result of this operation.  (Output)


Notes:  The first character in a segment has a character offset of
zero.

If the value of char_offset is negative or greater than 1,048,575 (the
offset of the last character in a 256K word segment), the resulting
value of the call is not defined.
