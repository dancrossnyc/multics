10/20/86  create_list, cls

Syntax as a command:  cls path {-control_arg}


Function:  creates a nonprintable lister file (upon which document
processing is performed) from a listin file (the ASCII file used to
input and update a list).  See also the description of the make_list
command, which creates an empty lister file from information supplied
on the command line.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the listin file.  The suffix listin must be the
   last component of the listin segment name; however, if path does not
   have a suffix of listin, one is assumed.  A lister file is created
   in the working directory with the same entryname as path, and with
   the entryname suffix of listin changed to lister.  Any existing copy
   of this lister file is overwritten.


Control arguments:
-output_file PATH, -of PATH
   causes the lister file to be placed in PATH.  Lister must be the
   last component of the segment identified by PATH; however, if PATH
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.  If this control
   argument is not specified, the lister file is placed in the working
   directory, and has the same entryname as the listin file, except
   that the listin suffix is changed to lister.
-totals, -tt
   prints number of records in path.


Notes:  The creation of a lister file is the only List Processing
operation which uses listin files as input.  All other operations use
lister files as input (which are unprintable files containing ASCII and
binary information).


A listin file provides an ASCII representation of a list.  It is used
to input and update a list.  The listin files can be created and
updated by using any text editor.


The create_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the lister file is not created or the
invocation of create_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 0 is
set when the lister file is successfully created.
