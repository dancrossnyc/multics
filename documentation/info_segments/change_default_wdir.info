02/24/84  change_default_wdir, cdwd

Syntax:  cdwd {path}


Function: sets a directory as your default working directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory; if omitted, the current working
   directory becomes the default working directory.

issued with no argument, the default working directory becomes the
current working directory.

The original default working directory is your home directory upon
logging in.
