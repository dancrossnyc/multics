Syntax:  decat strA strB C


Syntax as active function:  [decat strA strB C]


Function:  performs operations on bit or character strings.  These
operations are specified by a three-digit bit string given last in the
usage line.


Arguments:
strA, strB
   are character strings or bit strings entered as 0 and 1 characters.
C
   is any three-digit bit string expressed as 0 and 1 characters such
   as 000,001,...,111.


Notes:  The first occurrence of strB found in strA divides strA into
three parts:  part prior to strB, part matching strB, and part
following strB.  The digits given in C correspond to these three parts.
The return string contains the parts of strA whose corresponding bit in
C is 1.  All three parts are returned in their original order of
appearance in strA.
