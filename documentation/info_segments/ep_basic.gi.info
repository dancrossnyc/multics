05/10/76  Extended Precision BASIC

   BASIC is available in extended as well as single precision. Single precision
is the default. To get extended precision, invoke the use_ep_basic command with
no arguments before invoking basic or basic_system. Extended precision stays
on until the use_sp_basic command is issued.

   Single and extended precision programs should not be run at the same time
because the numeric arguments and numeric files are not compatible
The convert_numeric_file command is available for converting numeric files
from single to extended and vice versa.

   A new statement type has been added to provide a means of dynamically
controlling the number of digits in a numeric value to be printed as output.
Its syntax is:
	setdigits formula
The value expressed by formula is truncated to its integer value, and
represents the number of digits to be printed by all future PRINT statements
until another SETDIGITS statement is executed, or until the end of program
execution. The value can be 1 through 19. This statement applies only to
nonintegers. The tab spacing is adjusted to accomodate the current number
length. However, the spacing will never be less than the default.
