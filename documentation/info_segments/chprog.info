02/06/84  chprog

Syntax:  chprog Person_id {prog_no}


Function: allows the accounting administrator to change the programmer
number for a user.  The programmer number must be all numeric and
can be up to sixteen characters long.  (Some installations use the
employee number assigned by the company in this field.) If the new
programmer number is not supplied, the old value is displayed and a
change is accepted.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose programmer number is to be
   changed.
prog_no
   is the new programmer number.  If this argument is omitted, the
   chprog command prints the old programmer number and then waits for
   the accounting administrator to either enter the new programmer
   number or a null line (to retain the old number).
