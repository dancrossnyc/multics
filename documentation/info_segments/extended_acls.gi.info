Extended access control terms are part of standard Multics Access
Control Lists (ACLs).  They are used by subsystems to control access
to protected entries.  For instance, a Multics mailbox has extended
modes such as append, delete, and read associated with them.

You can list, modify, and delete extended ACLs with the list_acl,
set_acl, and delete_acl commands.  These commands operate on storage
system entries that use extended entries by using the fs_util_
subroutine, which is part of the Multics extended entry software.
(See extended_entries.gi.)


To protect against accidental application of improper extended ACL
modes to extended entries, set_acl doesn't operate on extended entries
if you specify the starname "**" or a starname whose last component
contains a "*" or "?".  This protects against having the command "sa
** r *.*" give all users only r extended access to a mailbox.
