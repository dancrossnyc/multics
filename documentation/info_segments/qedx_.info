:Info: qedx_:  1983-02-07  qedx_

Function:  provides a subroutine interface to the Multics qedx Editor
for use by subsystems wishing to edit arbitrary strings of ASCII text.


Syntax:
dcl  qedx_ entry (ptr, fixed bin (35));
call qedx_ (qedx_info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
qedx_info_ptr
   is a pointer to the qedx_info structure which defines the buffers
   initially available in qedx_ along with other options.  See "The
   qedx_info structure" below.  (Input)
code
   is a standard system status code.  See "List of status code" below.
   (Output)


Notes:
The caller of qedx_ does not need to print an error message when a
non-zero status code is returned by the subroutine.  Any appropriate
error messages will have already been printed by qedx_ itself.  The
returned code is only intended to inform the caller of conditions
requiring further attention.


List of status codes:
0
   editing completed successfully.
error_table_$unimplemented_version
   qedx_ does not recognize the version of the qedx_info structure
   supplied by the caller.
error_table_$fatal_error
   an error occured during initialization of qedx_ which prevented the
   user from performing any editing.  The caller of qedx_ should abort
   its execution.


error_table_$recoverable_error
   one of several non-fatal conditions were detected upon exit from
   qedx_.  The exact condition is reflected to the caller in the
   qedx_info structure (see below).  The caller of qedx_ must decide
   how to proceed after each of the possible conditions.  (Eg: the
   program may decide not to update the permanent copy of the data
   being edited if the user exited via quit-force (qf).)


Notes on initial buffers:
The qedx_info structure defines the initial environment to be presented
to the user by qedx_.  This environment includes an initial set of
buffers along with their contents and default pathnames.  The contents
of these buffers can be read or written from the storage system, from
regions supplied by the caller (eg: the message in send_mail), or by
using a caller supplied procedure (eg: to read/write abbreviation
definitions).  The caller may also request that the initial contents of
one or more of these buffers be executed as qedx requests before
reading the first request line from the user.


qedx_ always creates a buffer named "0" which it makes the current
buffer before executing any requests.  If the initial buffers marked
for execution do not use the buffer (b) request to change the default
buffer, buffer "0" will remain the current buffer when the first
request line is read from the terminal.


Each initial buffer must have a default pathname.  As part of
initialization, qedx_ will read the contents of the object specified by
this default pathname into the buffer.  If the buffer is read and
written from the storage system, the default pathname must identify an
existing segment or archive component.  If the buffer is read and
written from a caller supplied region, the default pathname may be
omitted but is normally used as comment to described the contents of
the buffer (eg: "<send_mail message>") as the data is read directly
from the caller's region.  If the buffer is read and written by a
caller supplied procedure, the default pathname must identify an
existing object (eg: abbreviation definition) as defined by that
procedure.


For each initial buffer, the caller may specify whether or not the
default pathname of the buffer is locked.  If the default pathname is
locked, use of the read (r) and write (w) requests with a pathname will
never change the default pathname of the buffer nor cause qedx_ to
consider the default pathname untrustworthy.  (See "Notes on default
pathnames" in the description of the qedx command).

With a locked default pathname, use of the read and write requests
without a pathname will always read/write the original segment, region,
or whatever (when using the caller's I/O module) specified by the
caller of qedx_.  In this case, use of the read request with a pathname
will simplly insert the contents of a segment into the buffer and use
of the write request with a pathname will simply make a copy of the
buffer in a segment for later use.


Locking the default pathname is useful in cases where it would be
difficult (if not impossible) for the user to reconstruct the default
pathname.  For example, in send_mail, buffer "0" contains the message
being created.  The default pathname in this case identifies the region
supplied by send_mail and there is no mechanism by which the user can
explicitly specify this default by a pathname.  Therefore, send_mail
locks the default pathname to insure that the write (w) request without
a pathname will always update send_mail's copy of the message.


For each initial buffer which is being read and written from a caller
supplied region, the caller may request that qedx_ automatically write
the contents of the buffer into the region upon exit.  If the user
exits qedx_ via the quit-force (qf) request, however, the automatic
write will be suppressed.  If, when writing a buffer to the caller's
region, the buffer is too long to fit in that region, qedx_ will issue
a warning to the user and the buffer will be marked as truncated.
While still in qedx_, the user can make any necessary changes to the
buffer to shorten it sufficiently to fit within the caller's region.
If, on exit from qedx_, there are truncated buffers, the user will be
asked for permission to exit and actually truncate those buffers.  Once
again, this query is suppressed if the quit-force request is used.

List of qedx_info structure elements:
version
   identifies the version of the qedx_info structure supplied by the
   caller.  It must have the value of the named constant
   QEDX_INFO_VERSION_1.  (Input)
editor_name
   is the name to be used by qedx_ in error messages and queries.
   (Eg: "send_mail (qedx)") (Input)
buffer_io
   is only used if flags.caller_does_io is set and is the procedure to
   be invoked by qedx_ to read/write buffers.  For details about this
   subroutine, type:  help qedx_buffer_io
   (Input)


flags.no_rw_path
   specifies whether any read (r) or write (w) request within qedx_ may
   ever be given an explicit pathname.  (Input)
flags.query_if_modified
   specifies whether qedx_ should query when the quit (q) request is
   issued and there are buffers which have been modified since they
   were last written.  Initial buffers with the buffers.auto_write flag
   set are not considered as modified as they are always written before
   exit.  (Input)
flags.caller_does_io
   specifies whether qedx_ should call the buffer_io procedure above or
   perform I/O itself when reading/writing buffers.  (Input)


flags.quit_forced
   is set by qedx_ to "1"b to indicate that the user either used the
   quit-force (qf) request or answered "yes" to the modified buffers
   query in order to exit; it is set to "0"b to indicate that the user
   used the quit (q) request and there were no modified buffers
   present.  (Output)
flags.buffers_truncated
   is set by qedx_ to "1"b to indicate that the final contents of one
   or more initial buffers were truncated on exit from qedx_.  The
   buffers which were truncated are marked by the buffers.truncated
   flag.  (Output)


n_buffers
   is the number of initial buffers defined below.  (Input)
buffers
   defines the initial buffers available within this invocation of
   qedx_.  See "Notes on initial buffers" above.
buffers.buffer_name
   is the name of this buffer.  (Input)
buffers.buffer_pathname
   is the initial default pathname for this buffer.  (Input)
buffers.region_ptr
   is a pointer to the region where qedx_ will read and write this
   buffer if buffers.read_write_region is set.  (Input)


buffers.region_max_lth
   is the maximum number of characters which may be written into the
   above region if buffers.read_write_region is set.  (Input)
buffers.region_initial_lth
   is the number of characters present in the caller's region on entry
   to qedx_ if buffers.read_write_region is set.  qedx_ will
   automatically read the specified characters into the buffer.
   (Input)
buffers.region_final_lth
   is set by qedx_ to the number of characters written into the
   caller's region upon exit from qedx_ if bufers.read_write_region is
   set.  This value will be larger than buffers.region_max_lth if
   buffers.truncated is set by qedx_.  (Output)


buffers.read_write_region
   specifies that qedx_ will use the caller's region to read/write the
   contents of this buffer until the user changes the default pathname.
   Use of this flag is incompatible with flags.caller_does_io.  (Input)
buffers.locked_pathname
   specifies that the default pathname of this buffer is locked and can
   not be changed by read (r) or write (w) requests.  (Input)
buffers.execute_buffer
   specifies that the contents of this buffer should be executed as
   qedx requests before reading requests from the user.  (Input)


buffers.default_read_ok
   specifies that the read (r) request can be given without a pathname
   to read the current contents of the caller's region.  This flag is
   ignored if flags.read_write_region is not set or the default
   pathname is not the caller's region.  (Input)
buffers.default_write_ok
   specifies that the write (w) request can be given without a pathname
   to write the buffer to the caller's region.  This flag is ignored if
   flags.read_write_region is not set or the default pathname is not
   the caller's region.  (Input)


buffers.auto_write
   specifies that the contents of this buffer will be written to the
   caller's region on exit from qedx_ unless the user uses the
   quit-force (qf) request or answers "yes" to the query to exit with
   modified buffers.  (Input)
buffers.truncated
   is set by qedx_ to "1"b if the entire contents of the buffer could
   not be written to the caller's region on exit from qedx_.  (Output)


:Info: qedx_buffer_io:  2020-05-18  qedx_buffer_io

Function:
When using the qedx_ subroutine, if qedx_info.flags.caller_does_io is
set, qedx_ will invoke the caller supplied qedx_buffer_io procedure
in order to read and write the contents of any buffer.  qedx_
determines the pathname to which the buffer is to be read or written;
the interpretation of this pathname is the responsibility of the
caller's buffer_io procedure.  (Eg: the procedure may use the
pathname as the name of an abbreviation whose definition is to be
read/written).


For a read (r) request, qedx_ supplies an I/O region into which the
buffer_io procedure should place the text copied from the object
designated by the pathname; qedx_ will then insert this text into its
proper place in the buffer.  For a write (w) request, qedx_ copies the
text from the buffer into an I/O region; the buffer_io procedure should
then place this text into the object designated by the pathname.


Syntax:
dcl  qedx_buffer_io entry (ptr, bit(1) aligned);
call qedx_buffer_io (qedx_buffer_io_info_ptr, success);


Arguments:
qedx_buffer_io_info_ptr
   is a pointer to the qedx_buffer_io_info structure describing the
   read/write operation to be undertaken.  (Input)
success
   is set by the buffer_io procedure to "1"b if the operation was
   successfull and to "0"b if it failed.  (Output)


Notes:
It is the responsibilty of the qedx_buffer_io procedure to print any
appropriate error messages if the operation does not succeed.


Notes on the qedx_buffer_io_info structure:
The qedx_buffer_io_info structure and the named constants referenced
below are defined in the qedx_buffer_io_info.incl.pl1 include file.

   dcl  1 qedx_buffer_io_info aligned based (qbii_ptr),
	2 version character (8),
	2 editor_name character (72),
	2 pathname character (256) unaligned,
	2 buffer_ptr pointer,
	2 buffer_max_lth fixed binary (21),
	2 buffer_lth fixed binary (21),
	2 direction fixed binary,
	2 flags,
	  3 default_pathname bit (1) unaligned,
	  3 pad bit (35) unaligned;


List of qedx_buffer_io_info elements:
version
   identifies the version of the qedx_buffer_io_info structure supplied
   by qedx_.  This version of the structure is given by the named
   constant QEDX_BUFFER_IO_INFO_VERSION_1.  (Output)
editor_name
   is the name of the editor to be used by the buffer_io procedure in
   any error messages and queries.  (Input)
pathname
   is the pathname to be read/written as determined by qedx_.  (Input)


buffer_ptr
   is a pointer to the I/O buffer allocated by qedx_.  When reading
   from the pathname, the buffer_io procedure must place the text into
   this buffer; when writing to the pathname, the buffer_io procedure
   must take the text from this buffer.  (Input)
buffer_max_lth
   is the maximum size of the I/O buffer.  This value is only used when
   reading from the pathname and specifies a limit on the amount of
   text which may be returned by the buffer_io procedure.  (Input)


buffer_lth
   is the length of the text read/written from the pathname.  When
   reading from the pathname, the buffer_io procedure must set this
   value to the number of characters read from the pathname and placed
   in the I/O buffer.  (Output)  When writing to the pathname, this
   value is set by qedx_ to the number of characters to be written into
   the pathname.  (Input)
direction
   specifies the operation to be undertaken.  If it has the value of
   the named constant QEDX_READ_FILE, the text is to be read from the
   pathname and placed into the I/O buffer.  It is has the value of the
   named constant QEDX_WRITE_FILE, the text is to be written from the
   I/O buffer into the pathname.  (Input)


flags.default_pathname
   is "1"b if the pathname supplied above by qedx_ is the default
   pathname of the buffer being read/written.  (Input)
