02/21/84  disklow

Syntax:  disklow {left {pct}


Function: allows the system administrator to scan the projfile segment
and report on each project whose remaining disk storage (difference
between quota and used) is low.  The disk storage can be checked
either by number of free records or percent of disk occupied or both.


Arguments:
left
   prints a line for all projects with less than left free records,
   where left is in integer.
pct
   prints a line for all projects occupying more than pct percent of
   their disk storage quota.


Notes:  Left must be given in order to give pct.  The default values
for left and pct are 20 and 90, respectively.  If the system
administrator wants to receive only percentage information, he must
given left as 0.

The projfile segment is assumed to be in the working directory and is
an implicit input to disklow.
