Known errors in the current release of apl.
#	Associated TR's
Description

491  phx14469
when a suspended function with labels is edited, not matter how
trivially, SI DAMAGE results.  SI DAMAGE is defined to result only in a
limited number of cases when editing a function.

490  phx14469
stop and trace vectors are lost across function edits.

489  phx14469
If you edit a suspended function you get an SI DAMAGE error even if you
actually make no changes to the function.

488  phx13315
APL should be changed to call cu_$evaluate_active_string to perform
active function evaluation (qAF).  It currently calls cu_$af, which is
not the right thing, and will break soon.

486  MPR6751
The qNL system function returns a garbage value if the left arg is an
expression.  Try:
     A-17
     (1p'A') qNL 2

484  phx09164
APL interprets the mode string to get the terminal's line length.  It
should call get_line_length_.  APL will break when the mode string
format changes.

483  
The last character of qCS (qCS[195]) is still c<BS>|
(cent sign) instead of -<BS>,

482  phx7511
The algorithm used by the domino operator will sometimes
diagnose a regular matrix as singular and report a
DOMAIN ERROR.  For more info and a fix see phx07511.

478  phx7211
read_tsoapl_tape references error_table_$too_many_files.
See phx07211.

477  phx7211
apl_dim_util_ references apl_error_table_$no_room_for_sdb
See phx07211.

475  
The APL dim should restore normal terminal modes whenever
the user is returned to command level (whether or not
it was intensional).

474  
In the editor [<n>q2] (editing starting at the 2nd column)
positions the cursor correctly at first, but
inserts space or deletes chars from column 1.  Starting
in column 1 or 3 works OK.

471  
If the same variable is listed as both a parameter and a
local variable of a function, improper localization may
occur, causing a downward funarg problem.

467  
5 5 ^| 1  gives a LENGTH ERROR instead of a 5x5 matrix
with a 1 in the upper left corner and 0's elsewhere.

466  
While doing quote-quad input the input prompt may be
spuriously be printed.  Problem with the dim.

465  
Single-quotes typed in comments at function definition
time are not ignored.  This is a problem with the dim.

463  phx14466
The editor does not allow del to be typed into comments or strings
while editing.  Del is looked for too globally by the editor.

462  
Certain index errors in axis operators are reported as rank
errors. Try: 0,[0] 2 2 p 1 2 3 4

461  
APL does not preserve trailing blanks on quota-quad input.
IBM standard is to preserve them.

458  
)SI should print negative line numbers for damaged fcns;
returning to a damaged fcn should print SI DAMAGE, and
then return immediately. Maybe a damaged flag in the
lexed function bead or function frame would be handy
(watch out for save and load).

457  
should be able to edit pendent functions; its the only
way to list them, after all. Just be sure to handle any
SI DAMAGE.

456  
editor does not wrap lines longer than qPW properly.
(meta-issue: no programs should rely on the DIM to wrap).

455  
bare output (quote-quad) should ignore qPW.

453  
q-<A-<10E38 prints the positive identity! Should give a
NONCE ERROR because 10E38 is too big.

451  MPR5355
)DFN A$B works; should be refused. Also if the sum of the
segname and entryname is longer than 32 chars, it fails.

449  
matrix divide/invert (domino) sometimes fails if operands
are expressions. Bypass is to make them names.

448  
(i0)^|SCALAR and (i0)v|SCALAR get out_of_bounds faults!

447  
VECTOR[''] should work; type of null vector should be
ignored in this context.

446  
(i0)_f(i0) should work; gets a LENGTH ERROR.

437  
)LIB (and maybe others) accept signed library numbers!
Should accept only unsigned integers.

436  
)SI and )SINL ignore any arguments; should diagnose them.

434  
apl does not co-exist with either audit or graphics. If
you wish to audit an apl session, you must attach_audit
AFTER entering apl, and detach_audit BEFORE leaving apl.
If you wish to use graphics with apl, you must
setup_graphics BEFORE entering apl, and remove_graphics
AFTER leaving apl. The fix to this problem involves
changing both apl and graphics.

428  
qPW fails to change line length on user_output. )WIDTH
is OK.

427  
running a function with errors produces no messages (post
4.00 only).

418  
cannot invert 4 4p2 0 0 0 6 1 0 ^1 8 2 ^2 0 4 2 ^2 2. Yet
it would appear to be invertible, since BASIC can do it.
Answer is 4 4p.5 0 0 0 ^2 1 ^.5 .5 0 1 ^1 .5 1 0 ^.5 .5
Problem is completely incorrect pivoting algorithm.

409  
apl accepts pathnames for external functions, but won't
initiate them properly if the reference name is already
known.

399  
)COPY WS qLX fails...cannot copy any system variables.
Should diagnose it. IBM doesn't permit it, either.

394  
can't )ERASE a stop/trace vector. Bypass-- assign '' to
it. Should diagnose stop/trace and system variables.

389  
1 8^|0 8p0 produces garbage instead of zeros. bug in 
take can be bypassed by using a name as right arg, not
an expr.

377  
apl_error_ should print non-apl status codes in long form
automatically.

376  
there is a window in assignment (specification) such that
quitting in the window can lose the value of a variable.

374  
the list (2 2p5;6 7 8) fails. Handling of cons is wrong.

358  
integer tolerance algorithm fails if qIT is exactly
zero.  This causes various Boolean operators to give
DOMAIN ERRORs for integer arguments. The following
programs are affected: apl_arrow_operators_,
apl_domino_operator_, apl_file_system, apl_monadic_,
apl_monadic_format_, apl_monadic_rho_, apl_parse_,
apl_random_, apl_rotate_, apl_subscript_a_value_,
apl_system_functions_, apl_system_variables_,
apl_transpose_.

357  
matrix inverter inverts 10xA but not A.  See test case.

355  
editor should diagnose redundant localizations.

337  
change character and editor input modes to reattach
user_input to user_i/o after end-of-file. (editor fixed
in 4.00)

321  
(f/'')>-(f/'') gets a DOMAIN ERROR.  Problem with
comparison tolerance checking algorithm.

306  
neither ctw nor apl checks saved functions for syntax
errors.

305  
ctw does not convert S-delta and T-delta correctly.

303  
apl and apl_start should reject -ttp when in absentee.

301  
all subroutines that decrement reference counts should
null their input argument.

299  
DIM doesn't pad LF character (\300).

285  
)LOAD TEST285;S-<1;)SAVE;)LOAD; value of S has reverted
to localized value, not 1.  Seems to be caused by bad
SI.

284  
)CONTINUE command does not respect restrict_save
flag...anyway, it should probably have its own restrict
flag.

277  
ravel operator does not recover space used by rho vector
if arg was on stack; this causes problems for file
system.

275  
lex-- (V+V)[1 2 3]-<4 5 6 gives wrong error
message...complains about system variables!

263  
convert DIM to iox_, convert ios_ calls to iox, have apl
use use user_input and user_output instead of apl_input
and apl_output.

258  
editor doesn't take line length into account during
output.

249  
command: "apl -td non_existant_dir" causes apl to blow up.

240  
editor: one-line listing non-existant fcn should leave
defn mode.  (gFOO [q]g). 4.00 editor leaves defn mode,
but also creates a function named FOO!

237  
lex: confusing message printed for +-\[3]A (-\ conflicts
with [3]).

187  
103<BS><ATTN><BS><ATTN>5 should be 15, not 105.

168  
dim: N_ in first column (after hidden NL) prints as N,
dropping underscore.
