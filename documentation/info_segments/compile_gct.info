Syntax:  compile_gct segname {-control_args}


Function:  compiles a segment containing the source of a Graphics
Character Table (GCT).


Arguments:
segname
   is the name of a segment containing the source of a GCT.  The
   suffix .gct is assumed if not specified.


Control arguments:
-check, -ck
   specifies that the ALM assembler is not to be invoked, and that
   the intermediate assembler source file is to be retained.
-list, -ls
   specifies that the ALM assembler is to produce a listing of the
   GCT it creates.


Notes:  The compile_gct command compiles a GCT source segment into 
an assembly language source segment.  The Multics ALM assembler is
then invoked internally to assemble this intermediate segment into a
GCT.  The final segment produced has the name of the source segment
without the suffix ".gct".

For a description of Graphic Character Tables, see the Multics
Graphics System,. Order No. AS40.
