02/28/84  comp_dir_info

Syntax:  comp_dir_info path1 path2 {-control_args}


Function: compares two directory information segments created by
save_dir_info and reports on the differences.


Arguments:
path1
   is the pathname of the old directory information segment.  The
   dir_info suffix need not be given.
path2
   is the pathname of the new directory information segment.  The
   dir_info suffix need not be given.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   compares and prints minimum information (see "Notes.")
-verbose, -vb
   compares and prints almost all information.  (Default)
-long, -lg
   compares and prints all information.


Notes: Output is written on user_output.  Unless -brief is specified,
output is preceded by a formfeed character and a header identifying
the directories to be compared and the times that information was
saved by save_dir_info.  If no changes are found according to the
specified control arguments, the string "Identical." is printed.

Output is in three sections--
   modified entries
   deleted entries
   added entries
and is identified by entry type (dir, seg, or link) and entryname.


For deletions and additions a heading is printed of the form
   deleted: type entryname
followed by a listing of the attributes of the deleted or added entry
   item_name: value

For segments that have been modified a heading is printed of the form
   modified: type entryname
followed by either of the following:
   item_name changed from value1 to value2
   item_name added: value


The -brief, -verbose and -long control arguments print increasing
amounts of information.  In the list below, each control argument is
assumed to print all the information listed for it.

Segments--
-bf: names, type, date used, date modified
-vb: date branch modified, volume, records used, bit count, bit count
     author, max length, safety switch
-lg: ACL, date dumped, current length, copy switch, tpd switch, ring
     brackets, unique id, author


Directories--
-bf: names, type, date used, date modified, sons volume, master dir
-vb: date branch modified, bit count, records used, quota, date dumped,
     current length, ring brackets, unique id, author, bit count
     author, max length, safety switch
-lg: ACL, initial seg ACL, initial dir ACL

Links--
