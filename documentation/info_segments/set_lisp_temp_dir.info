:Info: set_lisp_temp_dir:  1988-04-15  set_lisp_temp_dir

Syntax as a command:  set_lisp_temp_dir {path_spec}


Function: specifies the directory to use for temporary segments
created in a lisp environment. A directory other than the process
dir may be specified.


Arguments:
path_spec
   specifies the directory in which to place the
   temporary segs. This argument is optional and if not given the
   process directory will be used. If given, the path_spec takes
   one of the following forms:

   path
      specifies the absolute or relative pathname of an existing
      directory.
   -working_dir, -wd
      specifies the current working dir for the temp seg storage.
   -process_dir, -pd
      specifies the process dir (default).


Notes:
Any lisp environment, such as emacs, will be affected by this
command.  Any new lisp temp segs will be placed in the specified
directory.  Existing temp segs will not be moved to the new
directory.  Temp segs placed in a directory other than the process
dir will be preserved across processes and system interruptions.
While this is useful for debugging and for holding large temp segs,
care should be taken to delete obsolete segs as each process will
create new copies.
