07/15/82  Common access class ceiling

Facilities like the Inter-Multics File Transfer (IMFT) facility
translate Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM) attributes between two
systems.  For these facilities, the concept of a common access class
ceiling is used to control the data which may be transferred between
the systems.

The common access class ceiling between two systems is defined as all
sensitivity levels from level 0 (usually un-named) up to but not
including the first level which does not have the same long and short
name on both systems and all access categories that have the same long
and short names on both systems.

If the long and short names of sensitivity level 0 are not the same on
both systems, then the two systems have no common acccess ceiling and
are isolated from each other.


For example, if system A defines the following AIM attributes --

	level 0	     *-* UN-NAMED *-*
	level 1	     unclassified	     u
	level 2	     secret	     s
	level 3	     top secret	     ts

	category 1     SSTD		     sstd
	category 2     LISD		     lisd
	category 3     FSD		     (none)
	category 4     Marketing	     (none)


and system B defines the following attributes --

	level 0	     *-* UN-NAMED *-*
	level 1	     unclassified	     u
	level 2	     restricted	     (none)

	category 1     MPO		     (none)
	category 2     LISD		     lisd
	category 3     FSD		     fsd
	category 4     SSTD		     sstd


then the common access ceiling is --

	unclassified, LISD, SSTD
