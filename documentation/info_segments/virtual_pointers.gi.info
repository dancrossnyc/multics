09/10/87  Virtual Pointers

The cv_ptr_ function converts virtual pointers that contain one or two
components -- a segment identifier and an optional offset into the
segment.  Altogether, seventeen forms are accepted.  They are shown in
the list below.

In the list that follows, W is an octal word offset from the beginning
of the segment.  It may have a value from 0 to 777777 inclusive.  B is
a decimal bit offset within the word.  It may have a value from 0 to 35
inclusive.


List of virtual pointers:
path|W(B)
   points to octal word W, decimal bit B of segment or MSF identified
   by absolute or relative pathname path.  If the path given identifies
   a multisegment file, the offset given is in component 0 of the MSF.
path|W
   same as path|W(0).
path|
   same as path|0(0).
path
   same as path|0(0).
path|entry_pt
   points to word identified by entry point entry_pt in the object file
   (segment or MSF) identified by path.


dir>entry$entry_pt
   points to word identified by entry point entry_pt in the object file
   identified by pathname dir>entry.
<dir>entry$entry_pt
   points to word identified by entry point entry_pt in the object file
   identified by pathname <dir>entry.
<entry$entry_pt
   points to word identified by entry point entry_pt in the object file
   identified by pathname <entry.


ref_name$entry_pt
   points to word identified by entry point entry_pt in the file whose
   reference name is ref_name.
ref_name$W(B)
   points to octal word W, decimal bit B of segment or MSF whose
   reference name is ref_name.  If ref_name is a reference name on a
   multisegment file (ie. on component 0 of the MSF), the word and bit
   offsets are applied within component 0.
ref_name$W
   same as ref_name$W(0).
ref_name$
   same as ref_name$0(0).


segno|W(B)
   points to octal word W, decimal bit B of segment whose octal
   segment number is segno.
segno|W
   same as segno|W(0).
segno|
   same as segno|0(0).
segno
   same as segno|0(0).
segno|entry_pt
   points to word identified by entry point entry_pt in segment whose
   octal segment number is segno.  If segno identifies component 0 of
   an object MSF, the pointer returned may not point within the segment
   identified, since the target of a definition in component 0 of an
   object MSF will be in another component of the object MSF.


Notes:  A null pointer is represented by the virtual pointer 77777|1,
by -1|1, or by -1.
