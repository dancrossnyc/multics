01/30/87 process_compout, pco

Syntax as a command:  pco paths {-control_args}


Function:  processes one or more compose output (compout) files to an
online device, or to a magnetic or punched paper tape.  All or portions
of the files may be requested.


Arguments:

paths
   are the pathnames of input files to be processed.  The suffix
   compout must be the last component of the input file entrynames
   (but, see -pathname control argument below); however, the suffix
   need not be supplied in the command line.  Output is produced in the
   order in which the pathnames are given in the command line.


Control arguments:
   All control arguments specified in the command line apply to all
   input file pathnames given.
-files {n}{,m}
   overrides either or both of the default output file factors when
   writing output to magnetic or paper tape.  (The default output file
   factors are found in the header record of the input file and are set
   from data in the device description table.)  n is the maximum number
   of pages per file and m is the maximum number of files allowed on
   the tape.
-from n, -fm n
   starts printed output at page n.  This control argument is mutually
   exclusive with the -pages control argument.  (The default value of n
   is "1".)  See "Page Numbers" below for a discussion of page numbers.


-mode xxx
   selects any of the known alternative modes of output or specifies an
   entirely new mode.  Built in modes are:  comment, setup, display,
   display -long, and dump.
-pages n | n,n ..., -pgs n | n,n ...
-page n | n,n ..., -pg n | n,n ...
   specifies a blank-separated list of selected pages to be printed.
   Each member of the list must be a single page, {n}, or a range of
   pages {n,n}.  The page numbers given must constantly increase
   without duplication.  At least one page must be specified.  This
   control argument is mutually exclusive with the -from and -to
   control arguments.  (The default for this feature is off.)


-pages_changed, -pgc
   specifies that only addendum pages and those pages containing text
   within the range of a change-bar control (from the pages specified
   by the "-pages" or "-from" and "-to" control arguments, if given)
   are to be printed.
-pathname path, -pn path
   is the pathname of an input file even though it may have the
   appearance of a numeric parameter or a control argument, or is a
   compose bulk output file that does not have the suffix compout.
-stop, -sp
   waits for a newline character (ASCII code 012) from the user before
   beginning each page of output.  If only a newline is typed, the next
   page is printed.  If "q" is typed, the command invocation is
   terminated gracefully.  If "r" is typed, the page just printed is
   reprinted.  (The default for this feature is off.)


-table, -tb
   print a table listing information about all selected pages in the
   file.  Only a table is produced.  This control argument is mutually
   exclusive with all others.
-to n
   ends output after page n.  This control argument is mutually
   exclusive with the -pages control argument.  (The default value for
   n is "$".)
-volume xx
   writes the output to the magnetic tape whose volume name is xx.  The
   parameters needed for attaching the tape are provided by the device
   description table and are contained in the header record of the
   compout file.  The attach descriptions in the file header may be
   selected or overridden by using the -mode control argument described
   above.


-wait, -wt
   waits for a newline character (ASCII code 012) before beginning the
   first page of output to the terminal, but not between pages (see the
   -stop control argument above).  (The default for this feature is
   off.)


Notes:
Page references may be made with !n, $, +n, -n, $-n, or page-id.
'!n' is the n'th physical page in the file.  However, n=0 means 'go
     back to the beginning of the file'.  No page is printed for !0.
'$' is the last physical page in the file.
'+n' and '-n' are the nth page relative to the last page referenced.
'$-n' is the n'th relative page from the end of the file.
'page-id' is the page number constructed by compose.  It may be just
     a simple number or a structured number such as 'B-1', '3-14.2',
     or 'i-5'.  The page-id MUST be an an EXACT match for that in the
     document.  There is no less than/greater than checking possible.


A page selection could be

  -pages !1,!5 +19,+2 127.4,127.42 $-1,$

This means to process four ranges; the first five pages, then the three
pages beginning with the 24th, then the 39 pages beginning with page
number 127.4, then the last 2 pages of the file.


The -table option prints a table of information about selected pages in
a file.  This information includes the physical page number and the
actual page-id.  Any 'changed' pages are marked with CHANGED; front
pages are marked with the FRONT; intentionally blank pages are marked
with BLANK; and missing pages are noted with a comment.  For example:

   pco flow_sheet -to !7 -table

   -pathname flow_sheet -pages
   !1        /*        FRONT     1-5 */
   !2        /*                  1-6       CHANGED */
   !3        /*        FRONT     1-6.1     CHANGED */
   !4        /* BLANK            1-6.2     CHANGED */
   !5        /*        FRONT     1-7 */
             /* blank  back not supplied */
   !6        /*        FRONT     2-1 */
   !7        /*                  2-2 */
   ;
