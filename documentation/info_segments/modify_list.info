10/20/86  modify_list, mdls

Syntax as a command:  mdls path -control_args


Function:  modifies a field or fields in selected lister records.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file.  The suffix lister must be the
   last component of the lister segment name; however, if path does not
   have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppresses the warning when no records match the selection
   expression.
-field_name field_name STR, -fn field_name STR
   causes the value of STR to be assigned to the field indicated by
   field_name.  If STR contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes.
   This control argument is required and may be given more than once.
-select STR, -sel STR
   specifies those records to be modified.  If this control argument is
   not specified, then all the records are modified.


-string STR, -str STR
   uses STR as a character string with no special interpretation.  This
   is useful for preventing STR from being interpreted as a control
   argument.  It is to be used with the -field_name control argument
   (e.g., "-field_name rating -string -20").
-total, -tt
   displays the number of records modified.


Notes:  The modify_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.
A severity of 2 is set when the modification is not performed, for some
reason other than no records matching the selection expression, or the
invocation of modify_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 1 is
set when the selection expression finds no match.  A severity of 0 is
set when at least one record is modified and the command terminates
normally.
