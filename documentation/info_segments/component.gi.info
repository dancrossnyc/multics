07/30/86  Components (general information)

The term "component" is used with archives and entrynames (i.e.,
archive component and entryname component).


An archive component is one of the files placed in an archive.  The
archive component is separated from the pathname of the archive segment
which contains it by a double colon ("::").  For more information, see
archive_pathname.gi.info.


An entryname component is a logical part of an entryname.  Entryname
components are separated by a period.  For more information about
entrynames, see entryname.gi.info.
