03/13/80	no_save_on_disconnect

Syntax:  no_save_on_disconnect


Function:	 disables process preservation across hangups in the user's
process, causing the process to log itself out automatically if its
terminal channel hangs up.


Notes:  This command is only meaningful if process preservation was in
effect for the process at login time, either by default or because the
-save_on_disconnect control argument was specified on the login command
line.
