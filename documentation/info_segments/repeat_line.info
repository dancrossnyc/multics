10/17/84  repeat_line, rpl

Syntax as a command:  rpl {N} {string}


Function:  allows certain limited testing of the performance of your
interactive terminal by "echoing" an arbitrary message you typed in.


Arguments:
N
   is the number of times the message is to be printed.  If you don't
   give N or if N is 0, its previous value is used; the default
   first-time value is 10.

string
   is the arbitrary message you typed in to be printed.  Quote it if it
   contains blanks.


Notes:  The first time you use repeat_line in a process, a canned
message, consisting of "The quick brown fox..."  (alternate words in
red and black shift), followed by three separate lines, each containing
one horizontal tab character plus ASCII graphics in ascending numeric
sequence, is used.  If you don't supply string, you are requested to
type in a new string.  Once the message to be printed has been
determined, it is printed N times.  (In the case of "The quick brown
fox" message, 4N lines are printed.)  If string is an asterisk, the
previous message is reused.


When printing of the message is completed or when you don't give an
initial message, the line
   Type line (or q or <NL>):
is printed.  Typing only the newline (<NL>) character prints the
previous message another N times.  The lowercase letter q followed by
<NL> returns repeat_line to its caller.  Any other line is interpreted
as a new message to be printed N times.
