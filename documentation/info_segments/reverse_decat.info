Syntax as a command:  rvdecat STRA STRB C


Syntax as an active function:  [rvdecat STRA STRB C]


Function:  performs the same function as the decat command/active
function, but in reverse order.


Notes:  The active function returns the "decatenation" of STRA with
respect to the last occurrence of STRB in STRA (decat uses the first
occurrence).  The value for C is any three-digit bit string expressed
as 0 or as 1 characters such as 000,001,...,111.  The last occurrence
of STRB found in STRA divides STRA into three parts:  the part prior to
STRB, the part matching STRB, and the part following STRB.  Digits of C
correspond to these three parts.  The return string contains the parts
of STRA whose corresponding bit in C is 1.  The parts are returned in
their original order of appearance in STRA.
   [reverse_decat STRA STRB C]
is the same as--
   [reverse [decat [reverse STRA] [reverse STRB] [reverse C]]]
when STRB appears in STRA.  It is also the same as--
   [decat STRA STRB C]
when STRB does not appear in STRA.
