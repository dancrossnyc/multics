08/02/84  unpopulate_mrds_db, umdb

Syntax as a command:  umdb database_path {-control_args}


Function:  This command deletes all existing data stored in the given
data base, returning it to the unpopulated state.  It is primarily a
data base application development tool.


Arguments:
database_path
   is the relative or absolute pathname, with or without suffix, of the
   data base that is to have all tuples in all relations deleted.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   causes the data to be deleted without querying the user.
-no_force, -nfc
   causes the user to be queried as to whether he really wishes to
   delete all data in the data base as a safety measure against
   inadvertently typing in the wrong data base name.  This is the
   default.


Notes:  Only a DBA can use this command.

If there is no data in the data base, no error will be issued.

The command display_mrds_db_population can be used to check the current
tuple count of the relations.
