09/25/88  list_sub_tree, lst

Syntax as a command:  lst {pathnames} {-control_args}


Function: lists the segments in a specified subtree of the hierarchy.
Archives within the subtree can also be listed.


Arguments:
pathnames
   are relative pathnames describing the subtrees to be listed.  The
   star convention and archive pathname convention are supported.  If
   no pathnames are given, the default is the working directory.


Control arguments:
-archives, -archive, -ac
   archives in the subtree should be expanded by listing their
   components.
-depth N, -dh N
   the depth to which each subtree is to be scanned.  The depth is
   relative to the base of the specified subtree.  The depth must be
   specified by a decimal integer.  (default: list the entire subtree)
-exclude NAMES, -ex NAMES
   are star names.  If any name of a subtree entry matches one of these
   star names, that entry is not listed.  See Notes below.


-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret segments and directories as extended entries whenever
   appropriate.  Extended entries whose standard entry type is a
   directory (eg, forum meeting directories) are not expanded into
   subtrees.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret segments and directories as standard entries. (default)
-length, -ln
   list the size (in pages) of each selected entry.  (default)
-match NAMES, -ex NAMES
   are star names.  A subtree entry is listed only if one of its names
   matches one of these star names.  See Notes below.
-names, -name, -nm
   all names of each listed subtree entry are printed.


-no_archives, -no_archive, -nac
   archive components within the subtree are not listed. (default)
-no_exclude, -nex
   no subtree entries are excluded by name.  (default)
-no_length, -nln
   do not list the size of each selected entry.
-no_match, -nmatch
   subtree entries are not selected by star names.  (default)
-no_names, -no_name, -nnm
   only the primary name of each subtree entry is printed. (default)
-no_select_entry_type, -nslet
   do not select entries based upon entry type. (default)


-no_totals, -no_total, -ntt
   do not print a full summary.  Include only the total count of
   entries listed, plus their total pages used if -length was given.
-no_totals_only, -no_total_only, -ntto
   do not include a summary of each type of entry found, do list the
   selected entries. (default)
-no_types, -no_type, -ntp
   do not list the type of selected entries.
-select_entry_type TYPES, -slet TYPES
   selects only entries of the types specified by TYPES, which is one
   or more, possibly comma-delimited file system entry types.  Use the
   list_entry_types command to obtain a list of valid entry type
   values.  See "List of entry types" and "Notes" below.


-totals, -total, -tt
   end the output with a summary of the number of entries of each type
   which were displayed. (default)
-totals_only, -total_only, -tto
   print only the counts of each type of selected entry, do not list
   the entries themselves.
-types, -type, -tp
   list the type of each selected entry. (default)


List of entry types:
   The entry types which may be given with -slet and which are listed
   with selected entries when -type is given include the following.
link, lk
segment, seg, sm
directory, dir, dr
multisegment_file, ms_file, msf
msf_component, msf_comp, ms_comp
dm_file, dmf
archive, arch, ac
archive_component, arch_comp, ac_comp


   The suffix of any extended entry type may be given, if -inaee is
   also specified.  Use the list_entry_types (lset) command for a
   complete list of extended entry types.  Some of these are:
bj
forum
mbx
mcacs
ms
pnt


Notes: For each level in the hierarchy listed, the names are indented
three more spaces to indicate which segments exist at each depth of the
subtree.  By default, each printed entry begins with an entry type and
number of pages used by the entry.


-match, -exclude and -slet may be given several times to specify more
than one star name or entry type, or several operands may follow each
control argument.  All arguments following -match, -exclude or -slet
are treated as operands until an argument beginning with a minus sign
(-) or containing a less-than (<) or greater-than (>) character is
encountered.  A minus would begin a new control argument; a less-than
or greater-than character would appear in a pathname argument.


Several entry types may also be given with a single -slet control
argument, by separating type names with commas.  For example:
    -slet sm,dir
