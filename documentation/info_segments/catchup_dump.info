08/21/2018 catchup_dump

Syntax as a command:  catchup_dump {ctl_file {operator {ntapes {int}}}}
   {-control_args}


Function:  begins a catchup hierarchy dump.  It dumps all storage
system segments and directories which have been modified since a
specified date and time (the default is midnight two days prior).  The
catchup_dump command calls the backup_dump command to do the actual
dumping.


The catchup_dump command requires a dump control file, containing the
full pathnames of the objects to be dumped.  It calls backup_dump once
for each line in the control file.  See "Notes on Format of a Dump
Control File" below.  When the control file is exhausted, i.e., when
the catchup dump pass is finished, the catchup_dump command starts up
the incremental hierarchy dumper in the same manner as the start_dump
command.  (Incremental and catchup hierarchy dumps are normally
performed by the same process.)  You can prevent this by using the
-nocontin control argument.  A map of all objects dumped is created in
the working directory, with the name <unique-name>.dump.map.

If you don't specify the -debug control argument, catchup_dump
increases the scheduling priority of the dumping process by calling
hphcs_$set_timax with a value of 7000000.


The catchup_dump command is one of the commands used to control
hierarchy dumping of storage system segments and directories to
magnetic tape.  The other commands are:

   backup_dump
   complete_dump
   end_dump
   start_dump
   wakeup_dump


You should note that argument processing for all of the hierarchy
backup commands is performed by a common argument processing procedure.
The values of all arguments are remembered in static storage and remain
in effect for the life of the process, unless changed by arguments
given in subsequent invocations of backup commands.  It should also be
noted that the dumping commands and the reloading/retrieving commands
are all part of the same hierarchy backup system, and argument values
set by the dumping commands remain in effect for the
reloading/retrieving commands and vice versa, unless overridden.
However, dumping and reloading cannot be done in the same process; use
the new_proc command between dumping and reloading.  See "Notes on
Default Arguments" below.


You may define certain frequently used arguments to the catchup_dump
command in two different ways.  The first way is to precede the
argument with an identifying control argument.  The second way is to
place the argument in a certain position on the command line.  In the
first case, the combination of control argument and argument may appear
anywhere on the command line after any positional information.  In the
second case, the argument must appear at the beginning of the command
line, before any control argument-argument combinations or any control
arguments which stand alone.


For the catchup_dump command, the frequently used arguments are the
control file, the operator's name, the number of tape copies, and the
wakeup interval.  When defined to the command positionally, i.e.,
without identifying control arguments, these arguments must appear in
the following positions:

      catchup_dump {ctl_file {operator {ntapes {int}}}} {-control_args}

The control file and the operator's name must be specified, in one way
or the other.


Arguments:
ctl_file
   is the pathname of the dump control file (see the -control control
   argument).
operator
   is the operator's name or initials (see the -operator control
   argument).
ntapes
   is the number of copies to be made of each hierarchy dump tape (see
   the -tapes control argument).
int
   is the wakeup interval (see the -wakeup control argument).


Control arguments:
-all
   causes all directory entries (in the specified subtree) to be
   dumped, regardless of their dates modified or dates dumped.  This
   argument overrides a previously given -dtd control argument or DATE
   argument.  This is the default.
-brief_map, -bfmap
   creates a map file that lists the processed entries.
-contin
   causes catchup_dump to start the incremental hierarchy dumper after
   the catchup pass is finished.  This is the default.


-control path
   indicates that path is the pathname of a dump control file.  The
   suffix "dump" is assumed.  For example, "-control sys_dirs"
   specifies a control file named sys_dirs.dump, in the working
   directory.  See "Notes on Format of a Dump Control File" below.
-debug
   disables those phcs_ and hphcs_ calls that deactivate dumped
   segments and set quotas.
-destination STR, -ds STR
   specifies a destination for printing maps and error files.  The
   default is "incremental" for maps and "error file" for error files.
-dtd
   tests and dumps each segment only if the segment or its branch has
   been modified since the last time it was dumped.


-error_off
   writes error messages into a file rather than online.  The name of
   the error file is printed when the first error is encountered.  This
   is the default.
-error_on
   writes error messages on the user's terminal.
-header STR, -he STR
   specifies a heading for dprinting maps and error files.
-hold
   leaves the current hierarchy dump tape or tapes mounted and inhibits
   rewinding after the current hierarchy dump cycle is completed.
-map
   writes a list of the segments and directories processed into a file.
   This is the default.


-nocontin
   prevents catchup_dump from starting the incremental hierarchy dumper
   after the catchup pass is finished.
-nodebug
   enables hphcs_ calls to set quotas and the transparency switches.
   This is the default.
-nohold
   rewinds and unloads the hierarchy dump tape or tapes at the end of
   the current dump pass.  This is the default.
-nomap
   inhibits listing of the names of processed segments and directories
   and turns the tape switch on (see -tape below).
-nooutput
   inhibits writing hierarchy dump information even if the tape switch
   is on.  This is used for a test run or debugging.


-noprimary, -npri
   uses each pathname as given.  The default is -primary.
-notape
   inhibits writing of a hierarchy tape.  This argument also causes a
   map to be created even if it was previously inhibited.  (See -map
   above.)
-only
   indicates that only the requested segment or directory and its
   branch are to be dumped.  This is the opposite of -sweep.
-operator STR
   indicates that STR is the user's name or initials (up to 16
   characters in length).
-output
   writes hierarchy dump information onto the tape if the tape switch
   is on.  This is the default.


-primary, -pr
   replaces all directory names in each pathname with the primary
   names.  This is the default.
-pvname STR
   indicates that segments and directories may only be dumped if they
   reside on the physical volume specified by STR.
-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   specifies an output request type for printing maps and error files.
   Available request types can be listed by using the
   print_request_types command.  The default is "printer."
-restart path
   indicates that path is the pathname of a segment or directory where
   hierarchy dumping is to be restarted.  Use of this feature assumes
   that there is a dump control file.  It is normally used to restart a
   hierarchy dump that was interrupted by a system failure.


-sweep
   indicates that the whole subtree beginning with the given directory
   is to be dumped, subject to the criteria of the -dtd control
   argument or the DATE argument if either has been invoked.  This is
   the default.
-tape
   allows writing of a tape.  This is the default.
-tapes N
   indicates that N is the number of output tape copies to be made
   where N can be either 1 or 2.  The default is 1.
-volume_pool path, -vp path
   indicates that the specified volume pool should be used to provide
   automated selection of tapes to use for dumping. See the
   manage_volume_pool (mvp) command for help on managing volume
   pools.


-no_volume_pool, -no_vp
   disables use of a volume pool for automatic tape selection.
-1tape
   sets the number of tape copies to 1 as an alternative to the -tapes
   argument.
-2tapes
   sets the number of tape copies to 2 as an alternative to the -tapes
   argument.
-wakeup N
   indicates that N is the wakeup interval between incremental
   hierarchy dump passes, in minutes.  The default is 60 minutes.


DATE
   an argument beginning with a character other than "-" or ">" is
   assumed to be a date, in a format acceptable to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If the argument can be
   converted to a date, then only segments and directories modified
   after that date are dumped.


Notes on default arguments:  The values of arguments given to any of
the hierarchy backup commands are remembered in static storage and
remain in effect for the life of the process, unless explicitly changed
during the invocation of a subsequent backup command.


The following defaults are in effect for the dumper before any backup
commands are given; they are not, however, reset to these values at the
start of each backup command, except as noted.

   -all
   -contin
   -error_of
   -map
   -nodebug
   -nohold
   -output
   -primary
   -sweep
   -tape


The following defaults are set automatically at the time the respective
commands are executed:

      catchup_dump
           -tape
            (default date yesterday at midnight)

      complete_dump
           -all
           -tape

      start_dump
           -dtd


           -hold
           -tape
           -wakeup 60



Notes on format of a dump control file:  The control file specified by
"-control path" is an ASCII segment containing absolute pathnames of
entries (segments, MSFs, and directory subtrees) to be dumped, each on
a separate line.
