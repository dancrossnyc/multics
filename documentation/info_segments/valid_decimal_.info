:Entry:  valid_decimal_: 03/08/85  valid_decimal_


Function:
The valid_decimal_ subroutine tests decimal data for validity.


Syntax:
declare valid_decimal_ entry (fixed bin, ptr, fixed bin) returns
     (bit(1));
b = valid_decimal_ (dtype, dptr, dprec);


Arguments:
dtype
   is the data type descriptor of the decimal data.  It must be one of
   the following:  9-12, 29, 30, 35-36, 38-39, 41-46 81-84.  (Input)
dptr
   is a pointer to the data to be tested for validity.  (Input)
dprec
   is the precision of the data.  (Input)
b
   is the value returned by valid_decimal_.  It is "1"b if the data is
   valid, "0"b otherwise.  (Output)


Notes:
For decimal data to be valid, it must pass the following tests:
(1)  The precision must be > 0 and <= 59;
(2)  The data type descriptor must be one handled by valid_decimal_;
(3)  If the data is stored as nonoverpunched 9-bit characters, then if
     it has a sign, then the sign must be either "+" or "-".  The
     digits must all be one of the ASCII characters "0123456789";
(4)  If the data is stored as overpunched 9-bit characters, then the
     sign character must be either octal 173, 175, or in the range 101
     to 122.  The remaining digits must all be one of the ASCII
     characters "0123456789";
(5)  If the data is stored as 4-bit characters, then if it has a sign,
     then sign must be in the range "1010"b to "1111"b.  All digits
     must be in the range "0000"b to "1001"b.
