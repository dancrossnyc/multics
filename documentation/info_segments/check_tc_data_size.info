84-07-19:  check_tc_data_size

Syntax:  check_tc_data_size {-control_args}


Function: displays the sizes of the Active Process Table (APT) and
Inter-process Transmission Table (ITT) that are allocated in the
tc_data segment.  The sizes of these data bases are controlled by the
values found on the TCD configuration card.  This command is useful to
determine if a proposed change to the TCD values will cause the
tc_data segment to become larger than 255 pages.  It is also useful to
help fill in the last page of the tc_data segment through manipulation
of either of the values on the TCD card.


Control arguments:
-apt N
   specifies that the APT is to have N entries.

-itt N
   specifies that the ITT is to have N entries.

-pathname STR, -pn STR
   specifies that the configuration deck with a pathname of STR is to
   be used.


Notes:
If either of the -apt or -itt control arguments are not used, a
configuration deck will be used to supply the missing values.

The configuration deck, if needed, is found with the user's search
rules if the -pathname option is not used in the command line.
