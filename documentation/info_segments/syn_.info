03/31/83  syn_


Function: This I/O module may be used to attach an I/O switch, x, as a
synonym for another switch, y.  Thereafter, performing an operation
other than attach or detach on x has the same effect as performing it
on y.  There is one exception: if the attach description specifies
that an operation on y is to be inhibited, performing that operation
on x results in an error code.

Entry points in the module are not called directly by users:  rather
the module is accessed through the I/O system.  See the Programmer's
Reference Manual for a general description of the input/output system
and a discussion of synonym attachments.


Syntax and Attach Description:
     syn_ switch_name {-control_arg}


Arguments:
switch_name
   is the name of the I/O switch, y, for which the attached switch, x,
   is to be a synonym.


Control arguments:
-inhibit names, -inh names
   specifies which I/O operations are to be inhibited.  The name
   arguments are separated by spaces and must be chosen from the
   following:
            open                close
            get_line            put_chars
            get_chars           write_record
            read_record         delete_record
            rewrite_record      position
            read_length         read_key
            seek_key            modes
            control


Switch Operation:  The detach operation detaches the switch x (the
switch attached via syn_).  It has no effect on the switch y for which
x is a synonym.


Inhibited Operations:  An inhibited operation returns the code
error_table_$no_operation.
