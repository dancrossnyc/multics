Description

14  phx19395
io_error_summary is not reporting the tape-data-bit-in-error counts
properly when the -tdbie argument is selected.

13  phx18710
The command line:
   ! monitor_cache
 can cause unpredictible faults because of an uninitialized variable.  To fix
 change line 171 from:
     amonitor_interval = DEFAULT_INTERVAL * 60000000;
     to:
     amonitor_interval, factor_dividend = DEFAULT_INTERVAL * 60000000;

8  phx14813
After an "Unrecoverable Error" has occurred and the user continues, the
sector addresses are not getting properly incremented for the RANGE and
SEQUENTIAL modes.

7  phx14740
The control arguments -random or -sequential, if given after the range
arguments -from and -to, will cause the entire pack to be tested.  The
program should continue to use the range supplied, but change the mode
of testing from RANGE, to RANDOM or SEQUENTIAL.  Also a new argument
should be created to specify the range mode, -range.
