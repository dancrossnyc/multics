:Entry:  terminal_iocb:  03/19/85 video_data_$terminal_iocb


Function:  This is the terminal control switch IOCB pointer.  If the
video system is activated for the user's terminal, this pointer is
nonnull, and points to the IOCB for the switch user_terminal_.


declare video_data_$terminal_iocb pointer external static;


Notes:
User programs may use this pointer for two purposes:

1. Inquiring as to whether the video system is activated, by checking
   to see if the pointer is null.

2. Determining the physical characteristics and capabilities of the
   terminal.  This may be accomplished with the get_capabilities
   control order, described under the window_io_ I/O module.  The
   height and width returned will be that of the physical terminal
   screen.

   No other manipulations of this switch are permitted.
