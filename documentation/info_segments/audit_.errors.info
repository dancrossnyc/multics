Description

55  phx19369
audit_ modes operation should always get the modes from the audited
switch, even when the input mode string only contains audit_* modes.

54  phx18082
When using an audit file with size = N, a single iox_$put_chars of more
than N records fails when audit_ attempts to store the audit entry
(audit_ loops infinitely).

53  phx17740
"ata;daf" gets an audit_file_position_ error.

51  phx14134
Attempting to set a mode when auditing is suspended causes audit_ to
report an error directly, rather than just return an error code.

50  phx14207, phx18196
attach_audit silently leaves one at a new command level when an RQO is
encountered setting up the audit file.

48  phx17285
audit_ detach can exit with IPS signals masked.

46  , phx15947
daf gets size condition when displaying metering data.

45  phx15870, phx15879
attach_audit doesn't generate sufficiently unique switch names,
invocations in rapid succession cause it to try and use the same
switch.

42  phx14441
Setting ^audit_suspend should have no effect if auditing is not
suspended.

35  phx12131
audit_attach doesn't work on zero-length audit files.

34  phx12044
audit_use_editor_prompt mode can no longer be turned off via the modes
operation.

28  phx02985
Strings used by -fm -to -next -last -match are interpreted as qedx
expressions, this isn't mentioned in any of the documentation.

27  phx02985
The error codes returned by search_file_ are not converted into
meaningful error messages for the user. Code 1 returned by search_file_
in audit_file_position_ are erroneously converted into
error_table_$nomatch. Code 2 returned by search_file in daf is

25  phx11796
Attempt to attach_audit with an audit file on an unattached logical
file causes an OOB.

24  phx11785
No documentation of what happens when an unrecognized audit_ request is
provided. (The entire line including the bogus audit request is simply
passed through, like a normal line of input.)

22  phx10278
If the pathname for the output file for daf is bad, daf gets an
ios_error.

21  phx09948
audit_ has a bad interaction with pl1 IO, only in absentee.

20  phx09525, phx09540
daf doesn't identify which argument is unacceptable.

19  phx09645
audit should translate arguments to -class to upper class and validate
them for rectitude.

17  phx08730
!r (audit replay request) seems to cause an ios_error when a replayed
line is filled out to greater than 128 characters and passed to
listen_.

14  
daf doesn't close the vfile when doing an -of.

12  phx03788
Large audit files cause daf and the editor to loop.
Audit_file_position_ loses.

11  phx03788
Random reference to word in page 119 of audit files when records used
is much smaller "(e.g., 19)".

10  phx03788
detach_audit should set the bit count on the audit file.

9  phx06855
ata -of foo responds with error_table_$argerr instead of bad_opt.

8  phx08138
When an audit file becomes an MSF, audit_ gets a bounds fault and the
audit file is unuseable. This may have something to do with transparent
mode.

7  phx08303
truncating an audit file causes the audit file to become an MSF with a
bogus size, after its next use.

6  
daf trims trailing whitespace from entries when displaying them.

5  phx03788, phx07213
nonexistent error codes are referenced, daf references duparg and
audit_file_position_ references incompatible_operaitions.

4  phx07322
Empty audit filescan't be daf'ed (ata;daf loops)

3  
-tc arg to attach_audit trashes audit file.

2  
audit editor request parsing mishandles extra blanks.

1  
daf prefixes output with a blank.
