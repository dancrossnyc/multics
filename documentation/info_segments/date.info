02/08/85  date

Syntax as a command:  date {time_string} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [date {time_string} {-control_arg}]


Function: returns a date of the form "mm/dd/yy" (e.g., "12/23/82").
The format string to produce this is "^my/^dm/^yc".


Arguments:
time_string
   indicates the date about which information is desired.  If you
   supply no time_string, the current date is used.  The time string is
   concatenated to form a single argument even if it contains spaces;
   you need not quote it.  (See time_strings.gi for a description of
   valid time_string values.)


Control arguments:
-zone STR
   STR specifies the zone that is to be used to express the result.
   (Default: the process default)


Notes: Use the print_time_defaults command to display the default
zone.  Use the display_time_info command to display a list of all
acceptable zone values.

Due to exec_coms, etc., that have been built around the expected date
format, this command does not honor the process date format (set by
set_time_default).  You are encouraged to use "clock date" instead of
date to get the proper default handling.
