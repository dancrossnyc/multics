06/20/80	ready, rdy

Syntax:  rdy


Function:	 types out an up-to-date ready message whose format is
optionally set by the general_ready command.  The default ready message
if general_ready is not used gives the time of day and the amount of
CPU time and page faults used since the last ready message was typed.
If the user is not at the first command level, i.e., if some
computation has been suspended and the stack frames involved not
released, the default ready message also contains the number of the
current command level.


Notes:  See the descriptions of ready_on, ready_off, and general_ready
in MPM Commands and Active Functions, AG92.
