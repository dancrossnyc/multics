Syntax as a command:  le paths {-control arguments}


Function:   Joins a  series of   object segments together into  a
single  execution  unit  resolving  external  references  to  the
explicitly named segments or segments within the named libraries.


Arguments:

paths
   specifications of the input binaries  which are to be included
   in the output binary.  Valid  formats for a path specification
   are:


Archive
   Library  archives  are   unbound  archives  containing  object
   segments which may be used to resolve external references.  To
   specify  a  library  archive,  the  ".archive"  suffix must be
   included in the name.
Directory
   Library  directories  may  be  specified  which  contain loose
   object segments to  which external references may be resolved.
   Any archives found in the directory will be expanded  and  all
   the components included.


Pathname
   Pathnames  to specific segments  or archive components  may be
   specified.
Starname
   Starnames  specifying  groups  of  loose   segments  within  a
   directory may  be specified, or an  archive component starname
   specifying a set of components within a particular archive.  A
   starname that includes archives will expand each archive.


Control arguments:

-abort_severity severity, -asv severity
   specifies the error  severity at which the execution should be
   terminated and must be in the range 0 to 3.  Severity 4 errors
   are not recoverable and are  terminated  immediately.  See the
   notes below for  a description  of  error severities.   If  no
   abort severity is specified, a value of 3  is used.   An abort
   severity of 0 will generate the tables and attempt  to resolve
   links but will stop before generating any output.

-automatic_segnames, -asn
   specifies that entrypoint names are to be automatically  added
   to the containing block as segnames so that a reference to the
   entrypoint  name alone  will resolve  to  the  correct  block.
   (Default)

-component_size pages, -compsz pages
   specifies the maximum number of pages which a single component
   of the  output object should  contain.  This value  is used to
   determine  at what  point the  transition is  made from single
   segment to  MSF and the  size of an  individual MSF component.
   If  this control  argument is  not specified,  a value  of 255
   pages is used.


-delete {entrypoint}, -dl {entrypoint}
   deletes the  named entrypoint from  the output binary.   If no
   entrypoint  name is  given, all  entrypoints will  be deleted,
   with  the exception  of the   definition for  "main_" and  its
   associated  segnames,  if  present.   This  definition  can be
   removed with an explicit -delete main_ control argument.

-display_severity severity, -dsv severity
   sets the display severity  to  the given  value.   The display
   severity is  the minimum  severity error  which  will cause  a
   message to be displayed.   Display severity  must  be  in  the
   range from 1 to 5.  The default value is 1.

-force, -fc
   suppresses the  query before overwriting a  non-object segment
   or an object segment created by a translator.


-library library_specification, -lb library_specification
   specifies  one  or  more  object  library  routines  which the
   linkage editor  will use to resolve  external references.  The
   library specification is in the same form and is  evaluated in
   the same manner as the input path specification.

-list, -ls
   create a listing specifying what segments were involved in the
   creation of the linked segment,  the disposition of each input
   component,  and a list of the retained links and  definitions.
   The name of the listing segment will be the same as the output
   binary with a .list suffix appended.


-map
   Create  a map  of the   input components  and where  they were
   placed.  The name  of the listing segment will be  the same as
   the output binary with a .list suffix appended.

-no_automatic_segnames, -nasn
   do not add entrypoint names to the containing block as segname
   definitions.  This is the same behaviour  as  the  binder  and
   requires that entrypoints be referenced with the name  of  the
   containing module (i.e. segment$entrypoint)  in  order  to  be
   resolved internally.

-no_force, -nfc
   query  before overwriting a  non-object segment, or  an object
   created by a translator.  (Default)

-no_list, -nls
   do not produce a listing segment.  (Default)

-no_version, -nvers
   do not print out the version of the linkage editor.


-output_file pathname, -of pathname
   specifies the pathname of the  output binary to be created.  If
   no -output_file  argument is given, the output  binary will be
   created in the working directory  with the name a.out.  Before
   generating the output, the linkage editor will check to insure
   that  the  target  either  does  not  exist,  or  was  a bound
   object prior to  overwriting.  If the target is not an object,
   or was not created by  the linkage_editor,  the  user  will be
   queried before it is overwritten unless the -force argument is
   given.


-retain entrypoint, -ret entrypoint
   specifies  an   entrypoint  that  should  be   retained.   The
   entrypoint  is  given  in  the  form  segname$entryname.   The
   entrypoint  is   found  by  conventional  methods,   and  that
   definition  and all  segname  definitions  for that  block are
   retained  in  the  final  output.   If  no  -retain or -delete
   argument  is  given,  all  segnames  and  entrypoints  will be
   retained.   If  any  -retain  arguments  are  given, all other
   entrypoint  and segname definitions  will be deleted,  with the
   exception  of  a  "main_"  definition  which  will  always  be
   retained, along  with its associated segnames,  unless deleted
   with an explicit -delete main_ control argument.

-version, -vers
   prints out  the version of the linkage  editor before linking.
   (Default)


Notes:

When specifying an entrypoint with a -retain  or  -delete option,
the entrypoint name given is treated as a pair of starnames.  One
starname for the segname portion and one for the entrypoint name
portion.  Parts of the entrypoint not given are assumed to be **.
If -retain arguments are supplied but no -delete arguments,  then
a  global  -delete  is  assumed.  Otherwise  a  global -retain is
assumed.


When determining which -retain or -delete option to apply  to any
given definition, the most rules are applied:
 1) The most specific rule is applied first.  The following order
    determines what is the most specific rule

        most specific:  explicit segname and entrypoint
		    star segname and explicit entrypoint
		    any segname and explicit entrypoint
		    explicit segname and star entrypoint
		    star segname and entrypoint
		    any segname and star entrypoint
		    explicit segname and any entrypoint
		    star segname and any entrypoint
        least specific: any segname and entrypoint


    where "any" name refers to a star name which matches any name
    and "star" name refers to a star name which is ambiguous (ie.
    contains * or ? characters) but does not match all names, and
    "explicit" name refers to a name with no * or ? characters.


 2) entrypoint specs with the same class above, are ordered based
    on the order they occurred  in the input.  If  two  starnames
    both match a  given entrypoint,  the first one given  on  the
    command line will be used.


Examples:
  -retain bar$foo		= -retain bar$foo
  -retain foo		= -retain **$foo
  -retain bar$		= -retain bar$**
  -retain			= -retain **$**
  -retain b??$		= -retain b??$**


Notes on severity values:

The linkage_editor  command  associates  the  following  severity
values to be used by the severity active function:

Value	Meaning
  0	No error.
  1	Warning.
  2	Correctable error.
  3	Fatal error.
  4	Unrecoverable error.
