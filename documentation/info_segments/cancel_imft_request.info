04/11/83  cancel_imft_request, cir

Syntax:  cir request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function: cancels requests in the Inter-Multics File Transfer queues.


Arguments:
request_identifiers
   determine which requests in the selected queues
   (-queue/-all/-ds/-sc) belonging to the specified users (-own/-user)
   are cancelled.  See "Notes on request identifiers" below.


List of request_identifiers:
path
   cancels all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source pathnames match the relative pathname path.  The star
   convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   cancels all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source entry names match STR; the directory portions of the source
   pathnames are ignored.  The star convention is allowed.
-id STR
   cancels all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   request IDs match the STR.  Type "help request_ids.gi" for a
   description of the syntax of STR.


Control arguments:
-destination STR, -ds STR
   cancels requests that are queued for transfer to the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.
-source STR, -sc STR
   cancels requests that are queued for transfer from the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.  If neither -destination nor -source is
   specified, the default is -destination imft.
-queue N, -q N
   cancels requests entered in priority queue N for the above
   destination or source where N is an integer between 1 and 4
   inclusive.  (Default -- depends on the destination or source
   specified)
-all, -a
   cancels requests entered in all priority queues for the above
   destination or source.


-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling that a particular request identifier did
   not match any requests or that requests were cancelled when using
   star names or the -all control argument.
-long, -lg
   displays the above messages. (Default)
-own
   cancels a matching request only if it was submitted by the user of
   this command.  (Default)
-user STR
   cancels a matching request only if it was submitted by the user
   identified by STR.


List of user specifications:
   the STR given to the -user control argument must have one of the
   following forms:
Person.Project
   cancels only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on the specified project.
Person.*, Person
   cancels only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on any project.
*.Project, .Project
   cancels only those matching requests entered by any user logged in
   on the specified project.
*.*, *
   cancels all matching requests regardless of who entered them.


Access required: If -user is specified, the user must have at least
"rd" extended access to the queue; otherwise, the user must have at
least "o" extended access.


Notes on request identifiers: Multiple -id STR request identifiers may
be specified on the command line only if no path or -entry STR
identifiers are given.

If path or -entry STR request identifiers are given, only one -id STR
request identifier may be given in which case only those requests which
match one of the path or -entry STR identifiers and which match the
-id STR identifier are cancelled.

If a path or -entry STR request identifier matches more than one
request and is not a starname, a message is printed telling how many
matching requests were found but none of the requests are cancelled.
The -id STR request identifier may be used to further qualify the path
or -entry STR identifier to select the specific request to cancel.


Notes: If the request is already being transferred, this command will
print a message and refuse to delete the entry from the queue.  The
user will have to contact the operations staff to cancel the transfer.

If conflicting control arguments (eg: -long and -brief, or -destination
and -source) are given on the command line, the rightmost control
argument takes effect.
