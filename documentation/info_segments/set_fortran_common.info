Syntax as a command:  sfc paths {-control_arg}


Function:  initializes common storage for a FORTRAN run.  Supply as an
argument every object file that is part of the FORTRAN run to ensure
that the common blocks are properly initialized.  This command allows
you to specify the files containing the block data subprograms prior
to the run.


Arguments:
paths
 is a list of pathnames of files containing block data subprograms
   that initialize common.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   prints a message if a referenced common block has already been
   allocated.


Notes:  This command is useful in the run exec_com, which initializes
the environment for a FORTRAN run.

Due to dynamic linking in Multics, if the first program to reference a
common block is not compiled or bound with the block data subprogram
that initializes the common block, this block may not be successfully
initialized.

Any common blocks referenced in the specified files are allocated
(if necessary) and initialized.  If no initialization information is
associated with the referenced common block, it is initialized to
binary zeroes.  If a common block was previously allocated, it is
effectively deleted and reinitialized.
