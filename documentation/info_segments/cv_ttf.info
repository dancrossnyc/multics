04/05/84  cv_ttf

Syntax:  cv_ttf path {-control_arg}


Function:  compiles a terminal type file (TTF) into a terminal type
table (TTT) for installation.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the TTF to be compiled.  It must have the ttf
   suffix.  The resulting TTT is placed in your working directory; its
   entryname is the same as the entryname of the TTF with the ttt
   suffix added.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints all error messages produced by cv_ttf in short form.
-long, -lg
   prints all error messages produced by cv_ttf in long form.
-severity N, -sv N
   does not write error messages whose severity is less than N (where N
   is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) to the user_output switch.  If not given, a
   severity level of 0 is assumed; i.e., all error messages are written
   to the user_output switch.  (See "Notes on severity values.")


Notes:  If neither -brief nor -long is selected, the first instance of
a given error produces a long message and all subsequent instances of
that error produce short messages.


Notes on severity values:  This command associates the following
severity values to be used by the severity active function:

     VALUE            MEANING
       0       No compilation yet or no error
       1       Warning
       2       Correctable error
       3       Fatal error
       4       Unrecoverable error
       5       Could not find source
