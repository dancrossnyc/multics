04/05/84  deactivate_seg

Syntax:  deactivate_seg path {-control_arg}


Function:  allows you to deactivate a segment or directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment or directory to be deactivated or a
   segment number.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   deactivates the segment or directory, if possible, by using the
   highly privileged demand_deactivate entry.


Access required:  This command requires access to the phcs_ gate; if
-force is used, it requires access to the hphcs_ gate.


Notes:  If -force is not supplied, the segment or directory is only
deactivated if all processes connected to it have the allow_deactivate
attribute set (see the change_kst_attributes command).  If -force is
specified, the segment is deactivated unless its entry hold switch is
set and the directory is deactivated unless it has active inferiors.
