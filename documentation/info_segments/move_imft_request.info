04/11/83  move_imft_request, mir

Syntax:  mir request_identifiers -control_args


Function: moves requests from one Inter-Multics File Transfer (IMFT)
queue to another.  The move can be between queues of the same remote
system or between queues of different remote systems.  The requests are
always placed at the end of the target queue.


Arguments:
request_identifiers
   determine which requests in the selected queues (-queue/-all/-ds/-sc)
   belonging to the specified users (-own/-user) are moved.  See "Notes
   on request identifiers" below.


List of request_identifiers:
path
   moves all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source pathnames match the relative pathname path.  The star
   convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   moves all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source entry names match STR; the directory portions of the source
   pathnames are ignored.  The star convention is allowed.
-id STR
   moves all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   request IDs match the STR.  Type "help request_ids.gi" for a
   description of the syntax of STR.


Control arguments:
-destination STR, -ds STR
   moves requests that are queued for transfer to the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.
-source STR, -sc STR
   moves requests that are queued for transfer from the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.  If neither -destination nor -source is
   specified, the default is -destination imft.
-queue N, -q N
   moves requests entered in priority queue N for the above destination
   or source where N is an integer between 1 and 4 inclusive.  (Default
   -- depends on the destination or source specified)   
-all, -a
   moves requests entered in all priority queues for the above
   destination or source.  If the move is between queues of the same
   remote system, the target queue is not searched.


-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling that a particular request identifier did
   not match any requests or providing the new request IDs of the moved
   requests.
-long, -lg
   displays the above messages. (Default)


-to_destination STR, -tods STR
   specifies that the requests should be moved to the output queues of
   the remote system identified by STR.  This control argument cannot
   be specified if -source is specified.  (Default -- requests are
   moved within the queues of the remote system given by the -ds STR
   control argument)
-to_source STR, -tosc STR
   specifies that the requests should be moved to the input queues of
   the remote system identified by STR.  This control argument cannot
   be specified unless -source is also specified.  (Default -- requests
   are moved within the queues of the remote system given by the -sc
   STR control argument)   
-to_queue N, -tq N
   specifies that the requests be moved to priority queue N of the
   target destination or source where N is an integer between 1 and 4
   inclusive.  (Default -- the default queue of the target destination
   or source)


-own
   moves a matching request only if it was submitted by the user of
   this command.  (Default)
-user STR
   moves a matching request only if it was submitted by the user
   identified by STR.


List of user specifications:
   the STR given to the -user control argument must have one of the
   following forms:
Person.Project
   moves only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on the specified project.
Person.*, Person
   moves only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on any project.
*.Project, .Project
   moves only those matching requests entered by any user logged in
   on the specified project.
*.*, *
   moves all matching requests regardless of who entered them.


Access required: The user must have at least "a" extended access to the
target queue.  If -own (the default) is specified, the user must have
at least "o" extended access to the source queues.  If -user is
specified, the user must have at least "rd" extended access to the
source queues and access to the queue_admin_ gate.  If the user has AIM
ring one privelege, the AIM attributes of the original submittor are
preserved; otherwise, the AIM attributes of the current process are
used.


Notes on request identifiers: Multiple -id STR request identifiers may
be specified on the command line only if no path or -entry STR
identifiers are given.

If path or -entry STR request identifiers are given, only one -id STR
request identifier may be given in which case only those requests which
match one of the path or -entry STR identifiers and which match the
-id STR identifier are moved.

If a path or -entry STR request identifier matches more than one
request and is not a starname, a message is printed telling how many
matching requests were found but none of the requests are moved.  The
-id STR request identifier may be used to further qualify the path or
-entry STR identifier to select the specific request to be moved.


Notes: If the request is already being transferred, this command will
print a message and refuse to move the request.

If conflicting control arguments (eg: -long, -brief) are given on the
command line, the rightmost control argument takes effect.
