:Entry: virtual_cpu_time_: 02/03/84  virtual_cpu_time_


Function: returns the CPU time used by the calling process since its
creation; this value does not include the time spent handling page
faults or system interrupts.  It is therefore a measure of the CPU
time within a process that is independent of other processes, current
configuration, and overhead necessary to implement the virtual memory
for the calling process.


Syntax:
declare virtual_cpu_time_ entry returns (fixed bin(71));
time = virtual_cpu_time_ ();


Arguments:
time
   is the virtual CPU time, in microseconds, used by the calling
   process.  (Output)


Notes:  The vclock builtin function should be used in PL/I programs
instead of this subroutine, because it is more efficient.
