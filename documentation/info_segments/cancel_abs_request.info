02/06/85  cancel_abs_request, car

Syntax as a command:  car request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function: allows you to delete a request for an absentee computation
that is no longer needed.


Arguments:
   you can chose request_identifiers from the following:
path
   is the full or relative pathname for the absentee input segment of
   requests to be canceled.  You can use the star convention.
-entry STR, -et STR
   identifies requests to be canceled by STR, the entryname portion of
   the absentee input segment pathname.  You can use the star
   convention.
-id ID
   identifies one or more requests to be canceled by request
   identifier.  You can give this identifier to further define any path
   or -entry identifier (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   searches all priority queues for the specified request type starting
   with the highest priority queue and ending with the lowest.  It is
   incompatible with -queue.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling that a particular request identifier was
   not found or that requests were canceled when using star names or
   -all.
-foreground, -fg
   specifies that the foreground absentee queue contains the request(s)
   to be canceled.


-queue N, -q N
   specifies that queue N of the request type contains the requests to
   be canceled, where N is a decimal integer specifying the number of
   the queue.  If you omit it, all the queues are searched.
-sender STR
   specifies that only requests from sender STR should be canceled.
   You must also give one or more request identifiers.  In most cases
   the sender is an RJE station identifier.
-user User_id
   specifies the name of the submitter of the request to be canceled if
   it is not the same as the group identifier of the process.  You can
   give the User_id as Person_id.Project_id, Person_id, or .Project_id.
   Both r and d extended access to the queue are required.  This
   control argument is primarily for operators and administrators.


Access required: You need o extended access to the queue to cancel
your own request and r and d extended access to cancel somebody else's
request.


Notes: If you supply -id, only one path or -entry is allowed.  If you
give -id in addition to a path or -entry, they must match the same
request.  If you provide any path or -entry STR request identifiers,
only one -id ID request identifier is accepted and it must match any
requests selected by path or entryname.

You can supply multiple -id ID identifiers in a single command
invocation only if you give no path or entry request identifiers.  The
-queue, -foreground, and -all control arguments are mutually
incompatible.

Normally, deletion can be made only by the user who originated the
request.


When star names are not used and a single request identifier matches
more than one request in the queue(s) searched, none of the requests
are canceled.  However, a message is printed telling how many matching
requests there are.

If the absentee process has already logged in, the user is given the
choice of bumping the job and cancelling the request from the queue, or
allowing the job to continue running and remain in the queue.  This
allows the user to cancel a running absentee process.  When a running
absentee process is canceled by a user or an operator, the message
"Process terminated by the system.  The reason will be sent by Multics
mail."  will appear in the absentee output segment.
