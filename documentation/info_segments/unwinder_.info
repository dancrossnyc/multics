:Entry: unwinder_: 02/03/84  unwinder_


Function: is used to perform a nonlocal goto on the Multics stack.  It
is not intended to be called by direct programming (i.e., an explicit
call statement in a program) but rather, by the generated code of a
translator.  For example, it is automatically invoked by a PL/I goto
statement involving a nonlocal label variable.


Syntax:
declare unwinder_ entry (label);
call unwinder_ (tag);


Arguments:
tag
   is a nonlocal label variable.  (Input)


Notes: When invoked, the unwinder_ subroutine traces the Multics stack
backward until it finds the stack frame associated with its label
variable argument or until the stack is exhausted.  In each stack
frame it passes, it invokes the handler (if any) for the cleanup
condition.  When it finds the desired stack frame, it passes control
to the procedure associated with that frame at the location indicated
by the label variable argument.  If the desired stack frame cannot be
found or if other obscure error conditions arise (e.g., the stack is
not threaded correctly), the unwinder_ subroutine signals the
unwinder_error condition.  If the target is not on the current stack,
and there is a stack in a higher ring, that stack is searched after
the current one is unwound.
