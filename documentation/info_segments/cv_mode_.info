Function:   converts a character string containing access
modes for segments into a bit string used by the ACL entries.


Syntax:
declare cv_mode_ entry(char(*), bit(*), fixed bin(35));
call cv_mode_ (char_modes, bit_modes, code);


Arguments:
char_modes
   are the character string access modes.  (Input)
bit_modes
   are the bit string access modes.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output) It can be:
   error_table_$bad_acl_mode
      if char_mode contains an invalid segment access mode character.

If char_modes is "null" or "n", bit_modes is set to "0"b.  The mode
characters in char_modes may occur in any order.  Spaces are ignored.
The following table indicates what bit in bit_modes is turned on when
the access mode character is found.

     Access Mode     Bit in bit_modes
     -----------     ----------------
          r                  1
          e                  2
