06/11/76  Attaching and Detaching Logical Volumes

Before a process can access a segment stored on a private logical volume, the
logical volume must be attached (Type "help attach_lv"). Each process wishing to
access the segment must individually attach the logical volume.
An attempt by a process to use a segment on a private logical volume that is
not attached results in an error message.
  The user must have rw access to the Access Control Segment (ACS) of the
volume in order to attach it. The ACS is maintained by the volume's owner.
  A logical volume remains attached until the process explicitly detaches it
(type "help detach_lv").
