:Info: info_seg_verify_:  2020-11-26  info_seg_verify_

The verify_info command uses the info_seg_verify_ subroutine to parse
and verify info segments, and display rules and guidelines for info
segment which are maintained in the info_seg_specifications_ data
structures.


:Entry: iFiles:  2020-11-25  info_seg_verify_$iFiles

Function: initiates and verifies contents of each info segment
described by an input iFile structure (in the verify_info_data.files
threaded list), reporting failures to meet info segment organization
and formatting guidelines.

If verify_info_data.totalsS is "1"b, three elements are set in
verify_info_data to report that issues were found:

  .segs_processed    count of info segments examined.
  .error_count       count of errors or issues found.
  .highest_severity  severity of the most serious error or issue found.


If verify_info_data.totalsS is "0"b, those elements are set, but error
or warning messages are displayed for each error or issue found in a
particular info segment.  Also, info segment block and section
organization is reported to the user as each info segment is verified.


Syntax:
   declare info_seg_verify_$iFiles entry (ptr);
   call info_seg_verify_$iFiles (verify_info_dataP);


Arguments:
verify_info_dataP
   points to the verify_info_data structure (see
   verify_info_data.incl.pl1).


:Entry: display_specifications:  2020-11-26  info_seg_verify_$display_specifications

Function: displays guidelines for:
 - supported info segment file structures (ordering of info blocks).
 - rules for determining kind of each block.
 - preferred section titles, with recommendations for mapping
   deprecated (obsolete) titles to a preferred title.
 - recommended section titles used in each kind of block.


Syntax:
   declare info_seg_verify_$display_specifications entry (ptr);
   call info_seg_verify_$display_specifications (verify_info_dataP);


Arguments:
verify_info_dataP
   points to the info_seg_data structure.  Refer to
   verify_info_data.incl.pl1.


List of selectors:
   The verify_info_data.rules_area element selects the info seg
   guidelines to display.  This element may have one of the following
   constants (also declared in verify_info_data.incl.pl1).
VI_RULE_all_areas
  displays all rules and guidelines used by verify_info.
VI_RULE_file_structure
  displays guidelines for supported file structures (allowed order of
  :Info: :[Info]: :Entry: and :hcom: block divider lines within an
  info segment).
VI_RULE_block_kind
  displays rules used to determine the kind of each info block
  (e.g., command or active function, subroutine, subsystem request,
  etc.).


VI_RULE_section_titles
  displays Multics standard info segment section titles, and a list of
  obsolete or deprecated titles with a preferred replacement.
VI_RULE_all_kinds
  displays section titles typical for each kind of info block,
  including the usual order of appearance within the block of each
  title.  Use a selector below to display section titles for
  particular kinds of info blocks.


VI_RULE_command_titles
  displays section titles typical for an info block describing a
  command or active function.
VI_RULE_gi_titles
  displays section titles typical for a generic info block (.gi.info
  segment).


VI_RULE_subsystem_titles
  displays section titles typical for an info block describing a
  subsystem request or active request; a subsystem request summary; or
  other subsystem topic.
VI_RULE_request_titles
  displays section titles typical for an info block describing a
  subsystem request or active request.
VI_RULE_topic_titles
  displays section titles typical for an info block describing a
  subsystem request summary; or other subsystem topic.


VI_RULE_subroutine_titles
  displays section titles typical for an info block describing a
  subroutine or function.  This includes a subroutine introduction
  block, and blocks describing each subroutine entry point.
VI_RULE_io_titles
  displays section titles typical for an info block describing an
  I/O module; or one of its setup operations (open_file, close_file,
