The autobaud feature of the Multics Communication System (MCS) is
designed to recognize/configure the baud rate (bits per second) of an
asynchronous hsla channel at dialup time.  The autobaud facility
selects a 1200 baud rate immediately if a lead from the answer modem is
on; otherwise it selects a rate of 300, 1200, 2400, 4800 or 9600 baud
based on the sampling of bit changes for the incoming characters, "l",
"L" or a carriage return ("CR").


Lead control selection of 1200 baud:
If the answer modem turns "on" pin 12 of the cable connected from it to
the FNP, the channel is set to 1200 baud and the channel is then
handled in the normal manner.  The answering modem can be set to
respond to a switch on the originate modem which indicates that the
terminal is operating at 1200 baud.  The operation of the channel will
not appear any different to the user than if he had dialed into a
strictly 1200 baud channel (there is no requirement for the user to
type any characters before he will receive the login banner).


Bit sampling selects other bauds:
If the signal on pin 12 is "off", sampling for the bit changes of an
input character is performed.  To accomplish this, the following
sequence will occur:


    1. The user establishes a connection with the host.
    2. The user types in either the letter "l", "L" or "CR".
    3. The software in the FNP scans the incoming bit stream looking
       for bit changes at 4800 baud.  Since the "l", "L" or "CR"
       character is known, the changes in state of the bits ("0" or
       "1") will indicate the timing necessary to transmit the bits,
       and therefore the baud rate of the channel is determined.
    4. From here the channel is handled in the normal manner.  The
       answerback is processed if required, initial string sent if any
       and the login banner is displayed.
    5. The user types in any of the preaccess commands (MAP, etc.)  if
       desired.
    6. The user logs into the system using "l" again for "login",
       enter, etc.


Hardware:
Any asynchronous hsla channel may be configured with the autobaud
feature.  Modems may or may not be used.  There are communication
switchers which can be used to connect a user terminal to any of a
number of host connections configured at various baud rates.  The
hardware connected to the FNP channel must operate at the desired rate
and allow the user to go through the above dialog.


Modems:
The answer modem must be able to sense the baud rate of the originate
modem and operate at the desired baud rate with the FNP channel.

Some modems operate at a fixed baud rate with the FNP but accept calls
from originating modems operating at various baud rates.  In this case,
the autobaud feature would not be used.  A modem of the is type is the
Courier HST, made by USRobots.

There are several modems which can be used on channels configured with
the autobaud feature which make use of the pin 12 lead change.  Vadic
(3467) and Western Electric (212A) are two manufacturers that make such
modems.  Special circuits are required to handle the data over
voice-grade dialup lines.  It is because of these special circuits that
a modem of one manufacturer will not necessarily be able to interface
to a modem of another manufacturer.


Modem options needed for autobaud:
Special modem options may be required.  Some modems can be configured
to indicate the position of the high speed switch on the originate
modem.  This indication is signalled by pin 12 of the RS232 interface.
a. In the Western Electric 212A modem, this feature is enabled in the
   answer modem when the "YQ" option is installed.
b. It is currently unknown how other modem manufactures treat this
   feature.


Algorithm:
The following is the algorithm used to determine the baud rates for
various terminals.  This discussion is directed towards people
knowledgable in communications who wish to understand the design of the
autobaud facility.


Notes:
1. A communications line can be in one of two states, 1 (also called
   "mark" condition) and 0 (also called "space" condition).
2. The line is normally held in a 1 state.
3. The first incoming bit is always a start bit, which (being a 0 bit
   by definition) changes the line state to 0 and causes the hardware
   to begin sampling bits.
4. The bits of a character are transmitted after the start bit starting
   with the least significant bit and ending with the parity bit after
   the most significant bit, followed by a stop bit.


5. A stop bit is a 1 state held on the line for one bit time interval.
6. The channel is set up to receive 7 data bits plus 1 parity bit (8
   information bits) with one start and stop bit (a total of 10 bits).
   The parity bit in the sampling is stripped off before the
   comparison.
7. Bits in the sampling dependent on the parity bit of the incoming
   character are masked off (shown as X in sampling lines below).


In the following diagrams, all sampling is done at 4800 baud, using the
"l", "L" and "CR" characters.  In the incoming lines below, the time
between the vertical bars is the bit time for the indicated baud rate
in relation to the 4800 baud rate shown in the sampling lines.


Legend:
  B - start bit (begin)
  P - parity bit
  E - stop bit (end)
  X - bit in the 4800 baud sample whose value is uncertain because it
      depends on the parity bit of incoming character


Terminal operating at 300 baud:
All characters are detected as line breaks since the channel is
operating at 4800 baud.  There are about two 4800 baud characters in
the same time as one bit time of a 300 baud character.  The FNP
hardware will sense only 300 baud bits that are "0" and they are long
enough to be sensed as "break" or "quit" signals.
