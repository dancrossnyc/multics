Description

138  
If you read mail in another person's mailbox and try to reply to that
mail, and if the reply-to person was not the sender of the mail, the
name of the recipient of the mail (the person whose mailbox you're
reading) will be placed in the cc:  field automatically.

emacs_rmail has the same problem.  This is caused by calling
mlsys_utils_ $create_reply_message with the
reply_option.flag.include_recipients set to true.  If this is not set
to true, no-one in the cc field will be included in the reply.

When a user supplies a search string for selecting messages, the entire
message is searched including portions that are not displayed on the
screen.  Only those portions which are displayed should be searched so
as to avoid confusion.

This problem occurs because xmail uses mlsys_utils_$search_message to
perform the search.  This program will search whatever portion of the
message the caller requests (envelope, header, redistribution_list,
body), but xmail's version of a header is drawn from portions of
several of these structures which must be searched in their entirety to
cover the visible-to-xmail fields.  Therefore, non-visible fields are
matched.  The alternative is to not use this facility, but to write a
whole separate parser to examine what xmail knows about.

One possible alternative to scrapping the mlsys_util program might be
to provide a means for xmail to display the entire header so that users
could determine why messages were selected.

Xmail creates a segment name for a deferred reply by changing the first
70 bits of the message_id into a unique character string.  This has
lead to problems when dealing with foreign mail, as the mechanism to
generate message IDs will only guarantee a unique ID with local mail
and within a process for foreign mail.  In a small amount of cases,
xmail will try to use a deferred reply for a different message.  A
possible solution is to generate the segment name by changing the bits
of the date_time_created field into a unique character string.

It is possible to be placed into the lisp environment during xmail if
the break key is hit at exactly the right time when the editor is first
setting up.  The window of time is extremely small and the problem is
difficult to reproduce.  It is caused by the small window between lisp
and emacs initialization where the emacs quit handler is invoked but
not all things are initialized.  This is a system limitation for xmail
at this time.

Xmail does not consider the case where the user may not be at the same
authorization as the access class of the .mlsys dir.

Executive_mail cannot run while the audit system is on.  This should be
documented as a limitation.

29  phx12778
An error message, "Fatal error ...  Error while processing in lower
ring ..." pops up at odd (rare) times.  The last time it happened, the
user had deleted all of his incoming mail and was trying to exit via
F4.  This error always happens when the user is trying to exit.

Error logging should keep track of more useful information.
