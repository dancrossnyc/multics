02/13/84  create_mail_table

Syntax:  create_mail_table


Function:  allows system administrators to create the initial mail
table.  The mail table is initially populated with information taken
from the person name table (PNT).


Notes:  The user must have e access to the gate mail_table_priv_, r
access to the PNT, and sma access to >site>mail_system in ring-2.  In
addition, the access class of the mail table will be the current
authorization of the creator, so this user should be logged in at
system_low (this may be ignored if the site does not use multiple AIM
levels); the command will attempt to set dir and seg privileges, in
which case the mail table will be created at system low, regardless of
the authorization of the creator.

Generally, this command should only be needed once, the first time the
system is booted when it is delivered, or when the site first upgrades
to MR10.2.  It must be used after the PNT has been created, but before
the system is brought up for regular service; the safest way is to run
it before the Answering Service is started.
