04/29/82  print_request_types, prt

Syntax:  prt {rqt_names} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
        [prt {rqt_names} {-control_args}]


Function: prints information about request types handled by I/O
Daemons.  When invoked as an active function, prt returns the names of
the selected request types which would have been printed.


Arguments:
rqt_names
   are the names of request types to be printed.  The star convention
   is allowed.


Control arguments: 
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of a heading line.
-user_defined, -udf
   prints information about request types for which user-defined output
   control argument settings have been defined using the eor command.
   The printed output includes both the user-defined request type name
   and its target request type name.  When used as an active function,
   only the user-defined request type name is returned.
-access_name User_id, -an User_id
   prints information about request types serviced by the I/O driver
   process identified by User_id.  See Notes below.


-print, -pr
   prints information about request types associated with the printer
   generic type.
-punch, -pch
   prints information about request types associated with the punch
   generic type.
-plot
   prints information about request types associated with the plotter
   generic type.
-generic_type XX, -gt XX
   lists request types of generic type XX.  This can be used to support
   site-defined generic types.


-directory PATH, -dr PATH
   specifies the pathname of a test directory to be used in place of
   the IO Daemon Directory (>ddd>idd).  prt looks for an
   iod_working_tables segment in this directory.


Notes: The User_id argument specified after -access_name may have any
of the following forms:

    Person_id.Project_id   matches that user only
    Person_id.*	       matches that person on any project
    Person_id	       same as Person_id.*
    *.Project_id	       matches any user on that project
    .Project_id	       same as *.Project_id


The enter_output_request command allows the user to define named groups
of default control argument settings.  The names of these groups can be
referenced as if they were user-defined request types.  These names are
shown in the output of the prt command, indented under the request type
to which they apply.  Also, the prt active function returns the names
of any user-defined request types which match the selection criteria.
Refer to enter_output_request.info for further discussion of default
control argument settings, and creation of user-defined request type
names via eor -default_name.
