03/31/83  tape_ansi_


Function: The tape_ansi_ I/O module implements the processing of
magnetic tape files according to the "American National Standards
Institute's ANSI X3.27-1978", "Magnetic Tape Labels and File Structure
for Information Interchange".  This document is referred to below as
"the Standard".  In addition, the I/O module provides a number of
features that are extensions to, but outside of, the Standard.  Using
these features may produce a nonstandard file, unsuitable for
interchange purposes.

Entries in the module are not called directly by users; rather, the
module is accessed through the I/O system.  See the Programmer's
Reference Manual for a general description of the I/O system.
