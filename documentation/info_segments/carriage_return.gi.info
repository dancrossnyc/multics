:Info: carriage_return.gi: 02/04/82 carriage return

     A "carriage return" means that the typing mechanism moves to the
first column of the next line.  On the Multics system, this action
is the result of the ASCII line-feed character.  The terminal type
determines which keys the user presses to perform the equivalent
action (e.g., RETURN, LINE SPACE, or NL).


:Info: character.gi: 02/04/82 character

     A hardware-related unit of information that on the Multics system
is 9 bits or 6 bits.  The Multics system native-mode character set is
9-bit ASCII, although the hardware does support additional character
sets.


:Info: closed_subsystem.gi: 02/04/82 closed subsystem

     A separate environment that bears no resemblance to and has no
knowledge of the Multics system itself.


:Info: command.gi: 02/04/82 command

     A program designed to be called by typing its name at a terminal.
Most commands are system-maintained, but any user program that takes
only character-string input arguments and no output arguments can be
used as a command.


:Info: command_level.gi: 02/04/82 command level

     The process state in which lines input from a user's terminal
are interpreted by the system as a command (i.e., the line is sent to
the command processor).  A user is at command level at login when a
command completes or encounters an error, or is stopped by issuing the
quit signal.  Command level is normally indicated by a ready message.


:Info: command_line.gi: 03/05/82 command line

     The line on which command instructions are given to Multics; it
includes a command name, arguments to that command, if any, and a
newline.


:Info: command_processor.gi: 02/04/82 command processor

The program that interprets the lines input at command level and calls
the appropriate programs, after processing parentheses and active
functions.


:Info: control_argument.gi: 02/04/82 control argument

     An argument to a command that specifies the command's execution
in some way.  System control arguments begin with a hyphen, such as
-all, -long, or -hold.  The meaning of each control argument accepted
by a specific command is given as part of the description of the
command.  Many control arguments have standard abbreviations such as
-lg for -long.  See control_arguments.gi.info for a list of commonly
used control arguments and their short names.


:Info: crash.gi: 02/04/82 crash

     There are two types of crash:  FNP crash and system.

     An FNP crash is an unplanned termination of service from the
front-end network processor causing a disconnection of the process.
The process can be saved and reconnected with the -save_on_disconnect
control argument to the login command, or the save_on_disconnect
command.  See also process_preservation.gi.info.

     A system crash is an unplanned termination of system availability
caused by problems in hardware and/or software, often signalled by the
message: MULTICS NOT IN OPERATION.  Processes cannot be reconnected
after a system crash.  See damaged_segments.gi.info.


:Info: cursor.gi: 03/05/82 cursor

     The blinking square or underscore that marks your current
position on a video terminal.
