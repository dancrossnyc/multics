Function: changes the origin or size of the specified window.  You
must give at least one of -column, -height, -line, or -width.  If you
give only -line (changing the top line of the window), the window

of the top line number (moving the window down), the window length
shrinks accordingly; however if -line decreases the top line number
(moving the window up), the length remains the same.  If you supply
only -height (changing the window length), the origin line remains the
same.  If you select only -width (changing the window width), the
origin column remains the same.
