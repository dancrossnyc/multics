:Entry:  get:  09/01/83  search_paths_$get

Function: This entry point returns the search paths in a search
list.


Syntax:
declare search_paths_$get entry (char (*), bit (36), char (*), pointer,
     pointer, fixed binary, pointer, fixed binary (35));
call search_paths_$get (sl_name, sl_control, ref_path, search_seg_ptr,
     sl_info_area_ptr, sl_info_version, sl_info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
sl_name
   is the search list name.  (Input)
sl_control
   is an expansion control mask.  See the sl_control_s structure in
   "Notes" below.  (Input)
ref_path
   is the directory name used for the "-referencing_dir" search path.
   If ref_path is null, then the "-referencing_dir" search path is
   skipped.  (Input)
search_seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the search segment.  If this pointer is null, then
   the process search segment is used.  (Input)
sl_info_area_ptr
   is a pointer to an area in which sl_info can be allocated.  (Input)


sl_info_version
   is the version of the sl_info structure required.  (Input)
sl_info_ptr
   is a pointer to the sl_info structure containing the search paths in
   the search list.  (See "Notes" below).  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  It may be the following:
   error_table_$no_search_list the search list was not in the search
   segment.  (Output)


Notes:
The sl_control argument is defined by the sl_control_s structure
contained in sl_control_s.incl.pl1.  Expanding the "-referencing_dir"
keyword substitutes the ref_path argument for the keyword.

The sl_info structure is contained in sl_info.incl.pl1.


Arguments:
version
   is the version of the sl_info structure.
num_paths
   is the number of search paths in this structure.
change_index_p
   is a pointer to the search lists' update count.  The update count is
   a fixed binary (71) integer, and is incremented each time the search
   list is modified.  The caller can determine if the search list has
   been modified by comparing change_index in this structure with the
   value pointed to by change_index_p.


change_index
   is the current value of the search lists' update count.
type
   specifies the type of the search path.  Keywords in sl_info.incl.pl1
   define the possible values.
code
   is a standard status code for this search path.
pathname
   is the search path.
