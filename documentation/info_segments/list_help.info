:Info: list_help: lh:  2020-10-23  list_help, lh

Syntax as a command:  lh TOPICs {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [lh TOPICs {-control_args}]


Function: displays the names of all info segments (info segs) having
one of the TOPIC strings appear in their entryname.  The entrynames of
an info segment indicate the topics covered by that info seg.


Arguments:
TOPICs
   are strings to be searched for in info seg names.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints or returns full pathnames of info segs, rather than
   entrynames.
-all, -a
   displays the names of all info segs.  (Default: to display the
   names of only those info segs whose names match the topics
   specified)
-brief, -bf
   does not display the alternate names of the info segs.  You can't
   use -brief in the active function.  (Default: display all names on
   matching info segments.)
-no_sort
   does not sort the output.  (Default)


-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies the pathname of a directory to search for applicable
   segments.  Multiple -pathname control arguments are allowed.  (See
   "Notes.")  (Default: to search the directories in the info_segments
   search list)
-sort
   sorts the output in ascending alphabetic order using as key the
   primary name of the info segs.  If you give -absolute_pathname,
   -sort uses the entryname part of it as primary name.


Notes: An info seg is considered to pertain to a given topic if the
topic name appears in (i.e., is a substring of) the info seg name.  The
active function returns the selected names separated by spaces.  For
information on info segs, see the help command.

The default info seg directories contain info segs provided by the site
and those supplied with the system.  Type "print_search_paths
info_segments" to see what the current info segs search list is.  For
information about search lists, see the search facility
commands--add_search_paths, in particular.
