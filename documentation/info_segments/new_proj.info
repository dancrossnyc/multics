02/08/84  new_proj

Syntax:  new_proj Project_id


Function: allows the accounting administrator to retrieve all project
registration data, including the initial list of users, and install
the new PDT and SAT.

The new_proj command exits immediately and stops whatever it is doing
when the accounting administrator types "stop" in response to any
question.  At the end of input, the accounting administrator is asked
if he wants to review the data; if he replies "yes", all of the
project registration data are printed out.  The new_proj command
assumes default values for the project's attributes, grace, and load
control group.  These items can be changed when the input is reviewed
or later by using the edit_proj command.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project to be registered.  The Project_id
   must be from one to nine characters long, must begin with a capital
   letter or a digit, and must be unique at the site.


Notes:  If the system crashes during the new_proj command, the project
may have been incompletely added to the system.  If this happens, the
accounting administrator MUST NOT try to add the project again from the
beginning.  The help of a system administrator is necessary to complete
the adding of the project.  All terminal output should be saved and no
other project registrations attempted until a system administrator has
checked and corrected the files.
