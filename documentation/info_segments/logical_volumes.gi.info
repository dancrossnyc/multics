06/04/76  Logical Volumes

A logical volume is one or more disk volumes that contain segments.
Storage is allocated on logical volumes according to the following rules--
  1. segments immediately inferior to a directory reside on the same logical
volume;
  2. the logical volume on which inferior segments of a directory reside is set
when the directory is created;
  3. the logical volume of a new directory is the same as its parent unless a
master dir is created (type "help create_dir" and "help master_directories").


Segments are available when the logical volume on which they reside is
mounted. The root logical volume, containing all directories in the storage
hierarchy, is always mounted. Other logical volumes are mounted and demounted
by the operator at user's request (Type "help lv_attaching").


Registration record of logical volume contains:
  1. list of disk volumes comprising it.
  2. owner ID
  3. public or private switch.
  4. list of users with quota accounts.
  5. list of master directories.
