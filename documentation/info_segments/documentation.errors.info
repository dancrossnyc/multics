Description

83  phx17811
The online documentation for set_proc_required should refer to the
phcs_ gate, not the phhcs_ one.  This problem will be fixed by the
person in charge of command info segs (Jerry Garcia) as time permits.

80  phx16446
Zeroed out window_position_info in order to be sure that stack garbage
does not interfere with invocation of tut_main_menu_.

79  phx17233
Added a check for error_table_$recoverable_error after invocation of
format_document in tut_get_seg_ and a condition handler for sub_err_.

77  phx17233
Changed invocation of format_document_$switch in tut_get_seg_ to check
for recoverable error.

58  phx14674
In CY74 (Forum manual), p.  A-2, first paragraph under "Gate Access",
change:

"The Forum subsystem has three gates:"

to:  "The Forum subsystem has three gates (located in >unbundled):"

54  
More typos to be fixed in next revision:

On p.7-7, the last line in the second to the last paragraph, change
"Order No.  CG40" to "Order No.  CH27".

On p.10-1, second sentence, change "Section 10" to "Section 11".

On.  p.10-2, in the second example (box), sixth line of text, change
"<CR)" to "<CR>".

On p.i-4, under the "S" heading, change "Subroutine Descriptions" to
"subroutine descriptions".

52  
Typos (to be corrected in next revision):

On p.5-2, second paragraph from the top, change "while attending a
meeting Note" to "while attending a meeting.  Note".

On p.7-7, last paragraph, change "created to hold you transaction" to
"created to hold your transaction".

Multics Technical Bulletin 335 describes a procedure for documenting
error messages produced by the system.  This information will be
officially documented in the next update of AN82 (Multics Standards
SDN).

A detailed description of this procedure will be in AN82, a brief
description of this procedure is as follows:

Comments are inserted into the source of all programs which produce
system messages; these comments are sections of the error mesasge
documentation.  An automatic procedure collects and sorts these
messages, and produces a runoff file which lists all messages.

AN87 (Hardware/Software) formats needs a picture on Page 6-7 presenting
the extended address format ICW used in the DN6670 style FNP.  This
information will be inlcuded in the next update of the manual.

The documentation will look like the following:

Just before the Paragraph titled, "PERIPHERAL STATUS/CONTROL WORD
FORMATS" the following will be added:

The following format of the ICW is used in DN6670 FNPs.  The hardware
will use this format if it finds bit 18 on.  This format allows the IOM
in the FNP to directly address all the memory that could be configured
on the FNP without using the paging mechanism.

AN85 (The Multics Communications System) needs a paragraph added in
Section 17 about how to modify FNP macros.  This information has
already been documented in CC75 for MR 10.0 on Page 6-3.  The
documentation is as follows:

     A GCOS job named macros_asm is used to produce the 355_macros
library.  If it is necessary to generate a new macro library, this job
should be run in a working directory that contains the macros.map355
source, using a command of the form:

     gcos >ldd>mcs>info>macros_asm -truncate {other -control_args}

where other -control_args may include, for example, -list and
-lower_case to produce an ASCII list segment.  (Refer to AN05 the
Multics GCOS ENvironment Simulator Manual for more info).

**This info will be put in AN85 the next time the manual is updated***

The changes in the tp info file for MR 7.0 have never been documented
in CC96 (I believe the manual has Not been updated since MR 7.0).  The
documentation should be updated the next time the book is updated
08/27/79 This info segment describes how the MR7.0b release of Multics
TP differs from the Transaction Processing manual, Order no.  CC96-01.
The recommended documentation changes are as follows:

Page ii, Preface:  ADD at the end:

                        Implementation Restriction

     The implementation of the -use_xcn_mode control argument of
tp_start is not complete.  This control argument should not be used.
All claims about and references to commiting transactions, rolling back
transactions, having database changes appear atomically and rolling
back database changes after a crash should be ignored.  In particular,
the transaction_call_ interfaces described in section 4 and the
-transaction attach description control argument of vfile_ described in
MPM Subroutines are not completely implemented.


Page 1-1, List of Features:  ADD "if the -use_xcn_mode control argument
of tp_start was specified" to the first two items.


Page 1-2, second paragraph:  ADD to the end:  "This applies only if the
-use_xcn_mode control argument of tp_start was specified."


Page 1-3, Figure 1-1:  REPLACE "Monitor" by "Subsystem".


Page 1-4, third paragraph:  REPLACE the beginning of the third sentence
from "Databases" to "If the -use_xcn_mode control argument of tp_start
was specified, databases".  INSERT "be" after "changes to" in the
fourth line.


Page 2-4, Step 10:  REPLACE the first exec_com, the second paragraph
and the second exec_com by:

 & Prepare MRDS databases
 application_open_mrds_db db_id1 dsm_path1
 application_ready_mrds_file db_id1 file_name1 rdy_mode1
collection_delay_time1
 .
 .
 .
 application_ready_mrds_file db_id1 file_nameI rdy_modeI
collection_delay_timeI
 .
 .
 .
 application_open_mrds_db db_idN dsm_pathN
 .
 .
 .
 &quit

The application_open_mrds_db and application_ready_mrds_file commands
are written by the TP Administrator.  See Section 6 for more
information about writing these commands.  The following is
tp_init_database.ec for the Sample_TP project:

 & Prepare MRDS databases
 sample_tp_open_mrds_db people <databaes>people_db
 sample_tp_ready_mrds_file people people monitor_retrieve 90
 sample_tp_open_mrds_db inventory <databases>inventory
 sample_tp_ready_mrds_file inventory inventory update 300
 sample_tp_ready_mrds_file inventory parts update 300
 &quit


Page 2-5, Step 11:  DELETE "All segments in the comands directory are
explicitly initiated to reduce overhead." REPLACE the example worker
process absentee control segment by the following:

 change_wdir &1
 tp_worker_init_tcf [wd]
 &
 & Attach and open I/O switches
 io_call attach parts vfile_ <databases>parts -stationary -transaction
tcf_
          -share
 io_call open parts keyed_sequential_update
 io_call control parts set_wait_time -collection_delay_time 300
 &
 tp_worker_start &ec_name [wd]
 &quit

ADD to the end of the last paragraph:  "The commitment mechanism is
used only if the -use_xcn_mode control argument of tp_start was
specified.  If this control argument was not specified, omit
"-transaction tcf_" from the attach description."


Page 3-4, tp_cancel:  ADD to the paragraph description:  "This command
may only be used while transaction processing is running."


Page 3-5, tp_change_deadline:  ADD to the paragraph description:  "This
command may only be used while transaction processing is running."


Page 3-6, tp_display_current_xcns:  REPLACE "TP command name and
TP_user_id" by "TP_user_id and TP command name".  ADD to the paragraph
description:  "This command may only be used while transaction
processing is running."


Page 3-7, tp_get_xcn_status:  REPLACE the paragraph description by:

     The tp_get_xcn_status command prints information about
transactions.  If the transaction has not been processed the following
information is printed:  transaction number, state, TP user who
submitted it, TP command name, if it is test mode, I/O process it was
submitted from, submission time and deadline.  If the transaction is
running, the following information is also printed:  worker process,
time started and time from submission to processing.  If the
transaction has finished running, the following information is also
printed:  time finished, start to finish time, submit to finish time
and if nonzero the vcpu time, page faults and retries.  If the
transaction was canceled, the information for an unprocessed
transaction is printed along with the cancelation time as the finish
time and the time from submission to cancelation.  This command may
only be used while transaction processing is running.

REPLACE the description for control_arg by "may be -brief or -bf to
print only the transaction number and its state."


Page 3-8, tp_list_pending_requests:  ADD to the paragraph description:
"This command may only be used while transaction processing is
running." REPLACE the description of the -long control argument by:
"prints the transaction number, position in the queue, deadline, TP
user who submitted it and submission time for each pending transaction.
The default prints only the position in the queue and transaction
number."


Page 3-9, tp_start:  ADD to the control arguments section:

-use_xcn_mode specifies that vfile_'s transaction mode should be used
in this TP subsystem.  This allows database changes in a transaction to
appear atomically and allows transactions to be rolled back.

-no_use_xcn_mode specifies that vfile_'s transaction mode should not be
used in this TP subysystem.  This is the default.

ADD to the "Notes" section:

     The -new_master control argument is incompatible with the
-use_xcn_mode and the -no_use_xcn_mode control arguments.  If the
-no_use_xcn_mode control argument is specified and Multics crashes in
the middle of a transaction or before the transaction is marked as
completed, the transacton is rerun.  Database changes made by the
transaction before the crash are not rolled back.  If an application
only reads databases, or an application is not written to depend upon
transaction mode, then it is more efficient to specify
-no_use_xcn_mode.  Also, test mode is not available if -no_use_xcn_mode
is specified.


Page 3-11, tp_who:  ADD to the paragraph description:  "This command
may only be used while transaction processing is running." ADD to the
description of the TP_user_id argument:  "The default prints
information about all TP users that are signed on." REPLACE the
description of the -long control argument by:  "prints the I/O process
name, device channel name, baud rate, terminal type, terminal id and
TP_user_id.  The default prints the TP_user_id and I/O process name."
ADD to the description of the -io_process control argument:  "More than
one -io_process control argument may be specified."


Page 3-13, tp_rollback_transaction_:  ADD the following as a "Notes"
section:

     Database changes are rolled back only if the -use_xcn_mode control
argument of tp_start was specified.


Page 3-14, tp_verify_transaction_:  ADD the following as a "Notes"
section:

     If the -no_use_xcn_mode control argument of tp_start was
specified, the code argument will always be zero since asynchronous
changes only occur in transaction mode.


Page 3-20, tp_io_enter_test_mode:  ADD the following as a "Notes"
section:

     Test mode transactions may be run only if the -use_xcn_mode
control argument of tp_start was specified.


Page 3-22, tp_io_get_xcn_status:  REPLACE the paragraph description by:

     The tp_io_get_xcn_status command prints information about
transactions submitted by the TP user.  If the transaction has not been
processed the following information is printed:  transaction number,
state, TP command name, if it is test mode, submission time and
deadline.  If the transaction is running, the following information is
also printed:  time started and time from submission to processing.  If
the transaction has finished running, the following information is also
printed:  time finished, start to finish time, submit to finish time
and if nonzero the vcpu time, page faults and retries.  If the
transaction was canceled, the information for an unprocessed
transaction is printed along with the cancelation time as the finish
time, and the time from submission to cancelation.

REPLACE the description for control_arg by "may be -brief or -bf to
print only the transaction number and its state."


Page 3-23, tp_io_list_pending_requests:  In the paragraph description,
REPLACE "user" by "TP user".  REPLACE the description of the -long
control argument by:  "prints the transaction number, position in the
queue, deadline and submission time for each pending transaction.  The
default prints only the position in the queue and transaction number."


Page 3-35, tp_meters:  REPLACE the seven metering information points in
the paragraph description by:

xo number of unprocessed, successful, commitment failure and error
     transactions.  Cancelations are included in the error total.

xo number of transactions submitted and submissions per minute, broken
down
     by I/O process and by TP user.

xo for processed transactions, the number, number per minute, average
     submisission to start time, average start to finish time, average
vcpu
     time, average page faults and average retries, broken down by
worker
     process and by TP command.

 REPLACE the usage line by:

          tp_meters {path} {-control_args}

ADD to the description of the path argument:  "The default is tp.tpinq
in the working directory."


Page 3-38, tp_shrink_q:  REPLACE the usage line by:

          tp_shrink_q {path} {-control_args}

ADD to the description of the path argument:  "The default is tp.tpinq
in the working directory.  ADD to the first paragraph in the "Notes"
section:  "One of the -delete or -output_description control arguments
must be specified."


Page 5-1:  ADD to the end of the first paragraph:  "If the -no_use_xcn_
