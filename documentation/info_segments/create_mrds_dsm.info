08/13/84  create_mrds_dsm, cmdsm

Syntax as a command:  cmdsm source_path db_path {-control_args}


Function:  This command creates a MRDS data base submodel from a data
submodel source segment.  The path of the resulting data submodel can
be specified as an argument to the dsl_$open subroutine or the
mrds_call open or LINUS open commands instead of the path to a data
base directory.  This command is intended for use by data base
administrators (DBAs) when defining a view of a data base for a given
application.  The submodel created only works against the data base
whose path was in the command and not against similar data bases with
other pathnames.


Arguments:
source_path
   is the pathname of a data submodel source segment.  If source_path
   does not have a suffix of cmdsm, then one is assumed.  However, the
   cmdsm suffix must be the last component of the name of the source
   segment.
db_path
   is the pathname of the data base with which the resulting data
   submodel is to be associated.  This data base must exist.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   overwrites an existing submodel with the same name without querying
   the caller to be sure that the old submodel can be destroyed.
-install, -ins
   creates the submodel in the secure.submodels directory that is under
   the data base directory rather than in the working_dir.  The use of
   this control argument causes a directory named secure.submodels to
   be created under the data base directory if it does not already
   exist.  This control argument is restricted to DBAs.
-list, -ls
   creates a segment containing a listing of the submodel source,
   followed by information about the submodel to model mapping, in the
   working directory.  The segment also contains a list of any errors
   found while creating the submodel.


-no_force, -nfc
   if a submodel with the same name already exists, queries the user as
   to whether it can be overwritten.  This control argument undoes the
   effects of a -force.  (Default)
-no_install, -nins
   creates the submodel in the working_dir.  (Default)
-no_list, -nls
   specifies that a listing segment is not created.  (Default)


Notes:  The data submodel is a multisegment file with the same name as
the submodel source but with a dsm (rather than cmdsm) suffix.

Error messages are written to the error_output I/O switch as they
occur.  These messages are also included in the listing segment if one
is produced.

Only a DBA can run this command against a secure data base.  If the
data base is secure and the -install control argument is not used, the
submodel will be created in the DBA's working directory and a warning
that the submodel is not secure will be issued.
