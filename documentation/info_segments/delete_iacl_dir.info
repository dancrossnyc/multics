Syntax as a command:  did path {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function: deletes entries from a directory's initial access control
list (initial ACL) in a specified directory.  A directory initial ACL
contains the ACL entries to be placed on directories created in the
specified directory (see IACL.gi).


Arguments:
path
   specifies a pathname of the directory whose directory initial ACL
   should be changed.  If path is -working_directory (-wd) or omitted,
   your working directory is assumed.  The star convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   entries in the directory initial ACL that match the User_ids are
   deleted (for a description of the matching strategy, see the set_acl
   command).  If you give no User_ids, your Person_id and current
   Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes the entire directory initial ACL except an entry for
   *.SysDaemon.*.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the messages "User name not on ACL of path" and "Empty
   initial ACL."
-ring N, -rg N
   identifies the ring number whose directory initial ACL is to be
   deleted.  It can appear anywhere on the line and affects the whole
   line.  If present, follow it by N (where 0 <= N <= 7).  If not
   given, your ring is assumed.


Access required: You must have modify permission on the directory.
