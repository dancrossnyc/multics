Syntax:  lmd volume_names {-control_args}


Function:	 prints logical volume and master directory quotas.


Arguments:
volume_names
   are the names of the logical volumes.


Control arguments:
-account User_ids
   specifies a list of quota account names for which information is
   desired, where each User_id is of the form Person_id.Project_id.
   Asterisks (*) may not be used when specifying quota account names.
   Asterisks in account names only match quota account names that
   contain asterisks.
-all, -a
   prints information about all users of the logical volume.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses header and shortens the output lines.
-directory, -dr
   prints only master directory information.


-long, -lg
   prints additional information, including the quota account for each
   directory.
-owner User_ids
   specifies a list of directory owners for which information is
   desired, where each User_id is of the form Person_id.Project_id.
   (An asterisk (*) can be used when specifying either component of an
   owner name.)  If this control argument is omitted, information is
   printed only for directories owned by the user issuing the command.
-quota
   prints only quota information.


Notes:  If neither the -quota nor the -directory control argument is
specified, information about both quotas and directories is printed.
It is not necessary that the logical volume be mounted to use this
command.

The user must have "e" access to the logical volume to use the -owner,
-account, and -all control arguments.  If the -all control argument is
specified, the -owner and -account control arguments cannot be given.
If both the -owner and -account control arguments are specified,
information is printed only for directories that match both conditions.
