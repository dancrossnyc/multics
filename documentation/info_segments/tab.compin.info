Syntax:  .ifi tab "table-title"


Function:
This compose macro
1) increments the table counter
2) outputs a centered, perhaps multiline table heading above the table
   with appropriate spacing.
3) adds the 'table-title' to the list of Tables in the Table of
   Contents if the creation of such a list has been enabled (see
   tabl_on.info)


Arguments:
'table-title' is the title of the table, as it is to appear in the list
   of Tables in the Table of Contents (initial caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The table counter is maintained on a per-section basis for documents
   done in sections (those in which the 'section' variable has been
   set), and on a per-document basis for all other documents.
2) After the tab macro is used, the 'table' compose variable contains
   the table number of the current table.  'table' will be of the form
   '<section>-N' if the 'section' variable has been set.  'table' can
   be used in the text to refer to the current table.  (See
   tab_get_no.info for references to a table other than the current
   table.)
3) See tab_index.info, tab_on.info, and tab_get_no.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines generate a simple table following some text:

     These relationships are shown in the table below.
     .ifi tab "Relationships Table"
	NAME	     PLACE
	Paris	     France
	Rome	     Italy
	  .
	  .
	  .
