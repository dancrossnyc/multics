Syntax as a command:  response arg {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [response arg {-control_args}]


Function: asks you a question and returns the answer you typed.  The
answer is not returned in quotes; the command processor therefore
treats the answer as several strings if it contains spaces.  You can
use the command language ||[ feature if you want the command processor
to treat the returned string as a single argument.  (See also the query
active function.)


Arguments:
arg
   is the question to be asked.  If arg contains spaces or other
   command language characters, enclose it in quotes.


Control arguments:
-accept STRs
   where STRs are the only responses accepted from you.  If a STR
   contains spaces or other command language characters, enclose it in
   quotes.  If you respond to the question with an answer that is not
   one of the specified STRs, the active function prints a message
   explaining that your answer is unacceptable, lists the acceptable
   answers, and repeats the question.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses extra spacing and newlines when asking questions.
-disable_cp_escape, -dcpe
   disables the ability to escape to the command processor via the ".."
   response.  (See "Notes on command processor escape" below.)
-enable_cp_escape, -ecpe
   enables that ability.


-input_switch STR, -isw STR
   specifies the I/O switch to use for input of your response.
   (Default: user_input)
-long, -lg
   adds a leading newline and three trailing spaces to the question.
   (Default)
-no_trim
   do not trim trailing spaces from the question argument.
-non_null
   indicates that you must give a response.  If you reply with an empty
   (blank) line, the active function prints a message explaining that a
   null response is not allowed and repeats the question.


-output_switch STR, -osw STR
   specifies the I/O switch to use for output of the question to you.
   (Default: user_output)
-repeat DT, -rp DT
   repeats the question every DT if you have not responded (see Section
   1 for a description of valid DT values).
-trim
   trim trailing spaces from the question argument. (Default)


Notes: You can use the format_line active function to insert other
active function values into the question.


Notes on command processor escape: The -disable_cp_escape and
-enable_cp_escape control arguments override the system or subsystem
default.  The system default is "enabled."  Subsystems can define the
default to be either "enable" or "disable."  (See the command_query_
subroutine for details.)
