01/23/86 copy_names

Syntax as a command:  copy_names path1 {path2...path1N path2N}


Function: copies all names of one entry (directory, segment,
multisegment file, data management file, extended entry, or link) to
another.


Arguments:
path1
   pathname of entry whose names are to be copied.  The star convention
   is allowed.
path2
   pathname of entry to which all names are copied.  If you omit
   path2N, names are copied onto an entry in you working directory with
   the same entryname as path1N.  The equal convention is allowed.


Notes: All names are left on the original entry.  The two entries
cannot reside in the same directory because duplicate names are not
allowed in a directory.

Only one matching name per entry is used when resolving the equal name.
This is the first matching name on that entry (in the order returned by
hcs_$star_) for which the specified equal name exists.
