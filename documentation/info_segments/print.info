02/20/85  print, pr

Syntax as a command:  pr paths {-control_args}


Function: prints ASCII segments and multisegment files on user_output.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of the segments and multisegment files to be
   printed.  The star and archive component pathname conventions are
   accepted.


Control arguments:
-archive, -ac
   treats each archive component as a new file for heading and line
   numbering.  If any lines are printed from an archive component and
   if you supplied -header, prints a header identifying the archive
   component name and the date of modification of the archive
   component, in the format
      ARCHIVE::COMPONENT  date time
   where date and time are those stored in the archive.  This control
   argument is the default if archive components were named with the ::
   convention or if the entryname of the segment ends in .archive,
   unless you give -no_archive.
-chase
   includes links in the search if a starname is specified, and does
   not complain about missing link targets for starnames.


-exclude STRING, -ex STRING
   does not print lines containing STRING.  Exclusion is done after
   matching.  Thus, "-match A -exclude B" prints all lines with an A
   except those with a B.
-exclude /REGEXP/, -ex /REGEXP/
   does not print lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.  (See the qedx command for the definition of
   regular expressions.)
-for N
   prints N lines from the file, including the first line.  If you also
   use -to, printing stops when the first control argument is
   satisfied.  (Default: to print the whole file)
-from X, -fm X
   begins printing from the Xth line.  This control argument and -last
   are incompatible.  (Default: line 1)


-from /REGEXP/, -fm /REGEXP/
   begins with first line matching the regular expression REGEXP.
-from_page P
   starts printing with the Pth page, counting the first page as 1.
   (Default: to start with page 1)
-header, -he
   prints a header of the form
      NAME     date time
   before each segment.  If you choose -archive, the header is printed
   before each archive component instead of before each segment.  This
   control argument is the default if you give no other control
   argument or if you use the star convention or multiple pathnames.
-indent N, -ind N
   indents the printed output N columns.  (Default: no indentation)


-last N, -lt N
   print the last N lines from the file, or the last N lines of the
   region selected by -to.
-left_col N, -lc N
   does not print columns 1 to N-1.  It truncates on the left, printing
   each line of the file starting with column N.  If a line has fewer
   than N columns, a blank line is printed.  (Default: to print
   starting with column 1)
-line_length N, -ll N
   formats the page with a maximum physical line length of N
   characters.  Space generated by -indent and -number is not counted.
   If more than N characters are in an output line, the line is split
   and continued on the next line.  The default maximum line length is
   1024 characters although you can give larger values.


-match STRING
   prints only lines containing the character string STRING.
-match /REGEXP/
   prints only lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.
-name NAME, -nm NAME
   takes NAME literally, even if it is all numeric or begins with "-".
-no_archive, -nac
   does not print headings for individual archive components (even if
   the file being printed is an archive) and treats the file being
   printed as a single segment for line numbering and heading.
-no_chase
   does not include links when processing starnames.  (Default)


-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses the header before segments or archive components.  This
   is the default if you give only one pathname and other control
   arguments.
-no_vertsp
   simulates formfeed and vertical-tab characters by outputting newline
   characters.
-number, -nb
   prints line numbers before each line.  The line number and the
   spaces separating it from the line take up 10 spaces.
-output_switch SWITCH_NAME, -osw SWITCH_NAME
   directs the output to an attached and open (for stream output or
   stream input/output) I/O switch.  If not supplied, the output is
   directed to the user_output switch.


-page_length N, -pl N
   starts a new page by inserting a formfeed character after every N
   lines of the file are printed (see "Notes").  (Default: no
   pagination)
-phys_page_length N, -ppl N
   determines how many newline characters should be inserted between
   pages when you specify -no_vertsp.  N, whose default value is 66, is
   the number of lines on a whole page of paper.  (See "Notes.")
-right_col N, -rc N
   does not print columns past N.  Lines extending past column N are
   truncated on the right.  (Default: to print all columns)
-stop, -sp
   pauses before the first page and after each successive page until
   you type a newline.


-to N
   stops printing with line number N.  (Default: to print all lines)
-to /REGEXP/
   stops printing with the first line matching the regular expression
   REGEXP.  The search for REGEXP begins after the first line printed.
-to_page N
   stops printing after the Nth page.
-vertsp
   sends formfeed and vertical-tab characters to the terminal.
   (Default)
-wait, -wt
   pauses before the first page until you type a newline.


Notes: The -page_length control argument works with -phys_page_length
to eject the proper amount of spacing between pages.  For example:
   pr test_file -pl 40 -no_vertsp
prints 40 lines of the segment test_file and uses the default value for
-phys_page_length of 66 to emit 26 blank lines before the next 40 lines
are printed.  If you position the printer paper so that text begins
printing on the 13th line, then there are even amounts of leading and
trailing space on each page.

If you select any of -line_length, -page_length, -phys_page_length, or
-right_col or -left_col is > 1, printing is done via the printer
conversion software: overstrikes are replaced by multiple lines
separated by CR (015) characters, and other control characters are
ignored.


Numeric arguments are processed specially for compatibility with
previous versions of print.  If no file name has been found, a number
is interpreted as a file name; other numeric arguments are interpreted
as -from and -to, in that order.  You can use -name to indicate that a
number is intended as a pathname.

You can supply more than one -match and more than one -exclude; a line
is printed if any -match selects it unless one -exclude prevents it
from being printed.
