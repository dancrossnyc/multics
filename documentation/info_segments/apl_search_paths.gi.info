01/12/82  APL Search Paths

The MR9.0 release of APL offers the ability for the site and/or the
user to specify search paths to be used by the APL executive when
searching for an external function or a workspace to be loaded.  This
permits the site and/or the user to designate one or more directories
as libraries of workspaces and external functions.  If no search paths
are defined for APL, workspaces and external functions are searched
for in the same way as with previous versions of APL.

The user may determine if the site has defined search paths for APL
and, if so, what they are, by entering the command 'print_search_paths
apl'.  If the site does not define any search paths for APL, the user
may do so with the 'set_search_paths' command.  Once search paths have
been defined for APL, the user may use the 'add_search_paths' and
'delete_search_paths' commands to modify them.


Effect of search paths on the ')LOAD' command:
If the workspace in a ')LOAD' command is identified by an entry name
rather than an absolute or relative pathname, it is searched for first
in the directories specified by any APL search paths, and then in the
user's working directory.


Effects of search paths on the ')DFN', ')MFN' & ')ZFN' commands:
If the function in an external function definition command is
identified by a reference name rather than an absolute or relative
pathname, it is searched for first among the already initiated
segments, then in the directories specified by any APL search paths,
and finally according to the current search rules.


Effects of search paths on the 'qCALL' function:
'qCALL' searches for the external routine it is to invoke first among
the already initiated segments, then in the directories specified by
any APL search paths, and finally according to the current search
rules.  If any of the arguments to the external routine to be called
are themselves external routines, they are searched for in the same
way.
