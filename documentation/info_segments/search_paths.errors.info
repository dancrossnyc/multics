Known errors in the current release of search_paths.

Description

22  phx14598
The search_paths_$get entrypoint returns the sl_info structure.  The
list_header.update_count field is not incremented if the entire search
list is deleted.  Therefore, an obsolete version of some search_list is
used because it does not know that the list is absolete.

Assume you have a link named forum.search that points to an object
segment that does not contain the forum_search_ cds component; but it
contains another component with an entrypoint called "forum", then the
print_search_paths command displays a totally useless error message.
For example:

  ! cwd [pd]
  ! ac x >ldd>unb>o>bound_forum_ forum
  ! in forum forum.search -fc
  ! dsp forum -a
  ! psp forum
    Error:  area condition by search_paths_$set|3513
    (>sss>bound_search_facility_)
    Either a variable could not be allocated in an area
    or an area could not be assigned to an existing area.
    system handler for error returns to command level


The search_paths_ could do a much better job of validating that
forum.search$forum is a search list default segment before it goes off
and tries it.  It should print the following message:

"search_list_pathname is not a search list default segment"

rather than taking a fault.

The EXL add_search_paths commands gets error when it adds a specified
search path name which has an hyphen appeared anywhere in that name to
a specified search list.  For example:

  ! in >exl>sfd>execution>add_search_paths
  ! add_search_paths compose >udd>m>TLNguyen>compose-links
    add_search_paths: Specified control argument is not accepted.
                      >udd>m>TLNguyen>compose-links

Note that the add_search_paths in the >sss library does not get this
error.  So Barry Margolin guesses that the hyphen appeared anywhere in
the search path has caused this error.


14  phx12901
The -no_force control arg for add_search_rules is not implemented.

12  phx12051
add_search_paths allows a path to be entered into a list more than one,
differing only by add names.

11  phx11940
For certain errors, delete_search_rules identifies itself as
'add_search_rules'.


9  phx09886
The search facility doesnt handle explicitly null paths (ie, those
given as "") correctly.

6  phx11766
delete_search_paths does not honor the short keywords -hd, -pd, -rd,
and -wd.


4  phx03790 phx09883 phx12818 phx13325 phx14166
The add_search_paths command displays wrong input argument in the error
message after it found that that input argument is invalid.  For
example:

   ! asp trans -before -working_dir foo
     add_search_paths:  Specified control argument is not accepted. -before

It must report the invalid argument that it just found such as
-working_dir in this example.

3  phx03555 phx05116 phx07934 phx13432
add_search_paths has no feature that allows moving a search path in a
search list, ie., there is no -force control arg.
