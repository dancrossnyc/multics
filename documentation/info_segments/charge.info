Syntax:  charge


Function: allows the accounting administrator to enter miscellaneous charges
into the miscfile for billing purposes.  For each transaction, the
Project_id, the amount, and an explanation are required.  All three
input items for a transaction can be put on the same line or they can
be supplied one at a time.  To exit from this command, type "x"
instead of a Project_id.  The miscfile segment is printed using the
pmisc command.  Credits and deletions are made to the miscfile using
the credit and dmisc commands, respectively.
