Syntax:  enm path equal_path


Syntax as active function:  [enm path equal_path]


Function:  returns a pathname, constructed by applying the equal
convention, to the specified arguments.


Arguments:
path
   is the source pathname to which the equal convention is applied.
   The archive component pathname convention is allowed.
equal_path
   is a pathname whose entryname and component name portions are equal
   names.


Notes:  Since the pathname is returned in quotes, the command processor
treats it as a single argument regardless of special characters in the
name.  This active function provides a means of applying equal names
within abbreviations and exec_com segments.

For a complete description of the equal convention see the Programmer's
Reference Manual.
