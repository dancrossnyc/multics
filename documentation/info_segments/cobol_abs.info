02/28/84  cobol_abs, cba

Syntax:  cba paths {-cobol_args} {-dp_args} {-control_args}


Function: submits an absentee request to perform COBOL compilations.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments to be compiled.
cobol_args
   are control arguments accepted by the cobol command.
dp_args
   are control arguments (except -delete) accepted by the dprint
   command.


Control arguments:
-queue N, -q N
   is the priority queue of the request.  The default queue is defined
   by the system administrator.  (See "Notes.")
-hold
   does not dprint or delete any listing files.
-output_file path, -of path
   put absentee output in the segment path.
-limit N, -li N
   specifies time limit in seconds for the absentee job.


Notes: Control arguments and paths can be mixed freely and can appear
anywhere on the command line after the command.

Unpredictable results may occur if two absentee requests are submitted
that simultaneously attempt to compile the same segment or write into
the same absout segment.


If -queue is not specified, the request is submitted into the default
absentee priority queue defined by the site and, if requested, the
listing files are dprinted in the default queue of the request
type supplied on the command line.  (If no request type is given,
the "printer" request type is used.)

If -queue is specified, the listing files are dprinted in the same
queue used for the absentee request.  If the request type specified
for dprinting does not have that queue, the highest numbered queue
available for the request type is used and a warning is issued.
