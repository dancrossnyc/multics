08/02/84  gcos_tss_build_library, gtbl

Syntax as a command:  gtbl input_libs {-control_args}


Function:  This command builds or updates the GCOS software library,
gtss_fast_library_, used by gcos_tss, and updates the program
descriptors required to access the added software.


Arguments:
input_libs
   are the pathnames of one or more GCOS software libraries.  The input
   libraries are either in native GCOS format (as copied from a GCOS
   total system tape) or in GCOS environment simulator format (as
   output from gcos_build_library).


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of information concerning updated modules and
   program descriptors and the catalog, even if requested by the
   -print_catalog control argument.
-module_file path, -mf path
   path specifies the segment containing a list of modules to be moved
   from the input libraries to the output library.  These names are
   added to those specified by the -module control argument.
-modules STR1 {...STRn}, -mods STR1 {...STRn}
   STRi specifies the name of the module to be moved from an input
   library to the output library.  These names are added to those
   specified by the -module_file control argument.


-output_library path, -olb path
   specifies the path of the gtss_fast_library_ output library.  If the
   library already exists, it is appended to.
-print_catalog, -prcat
   prints the catalog (modules and offsets) of an input library if the
   library is in simulator format.
-program_descriptors path, -prgdes path
   path specifies the gtss program descriptors (a copy of
   gtss_prgdes_alm_.incl.alm) to be updated.


Notes:  If no output library path is specified, then only a list of the
modules found on the input libraries is printed.

To use the added modules in gtss, the -prgdes control argument must be
used.  Then gts_prgdes_ext_.alm must be reassembled with the
gtss_prgdes_alm_.incl.alm specified by -prgdes.  Following this, gtss
must be rebound with the new gtss_prgdes_ext_, and the updated output
library must be copied to gtss_fast_library_ in the directory
containing gtss (or a link established).

This is the only procedure required to add PSP or user software to the
gcos_tss library for which there are program descriptors.


If the -modules and -module_ file control arguments are not specified,
then all modules found on the input libraries are copied to the output
library.  The only exception is when the -prgdes control argument is
specified.  In this case, only modules on the input libraries, which
are actually needed by the program descriptor file, are copied.
