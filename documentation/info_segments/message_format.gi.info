12/07/83  Mail System Message Format

A message is the basic unit of communication between users.

There are two types of message: ordinary and interactive.  An
interactive message is a message which is displayed immediately on the
user's terminal when it is delivered.  An ordinary message is a message
which is only displayed at the user's explicit request after it has
been delivered.  Whenever the mail system delivers an ordinary message
to a user, it also delivers an interactive message to inform the user
that the ordinary message was just delivered.


Message structure:
The mail system represents a message as a structured object comprised
of four parts: an envelope, a header, a redistributions list, and a
body.  With the exception of the body, each of these parts contains
several fields.

The message envelope describes when, by whom, and via what route the
message was mailed and subsequently delivered.

The message header contains the message's subject, author(s), and
recipient(s).  For a message which is a reply to other messages, the
header contains information which identifies those original messages.
The header may also contain additional fields which are used by user
written application programs.


The redistributions list records each time the message was
redistributed (forwarded) by one user to another.  The information
recorded for each redistribution includes the user(s) who requested the
redistribution, the date/time it was requested, the recipient(s) of the
redistribution, and an optional comment.

The message body is the actual content of the message.  The body is
divided into one or more sections.  Each section may have its own
distinct structure and formatting instructions.


List of message envelope fields:
Posted-Date
   is the date/time that the message was given to the mail system for
   delivery.  This field is only present if the message was not created
   and posted simultaneously.
Sender
   is the address of the actual user who gave the message to the mail
   system for delivery.  This field is only present if there is more
   than one author of the message or if the author was not the user who
   gave the message to the mail system.
Route
   is only present in messages which originated on another computer
   system and lists the systems through which the message was relayed
   in order to reach this system.


Relayed
   is only present in messages which originated on another computer
   system and describes a single relay operation.  This field includes
   the date/time of the relay, the sending and receiving systems, and
   an optional description of the protocols used.  This field may
   appear in the message more than once.
Delivery-Date
   is the date/time that the mail system delivered this message to the
   user's mailbox.  This field is only present if the message was not
   posted and delivered simultaneously.
Delivery-By
   is the address of the actual user in whose process the mail system
   delivered this message to the user's mailbox.  This field is only
   present if the delivery agent was different from the sender.


Acknowledge-To
   is the address of the user who is to receive an acknowledgement when
   this message is read by a recipient.  This field is only present if
   the message requests an acknowledgement.


List of message header fields:
   With the exception of the Date, From, Access-Class, and Message-ID
   fields, all fields in the message header are optional.

Date
   is the date/time that the message body was created.
From
   is the list of addresses of the user(s) responsible for the content
   of the message.  These users are also known as the authors of the
   message.
Subject
   is the subject of the message.


Reply-To
   is the list of addresses of the recipients for any future replies to
   this message.  If this field is not present, replies will be sent to
   the authors as listed in the From field.
To
   is the list of addresses of the primary recipients of the message.
cc
   is the list of addresses of the secondary recipients of the message.
bcc
   is the list of addresses of the "blind" recipients of the message.
   The copies of the message delivered to the primary and secondary
   recipients do not include this list.


In-Reply-To
   is the list of references to the messages for which this message is
   a reply.  Each reference includes the values of the referenced
   message's Date, From, Subject, and Message-ID fields.
Access-Class
   is the Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM) access class of the message.
   A user may read the message only if his process authorization is
   greater than or equal to this access class; a user may delete the
   message only if his authorization is equal to this access class.
Message-ID
   is the unique identifier associated with the body of the message.
   If two messages have the same value for this field, they contain the
   same message body; however, their envelopes, headers, and
   redistribution lists may differ.


List of message redistribution fields:
   In addition to the fields described in this, each redistribution
   also has its own envelope which contains the fields described above.
   For a redistribution, however, the envelope fields are called
   Redistributed-Posted-Date, Redistributed-Sender, etc.  With the
   exception of the Redistributed-Date, Redistributed-From, and
   Redistributed-Message-ID fields, all fields in a redistribution are
   optional.

Redistributed-Date
   is the date/time that the redistribution was requested and the
   redistribution's comment, if any, was created.
Redistributed-From
   is the list of addresses of the user(s) who requested that the
   redistribution take place.


Redistributed-To
   is the list of addresses of the recipients of the redistribution.
Redistributed-Comment
   is the text of the comment associated with the redistribution of the
   message.
Redistributed-Message-ID
   is the unique identifier associated with the redistribution.  If two
   redistributions in multiple copies of a message have the same value
   for this field, they are the same redistribution.


Printed representation of a message:
The printed representation of a message is the human readable form of
that message.  It is used by the mail system when displaying a message.


The basic format of the printed representation is --

     <envelope>
     <header>
     <redistributions list>

     <body>

where <envelope> is the printed representation of the message envelope,
etc.  As can be seen from the above, the printed representation of the
message body is separated from the other parts of the message by a
blank line; the printed representations of the envelope, header, and
redistributions list, on the other hand, are contiguous.


The user may request that different levels of detail should be used
when displaying the contents of the envelope, header, and
redistributions list.  The message header and redistributions list may
be displayed in long, default, or brief form; the message envelope may
be displayed only in long or default form.


Printed representation of the message envelope:
The long form of the printed representation of the message envelope
follows:

     Posted-Date:  <date-string>
     Sender:  <address>
     Route:  <address-route>
     Relayed:  from <sending-host> to <receiving-host> using
	     <mail-protocol> with <comm-protocol> via <comm-media> ID
	     <message-id> for <address>; <date-string>
     Relayed:  ...
     Delivery-Date:  <date-string>
     Delivery-By:  <address>
     Acknowledge-To:  <address>


The Route and Relayed fields are only displayed in the long form of the
message envelope.  The first Relayed field displayed describes the
oldest relay operation and the last Relayed field describes the most
recent relay operation.

The Acknowledge-To field is only displayed if the message requests an
acknowledgement.


In the long form of the message envelope, all fields except the Route,
Relayed, and Acknowledge-To fields are displayed.  If the Posted-Date
field is not present, the value of the Date field in the message header
is used; if the Delivery-Date field is not present, the value of the
Posted-Date field (or, if needed, the Date field) is used.  If the
Sender field is not present, the single address in the From field of
the message header is used; if the Delivery-By field is not present,
the value of the Sender field (or, if needed, the From field) is used.

In the default form of the message envelope, the Posted-Date field is
displayed only if its value differs from the Date field of the message
header; the Delivery-Date field is displayed only if its value differs
from the Posted-Date field.  The Sender field is displayed on if its
value differs from the From field of the message header; the
Delivery-By field is displayed only if its value differs from the
Sender field.


Printed representation of the message header:
The long form of the printed represenation of the message header
follows:

     Date:  <long-date-string>
     From:  <address-list>
     Subject:  <text-string>
     Reply-To:  <address-list>
     To:  <address-list>
     cc:  <address-list>
     bcc:  <address-list>
     In-Reply-To:  <message-reference-list>
     Access-Class:  <AIM-class>
     Message-ID:  <message-id>
     <user-field-name>:  <field-value>
     <user-field-name>:  ...


The optional fields in the message header are not displayed unless they
are present in the header.  (Ie: the field name will not be displayed
without a subsequent field value).

The Access-Class field is always displayed in the long form of the
header.  It is ommitted from the default form if it is equal to the
user's process authorization.  It is always ommitted from the brief
form of the header.

The Message-ID field is only displayed in the long form of the header.


In the brief form of the message header, the Date and From fields are
always displayed.  The Subject field is displayed if present.  None of
the other fields in the header are displayed.  However, if the user is
not the only recipient of the message, the following psuedo-field is
displayed in place of the To, cc, and bcc fields:

     Recipients:  {Yourself and} N others

where N is the number of recipients of the message in addition to the
user.  The string "Yourself and" is displayed only if the user is
explicitly mentioned in one of the To, cc, or bcc fields.


Printed representation of the redistributions list:
The long form of the printed representation of the redistributions list
follows:

     <redistribution-1>
     .....
     <redistribution-N>

where <redistribution-1> is the first (oldest) redistribution of the
message and <redistribution-N> is the last (latest) redistribution of
the message.


The long form of the printed representation of a single redistribution
follows:

     <envelope>
     Redistributed-Date:  <date-string>
     Redistributed-From:  <address-list>
     Redistributed-To:  <address-list>
     Redistributed-Comment:
	     <text-string>
     Redistributed-Message-ID:  <message-id>

where <envelope> is the printed representation of the redistribution's
envelope as described above.  However, all field names in the envelope
are prefixed with the string "Redistributed-".  The redistribution
envelope's printed representation is ommitted from the brief form of
the redistribution.


The optional fields in the redistribution are not displayed unless they
are present in the redistribution.  (Ie: the field name will not be
displayed without a subsequent field value).

In the brief form of a redistribution, the Redistributed-To field is
replaced by a Redistributed-Recipients psuedo-field as described above
for the To, cc, and bcc fields.

The Redistributed-Message-ID field is ommitted from the default and
brief forms of the redistribution.

The entire redistribution is ommitted from the brief form of the
redistributions list if it does contain a comment.


If the last redistribution is ommitted from the brief form of the
redistributions list, the Last-Redistributed psuedo field is displayed
in its place.  The format of this field is

      Last-Redistributed:  <date-string> by <address>


Canonical form of a message:
The canonical form of a message is a variant of the default form of the
printed representation of the message.  The canonical form is used by
the mail system when storing the message in a mailbox or searching the
message for a given character string.


The canonical form of a message differs from the default printed
representation as follows:

In the canonical form, the redistributions list appears before the
message envelope; in the default printed representation, it appears
after the message header.

In the canonical form, the redistributions appear in reverse
chronological order (ie: the latest redistribution is first, etc.); in
the default printed representation, they are in chronological order.

The Message-ID, Route, and Relayed fields are included in the canonical
form; they are omitted from the default printed representation.


List of field value representations:
<date-string>
   is the printed representation of a date/time.  Its format is
         DD Month YYYY HH:MM zone
   For example:
         9 April 1983 12:17 edt

<long-date-string>
   is the printed representation of a date/time.  Its format is
         DayName, DD Month YYYY HH:MM zone
   For example:
         Saturday, 9 April 1983 12:17 edt


<address>
   is the printed representation of the address in the given field.
   For a description of these representations, type:
         help addresses.gi -section printed representations

<address-list>
   is the printed representation of a list of addresses.  Its format is
         <address-1>, <address-2>, ..., <address-N>

<address-route>
   is the printed representation of an address route.  For a
   description of this representation, type:
         help addresses.gi -section printed representations


<text-string>
   is the printed representation of the text comprising the given
   field.  This representation consists of the acutal text with two
   exceptions.  If the text is more than one line long, each additional
   line is indented by an amount equal to the indentation of the first
   line of the text  If any line in the text is blank, the string "--"
   is placed on that line just before the left margin of actual text.
   For example:
        Subject:  Sample text field that is multiple lines
		   with some lines indented more than others
	      --
	         and also some blank lines.


<message-reference-list>
   is the printed representation of a set of message references.  The
   printed representation of a single message reference has the
   following format:
         Message of <date-string> from <address-name>
   where <address-name> is the address name of the first address in the
   From field of the referenced message.  If this address does not have
   a name, its printed representation is used instead.  For example:
         Message of 1 May 1983 17:49 edt from Gary Palter
   If the list contains multiple references, they are separated by
   commas and the second through last references are indented by
   sufficient whitespace to align them with the first reference.  For
   example:
         In-Reply-To:  Message of 9 April 1983 14:50 edt ...,
		   Message of 1 May 1983 10:17 edt from ...


<AIM-class>
   is the printed representation of an AIM access class as returned by
   the standard system subroutine convert_authorization_$to_string_short.

<message-id>
   is the printed representation of a unique identifier.  Its format is
         <STR {at HOST}>
   where STR is the actual unique identifier which, if generated by a
   Multics system, will be the long form of a request ID.  (Type:
         help request_ids.gi
   for a description of the format of a request ID).  If the identifier
   was generated by a foreign system, that system's name is included in
   the printed representation in the "at HOST' phrase.  The angle
   brackets (<>) above are actually part of the representation; the
   braces ({}) are not.


<user-field-name>
   is the name of a user-defined field in the message header.

<field-value>
   is the printed representation of the value of a user-defined field.
   It will be a <date-string>, <address-list>, or <text-string>.

<sending-host>
   is the name of the sending system for a relay operation.

<receiving-host>
   is the name of the receiving system for a relay operation.


<mail-protocol>
   is the name of the mail transport protocol used for a relay
   operation.

<comm-protocol>
   is the name of the communications protocol used for a relay
   operation.

<comm-media>
   is the name of the communications media used for a relay operation.
