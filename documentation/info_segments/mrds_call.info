Syntax:  mrc function_name {args}


Function:	 Provides a command level interface to the Multics Relational Data
Store (MRDS) Data Sublanguage, which is a subroutine interface dsl_ with
several entry points.


Arguments:
function_name
   this is the name of one of the dsl_ entry points, or one of the two
   mrds_call functions list_dbs or set_modes.  The dsl entry points available
   are close, declare, define_temp_rel, delete, dl_scope, dl_scope_all,
   get_population, get_scope, modify, open, retrieve, set_scope, set_scope_all,
   and store.
args
   these are the individual arguments required by a particular dsl_ entry
   point, such as database index and relation name for store, or pathname and
   open mode for open.  See the particular dsl_ entry point help file for
   details.


Notes:  None of the dsl_ functions require the inclusion of the error code
argument, as this will be reported via com_err_ if non-zero.

The argument order is the same as for the corresponding dsl_ entry point.

For entries that take a selection expression, it can be given in quotes, or the
last argument can be -segment, -sm path to take the selection expression from a
segment.

Scope modes are encoded to the characters n, r, a(or s), d, m, and u.	 Opening
modes are encoded to the characters r, u, er, and eu.

Retrieve is a special case, the number of values to be retrieved must be given
before the database index argument.  In addition, if the last argument is -all,
successive -another calls will be made, to retrieve all data statisfying the
conditions.

The funtion close will accept a database index, or -all.

The function list_dbs takes no arguments.

The funtion set_modes takes the arguments list/no_list, and long_err/short_err
to control the amount of output from mrds_call.


Examples:
mrds_call open dept_store eu

The open data base is:
1	>udd>m>jg>dr>dept_store
	exclusive_update

mrds_call store 1 emp 1 1 1 1 1 1

mrds_call retrieve 6 1 "-range (e emp) -select e" -all

The values are:

1
	1
1
	1
	   1.00
	   1.00

(END)

mrds_call close -all
