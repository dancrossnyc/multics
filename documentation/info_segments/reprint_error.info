10/17/84  reprint_error, re

Syntax as a command:  re {-control_args}


Function:  makes the system condition handler print its message for a
condition that has already been handled and for which stack history is
preserved.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints messages corresponding to all existing sets of condition
   information.
-brief, -bf
   prints the short form of the message.
-depth N, -dh N
   indicates which instance of saved fault information is to be used
   for the message; the most recent instance is depth 1.  Make -depth
   appear only once per command line.  (Default: 1)
-long, -lg
   prints the long form of the message.


Notes:  If you select no control argument, the default selects less
extensive information than -long.

The message mode options for reprint_error have no effect on the
operation.
