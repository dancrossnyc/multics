:Entry: define_area_: 02/08/84  define_area_

Function: initializes a region of storage as an area and enables
special area management features.  The region being initialized may or
may not consist of an entire segment or may not even be specified at
all, in which case a segment is acquired (from the free pool of
temporary segments) for the caller.

See the release_area_ subroutine for a description of how to free up
segments acquired via this interface.


Syntax:
declare define_area_ entry (ptr, fixed bin(35));
call define_area_ (info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
info_ptr
   points to the standard area_info structure used by the various area
   management routines and is declared in area_info.incl.pl1.  (Input)
code
   is a system status code.  (Output)


Notes:  The define_area_ subroutine gives the user more control over an
area than is defined in the PL/I language.  The PL/I empty built-in
function cannot empty a define_area_ area; the release_area_ subroutine
must be used instead.  PL/I offset values and PL/I area assignment
cannot be used with extensible areas.  In PL/I, an area variable is
always initialized.  Consequently, if a based area is overlayed upon
arbitrary storage instead of being allocated with a PL/I allocate
statement, then the define_area_ subroutine must be used to turn the
contents of the based area into a PL/I area value.
