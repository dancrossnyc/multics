Syntax:  decode path1A {path2A ... path1N path2N} {-control_args}


Function: reconstructs an original segment from an enciphered segment
according to a key that is not stored in the system.  The encode
command is used to encipher segments.


Arguments:
path1A
   is the pathname of an enciphered segment.  The code suffix should
   not be specified.  The star convention is allowed.
path2A
   is the pathname of the deciphered segment to be produced.  If the
   last path2 is not given, a pathname is constructed from path1.
   The equal convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-key STR
   specifies the encipherment key STR on the command line and does not
   query for one. This control argument is useful in exec_com's for
   multiple invocations of the command with the same key.


Notes: This command requests the key from the terminal only once.  All
segments specified in an invocation of decode are deciphered with the
same key.
