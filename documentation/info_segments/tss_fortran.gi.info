The  following  is  a  list  and brief description of the fortran
modules on the tss_fortran_ library.

   ampb1     computes the derivative and store the  functions
             and derivatives at each step of the integration.

   ampb2     integrates to the next step. The values  of  the
             functions  and  derivatives at the next step will be
             stored.

   anpf      This fortran function computes the probability  that
             the  normal  distributed random variable with a mean
             and standard deviation lies  between  two  specified
             numbers.

   beta      This fortran function will evaluate  the  cumulative
             probabilities  and  percentage  points  of  the Beta
             distribution.

   corrl2    This  fortran  program  measures   the   association
             between   two   sets  of  N  elements  each  by  the
             Spearman-Rank Correlation Coeficient.

   eig1      This fortran subroutine finds  the  Eigenvalues  and
             Eigenvectors  of  a  real  symmetric  matrix  by the
             JACOBI-CORBATO method. It is used by eigsr.

   eigsr     This fortan program  computes  the  Eigenvalues  and
             Eigenvectors  of  a  real symmetric matrix.  It uses
             the subroutine eig1.


   errf      This fortran function evaluate the error function or
             its complement.

   flat      This is  a  function  subroutine  calculates  random
             numbers having a uniform distribution.

   gasp      is a set of fortran  subroutines  that  provide  the
             programmer with a fortran-based simulation language,
             used to simulate event-oriented systems.

   gaspsamp  is a demonstration program for gasp.  It requires an
             input date file.

   kilter    This fortran program solves minimal cost circulation
             network  problem  using the out-of-kilter algorithm.

   linefit   This fortran subroutine finds the least squares line
             to describe a set of data points.

   lineq     This  fortran  subroutine   solves   a   system   of
             simultaneous     linear    equations    with    real
             coefficients.

   lnprog    This fortran program computes the  optimum  solution
             for linear programming problems.

   maxflow   This fortran program finds  maximum  flow  from  the
             source  node  to the sink node in a directed network
             using a maximum flow, minimum cut algorithm.

   mreg1     This fortran program uses multiple regressions in an
             attempt to curve fit observed data by the model:

              y-ymean = a(1)(x(1)-x1mean) +...+ a(p)(x(p)-xpmean)


   mtinv     This fortran  subroutine  inverts  a  matrix  and/or
             solves linear systems by standard elimination.

   mtmpy     This fortran routine evaluates the  product  of  two
             matrices.

   orpol     This fortran program determines  the  least  squares
             coefficients.

   plot      This fortran subroutine  plots  a  maximum  of  nine
             curves simultaneously.

   rkpb1     will compute the derivatives and store the functions
             and derivatives at each step of the integration.

   rkpb2     will integrate to the next step.  The values of  the
             functions  and  derivatives at the next step will be
             stored.

   rndnrm    This fortran function computes psuedo-randum numbers
             having a normal distribution.

   secant    This fortran subroutine uses the  secant  method  to
             solve  the nolinear system of equations F(X)=0 where
             F and X are N dimensional vectors.

   shortest  This fortran program  finds  the  shortest  distance
             from  the  initial  node  of  a network to all other
             nodes and indicates the path used to  achieve  those
             distances.

   smlrp     SMLRP (Stepwise Multiple Linear Regression  Program)
             computes  in  a  stepwise  manner  the  least square
             "best" value or the coefficients of an  equation  of
             the form:

              Y = B(0) + B(1)X(1) + B(2)X(2) + . . . + B(n)X(x)

   stat      This fortran program  processes  a  series  of  data
             points  and  computes several fundamental statistics
             of the data.

   tdist     This   fortran   function    evaluates    cumulative
             probabilities   and   percentage   points   of   the
             T-distribution (2-tail).
