07/07/88  fortran.new_features.info

This info segment provides temporary documentation for new features of
the  MR12.2 FORTRAN compiler which may not have been documented in the
manual yet.


Current topics:

   Character variables can now be up to 128K-1 characters long.
   Character constants can be up to 512 characters long.


Character variables:

The maximum length of Fortran character variables has been increased
to 131071 (128K-1) for MR12.2. Prior to this it was 512. Constructs
like the following are now allowed:

      character a*128000

However, character constants (strings) are still limited to 512
characters long.

When using many large character variables, the compiler may issue the
message:

 FATAL ERROR 414:
 Implementation restriction: with the relocation of <Variable> in main_
 the stack frame has overflowed its limit of 62000 words.

This can be eliminated by compiling with the -large_array,-la option.


Character Constants:

 Character constants (strings) may now be up to 512 characters long.
Previously, they were limited to 256 characters.
