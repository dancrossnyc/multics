08/02/84  set_mrds_temp_dir, smtd

Syntax as a command:  smtd directory_path


Function:  In the next call to dsl_$open this command changes the
current pathname of the directory that is used for temporary storage.
The temporary storage used is for the "resultant model" built during
open time, for temporary relation storage, and for intermediate search
results.  The initial default for this directory is the process_dir.
This command need only be used prior to the particular opening where a
very large resultant model is built, large temporary relations are to
be defined, or searches involving many tuples in several relations are
to be done.  A record quota overflow in the process directory during a
call to dsl_$open, dsl_$retrieve, or dsl_$define_temp_rel indicates
this need.


Arguments:
directory_path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of a directory with more quota
   than the current temporary directory.  The initial default is to use
   the process directory.


Notes:  The temporary directory may be changed between calls to
dsl_$open, thus resulting in different temporary directories for each
opening.  These may be displayed via display_mrds_temp_dir.

This command should only be used to avoid a record quota overflow in
the process directory upon a call to dsl_$open, dsl_$retrieve, or
dsl_$define_tem_rel.  If a record quota overflow occurs in one of these
calls, do a new_process, then set_mrds_temp_dir with a pathname of a
directory that has more quota.  If another record quota overflow occurs
in that directory, set_mrds_temp_dir can be used again giving a
directory with even more quota.

See dsl_$set_temp_dir for a subroutine interface.
