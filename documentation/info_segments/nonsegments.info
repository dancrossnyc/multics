01/14/87  nonsegments, nonsegs

Syntax as a command:  nonsegs star_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [nonsegs star_names {-control_args}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of directories,
multisegment files (MSFs), or links that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_names
   are star names to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.
-chase
   processes the targets of links when you specify a starname.
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   returns false if star_name is an invalid name or if access to tell
   of an entry's existence is lacking.
-no_chase
   does not process the targets of links when you specify a starname.
   (Default)
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   signals an error if star_name is an invalid name or if access to
   tell of an entry's existence is lacking.  (Default)


Notes:  Only one name per entry is returned; i.e., if a directory, MSF,
or link has more than one name that matches star_name, only the first
match found is returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by nonsegs is enclosed in
quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.
