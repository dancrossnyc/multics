Control arguments:

   specifies all data are to be printed.
-day
   asks for a list of all the day names.
-format, -fmt
   asks for a list of all keywords that can be given in a time_format
   control string.  This list does not include "date", "date_time", and
   "time" as they are not contained in time_info_.  Use
   print_time_defaults to see them.
-language, -lang
   asks for a list of all the time languages available, showing the
   name of each language in each language.  You would usually use this
   form alone to enable you to see what languages you can refer to.


-language STR, -lang STR
   asks for the output to be given in language STR.  (Default: to show
   requested data in the process default language)
-map
   asks for a time zone map of the world, with all the defined time
   zones and their offsets.  Each zone is at its proper place on this
   map.  The map is horizontally broken according to the line length
   currently in effect.

-token {STR}
   displays the structure used for binary, searching the tokens
   declared in the table.  The display shows all words, with their
   meanings, in all languages, grouped by token.  A token is a word
   converted to lowercase.  If you give STR, then only the data for
   that token is shown.  Since STR represents a token and not a word,
   enter it in lowercase.
-word
   asks for all the miscellaneous words to be printed.
-zone
   asks for a list of all the zones available.
