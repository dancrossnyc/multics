10/20/86  change_symbols, csb

Syntax as a command:  csb symbol {-control_args}


Function:  changes the expansion or suffixing of specified symbol.
Control arguments are processed one at a time.  Specifying more than
one control argument has the same effect as issuing the command several
times with one control argument each time.


Arguments:
symbol
   is the symbol changed.  This symbol must be defined in the current
   symbol dictionary.


Control arguments:
-exp STR
   where STR represents the new expansion STR for this symbol.  This
   control argument does not change the way suffixing is performed for
   the symbol.
-suffix STR
   enables or disables suffixing for this symbol.  STR must be either
   "on" or "off".  If STR is on, then suffixing is enabled and all
   suffixes are processed according to the default rules.  If STR is
   off, then all suffixes are disabled for the symbol.  (Default is
   on.)


-plural STR
   defines the plural suffix for this symbol.  STR must be "on" or
   "off", or a STR that can be used as the plural of the expansion of
   this symbol.  If STR is on, then the plural suffix is enabled for
   this symbol and processed according to the default rules for the
   plural suffix.  If STR is off, the plural suffix is disabled for
   this symbol.
-ed STR
   defines the ed suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.
-ing STR
   defines the ing suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.


-er STR
   defines the er suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.
-ly STR
   defines the ly suffix for this symbol.  This control argument
   follows the same rules as the -plural control argument.
