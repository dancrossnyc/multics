Syntax:  .ifi active_function "active function usage line"
      OR .ifi AF		"active function usage line"


Function:
This macro places an active function usage syntax description on the
page.


Macro action:
1) inserts 24pt. of white space
2) emits the label "SYNTAX AS AN ACTIVE FUNCTION" in 10pt Helvetica
   Bold Italic flush left, followed by white space appropriate for the
   device
3) formats "active function usage line" in 10pt Helvetica (also see
   Notes) at the first indentation level


Notes:
1) If "active function usage line" contains white space, it must be
   given as a quoted string.
2) "active function usage line" may contain both literal fields and
   variable fields.	 These fields are distinguished in the output by
   presenting the variable fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italc instead
   of Roman.  Variable fields are denoted by enclosing them between
   tilde (~) characters.  For example

      "[active_function ~args~ {-~control_args~}]"

   will present "active_function" in Roman and "arg" and "control_args"
   in Bold Italic.
