Syntax for attach description:       discard_

   Any options are ignored.


Function: The discard_ I/O module provides a sink for output and a no-op for
input.  All output operations are supported and return a 0 error code, but
discard any data.  All input operations are supported and return either
error_table_$end_of_info or error_table_$no_record as described below.  The
control and modes operations are also supported as no-op's.

Entries in the module are not called directly by users; rather the
module is accessed through the I/O system.


List of opening modes:
   This module supports all opening modes:
stream_input
stream_output
stream_inpt_output
sequential_input
sequential_output
sequential_input_output
sequential_update
keyed_sequential_input
keyed_sequential_output
keyed_sequential_update
direct_input
direct_output
direct_update


Control Operation:
This module supports the control operation in all opening modes.  All orders
are accepted; but they have no effect.  A 0 error code is always returned, and
the structure pointed to by the info pointer argument is not changed.

Modes Operation:
This module supports modes operation in all opening modes.  It always returns
a null string for the old modes and a 0 error code.


Get Chars, Get Line, and Read Record Operation:
These operations always set the returned length to 0 and the error code to
error_table_$end_of_info.

Put Chars, and Write Record Operation:
These operations simply set the error code to 0 and return.

Position Operation:
This operation simply sets the error code to 0 and returns.


Delete Operation:
This operation sets the error code to error_table_$no_record and returns.

Read Key, and Seek Key Operations:
These operations set the returned length to 0 and the error code
error_table_$no_record.

Read Length Operation:
This operation sets the returned length to 0 and the error code to
error_table_$no_record.


Note:
Table 5-1 in the Multics Programmer's Reference Manual (AG91) describes which
operations are allowed in which opening modes.  This IO module implements all
of the indicated operations in each opening mode (including those operations
qualified by notes in the table).
