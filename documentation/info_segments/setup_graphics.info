Function:  Sets up the I/O switches for graphics input and output.


Control arguments:
-table gdt_name, -tb gdt_name
   specifies the graphic device table for the terminal or graphic device being
   used.  This control argument must be present except when -output_file is
   specified.
-output_file pathname, -of pathname
   routes graphic output to the file specified.  The file will contain Multics
   Graphics Code if -table is not supplied; otherwise it will contain graphics
   code for the device named.


-from switchname {open_mode}, -fm switchname {open_mode}
   specifies the I/O switches to be attached.  This control argument may occur
   multiple times.  The open_mode may be any opening mode accepted by the
   io_call command.  (DEFAULT-- -from graphic_output so -from graphic_input si)
-to switchname
   specifies the target switch to which the graphic switches are to be di-
   rected, through graphic_dim_.  (DEFAULT-- -to tty_i/o -online)


-online
   specifies that all other process I/O switches are to be routed through the
   graphic_dim_.  (DEFAULT for terminal-like devices.)
-offline
   is short for "-to offline_graphics_".
-modes mode_string
   specifies GDT or device modes to be applied (via iox_$changemode) to the
   switches named in the -from control arg(s).

To set up graphics I/O to a Tektronix 4014 terminal, issue the command--

     sg -tb tek_4014

To use the CalComp 915/1036 offline plotter, issue--

     sg -tb calcomp_915 -offline


To route Multics Graphics Code into a file for later use, issue--

     sg -of save.graphics

To route alternate graphics I/O switches to a secondary ARDS terminal dialed to
the process, issue--

     sg -from graphic_output1 so -from graphic_input2 si -to dial_switch
          -table ards
