Syntax as an active function:  [query arg {-control_args}]


Function:	 asks the user a question and returns the value true if the
user's answer to the question is "yes" or false if the user's answer is
"no"; if the user's answer is anything else, the query active function
prints a message asking for a "yes" or "no" answer.


Arguments:
arg
   is the question to be asked.  If the question contains spaces or
   other command language characters, it must be enclosed in quotes.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses extra spacing and newlines when asking questions.
-disable_cp_escape, -dcpe
   disables the ability to escape to the command processor via the ".."
   response.  See "Notes on command processor escape" below.
-enable_cp_escape, -ecpe
   enables the ability to escape to the command processor via the ".."
   response.  See "Notes on command processor escape" below.
-input_switch STR, -isw STR
   specifies the I/O switch to use for input of the user's response.
   The default is user_i/o.
-long, -lg
   adds a leading newline and three trailing spaces to the question.
   This is the default.


-no_trim
   do not trim trailing spaces from the question argument.
-output_switch STR, -osw STR
   specifies the I/O switch to use for output of the question to the
   user.	The default is user_i/o.
-repeat DT, -rp DT
   repeats the question every DT if the user has not responded where DT
   must be in a form suitable for input to the convert_date_to_binary_
   subroutine.
-trim
   trim trailing spaces from the question argument. (Default)


Notes:  The format_line active function can be used to insert other
active function values into the question.


Notes on command processor escape:  The -disable_cp_escape and
-enable_cp_escape control arguments override the system or subsystem
default.	The system default is "enabled".  Subsystems may define the
default to be either "enable" or "disable".  See the command_query_
subroutine for details.
