08/13/84  display_mrds_db_access, dmdba

Syntax as a command:  dmdba path {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays the current access that the user has
to the data for the relations in the supplied view of the data base.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of a data base model or
   submodel, with or without suffix, that supplies the view for which
   the user wishes to see access information.  If both a data model and
   submodel of the same name are in the same directory, then the model
   will be found


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies that a short form of the access information be displayed,
   showing only effective access to the data.
-long, -lg
   specifies that all information related to access be displayed.
   (Default)
-relation rel_name1 ...  rel_nameN
   specifies that only the access for those relations whose names are
   given in the rel_nameI list is to be displayed according to the
   other control arguments.  This control_arg must appear after path.


Notes:  If the data base has been secured, then path must refer to a
secure submodel, unless the user is a DBA.  The user must have
sufficient access to the related model information to open the data
base using the given path.

Control arguments can be overridden, in that the last one specified
takes effect (e.g., -bf followed by -lg implies -lg).

This command only works for version 4 data bases.

The Multics system ACLs, the MRDS access modes, and the result of these
two, an effective access, is displayed for each relation and attribute
in the given view.  Access modes displayed depend on the secured state
of the data base as follows:


     DB SECURED STATE          MODES

           off                 r-e-w
           on                  r-a-m-d

The r-e-w refers to Multics ACLs.  The r-a-m-d refers to the new
attribute level security related operations of read_attr, append_tuple,
modify_attr, and delete_tuple respectively.
