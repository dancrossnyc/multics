02/22/85  set_bit_count, sbc

Syntax as a command:  sbc path1 count1 {...pathN countN}


Function: sets a specified bit count on a specified segment,
multisegment file (MSF), data management (DM) file, or extended entry
and changes the bit count author for that entry to be the user who
invoked the command.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the pathname of the entry.  If pathi is a link, the bit count of
   the entry linked to is set.
counti
   is the bit count, in decimal, desired for pathi.


Access required: You must have write access on the entry whose bit
count is to be set.


Notes: Setting the bit count on a directory is permitted, but several
system modules then regard the directory as a MSF.  (See bit_count.gi
and Section 2 of the Programmer's Reference Manual for a description
of the bit count and bit count author.)
