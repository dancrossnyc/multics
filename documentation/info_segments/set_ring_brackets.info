02/22/85  set_ring_brackets, srb

Syntax as a command:  srb path {ring_numbers}


Function: allows you to modify the ring brackets of a specified
segment, multisegment file (MSF), data management (DM) file, or
extended entry.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the segment, MSF, DM file,
   or extended entry whose ring brackets are to be modified.
ring_numbers
   are the numbers that represent the ring brackets of the segment,
   MSF, DM file, or extended entry.  For a segment or MSF there are
   three ring brackets (rb1 rb2 rb3).  The ring brackets must be in the
   allowable range 0 through 7 and must have the ordering
      rb1 <= rb2 <= rb3


   If you omit rb1, rb2, and rb3, they are set to your current
   validation level.  The rb1 ring bracket is the number to be used as
   the first ring bracket of the segment; if omitted, you can't give
   rb2 and rb3 and rb1, rb2, and rb3 are set to your current validation
   level.  The rb2 ring bracket is the number to be used as the second
   ring bracket of the segment; if omitted, you can't give rb3, and it
   is set, by default, to rb1.  The rb3 ring bracket is the number to
   be used as the third ring bracket of the segment; if omitted, it is
   set to rb2.

   For a DM file there are only two ring brackets (rb1 rb2).  They have
   the same properties as rb1 and rb2 for segments.

   For an extended entry the ring brackets you can give depend on the
   entry type (see describe_entry_type).


Notes: Your process must have a validation level less than or equal to
rb1.  Ring brackets and validation levels are discussed in
"Intraprocess Access Control" of the Programmer's Reference Manual.
