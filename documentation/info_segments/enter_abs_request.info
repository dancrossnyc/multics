03/17/88  enter_abs_request, ear

Syntax as a command:  ear path {-control_args}


Function: allows you to request the creation of an absentee process,
which you can delay until a specified time.  An absentee process
executes commands from a segment and places the output in another
segment.


Arguments:
path
   specifies the pathname of the absentee control segment associated
   with this request.  The absin suffix is assumed.  If a pathname
   is given, it identifies the absin segment.  If only an entryname
   is given, the absin segment is located using the exec_com search
   list.


Control arguments:
-arguments STRs, -argument STRs, -ag STRs
   indicates that the absentee control segment requires arguments.  STR
   can be one or more arguments.  All arguments following -ag are taken
   as arguments to the absentee control segment; therefore put -ag last
   in the command line.


-authorization STR, -auth STR
   sets the authorization of the process to that specified by STR.
   STR is a character string composed of level and category names for
   the desired authorization, separated by commas.  STR cannot contain
   any embedded blank or tab characters.  (The short names for each
   level and category always contain no blanks or tabs, and can be
   used whenever the corresponding long names contain blanks or tabs.)
   STR must represent an authorization that is within the range of
   minimum and maximum authorization of Person_id on the Project_id.
   If -authorization is omitted, your current login authorization is
   used.  (See the Programmer's Reference Manual for more information
   about process authorizations.)  Allowed authorization range can be
   displayed via the "user auth_range" command.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "ID:  HHMMSS.f; N already requested."


-comment STR, -com STR
   associates a comment with the request.  If STR contains blanks or
   other command language characters, enclose it in quotes.  The
   comment is printed whenever you or the operator lists the request.
   It indicates to the operator the time or circumstances when a
   deferred job should be released, such as when a specified reel of
   tape is delivered to the computer room.
-defer_indefinitely, -dfi
   does not run the absentee process until the operator starts it.
-extend
   append output of the absentee process to the absout file (default).
   Provided to override the -truncate argument.


-foreground, -fg
   places the request in the foreground queue, rather than in one of
   the numbered background queues.  For load control and charging
   purposes, jobs in the foreground queue are treated as interactive
   logins; that is, a foreground job is logged in as if you would have
   logged in interactively, and, while logged in, it occupies a primary
   slot in your load control group.  (See -secondary.)
-home_dir path, -hd path
   sets the home directory of the absentee process to the path
   specified, if the project administrator allows such changes.
   The "user attributes" command displays allowed attributes.  The
   vhomedir attribute is required to use the -home_dir control
   argument.  The specified home dir cannot exceed 64 characters and
   must be specified as an absolute pathname.


-limit N, -li N
   places a limit on the CPU time used by the absentee process.  The
   parameter N must be a positive decimal integer specifying the limit
   in seconds.  The default limit is defined by the site for each
   queue.  An upper limit is defined by the site for each queue on each
   shift.  Jobs with limits exceeding the upper limit for the current
   shift are deferred to a shift with a higher limit.
-long_id, -lgid
   prints the long form of the request identifier in the normal
   message:
      ID: yymmddHHMMSS.ffffff; N already requested


-no_start_up, -ns
   instructs the standard process overseer not to execute the
   start_up.ec segment in the absentee process, if the project
   administrator allows it.  The "user attributes" command displays
   allowed attributes.  The nostartup attribute is required to use
   this control argument.
-notify, -nt
   notifies you (by an interactive message sent to your mailbox) when
   the job is logged in, when it is logged out, or when it is deferred
   for any reason other than your request.  The latter might occur
   because of the unavailability of resources or a time limit higher
   than the maximum for the shift.
-output_file path, -of path
   specifies the pathname of the output segment (see "Notes" below).


-process_overseer path, -po path
   sets the process overseer for the absentee process to the procedure
   given by path if the project administrator allows this.  If path
   ends in the characters ",direct", the specified procedure is called
   directly during process initialization rather than by the standard
   system-provided procedure.  This means that the program used by
   path must perform the tasks that would have been performed by the
   standard procedure.  The length of the process_overseer path should
   not exceed 64 characters.  The "user attributes" command displays
   allowed attributes.  The vinitproc attribute is required to use
   this control argument.


-proxy User_id
   enters the request on behalf of the specified user.  An absentee
   process of that User_id is logged in to run the job.  The system
   administrator controls the use of -proxy by an access control
   segment.  See Notes for details.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies that absentee queue N should contain the request to be
   entered, where N is an integer specifying the number of the queue.
   The default queue is designated by the site administrator.  There
   are four background queues, with queue 1 having the highest
   priority.  The highest numbered queue processed on each shift is
   determined by the site.  For convenience in writing exec_coms and
   abbreviations, the word "foreground" (fg) following -queue performs
   the same function as -foreground.


-resource STR, -rsc STR
   specifies resources given in STR (e.g., one or more tape drives);
   don't start them until they are available.  These resources are also
   reserved for the absentee job before it is logged in.  Resource
   reservation (via the reserve_resource command) need not be done in
   the absin segment.  Enclose the resource description in quotes if it
   contains blanks or other command language characters.
-restart, -rt
   starts over the computation of this request from the beginning if
   interrupted (for example, by a system crash).  (Default: not to
   restart the computation)


-ring N, -rg N
   sets the initial ring to N if this ring number is within the range
   of the registered minimum ring and maximum ring.  This range may
   be displayed via the "user ring_range" command.
-secondary
   logs in a foreground job as a secondary user (subject to preemption)
   if there are no primary slots available in your load control group.
   By default a foreground job is only logged in if a primary process
   can be created for you.
-sender STR
   enters requests only from sender STR.  In most cases the sender is
   an RJE station identifier.
-start_up
   instructs the standard process overseer to execute the start_up.ec
   segment if it exists.  (Default).


-time DT, -tm DT
   delays the creation of the absentee process until a specified
   date-time, where DT must be a character string acceptable to
   convert_date_to_binary_ (see the Subroutines manual).  If DT
   contains blanks, enclose it in quotes.
-truncate, -tc
   truncate the absout file, so that the absentee process will
   begin writing at the beginning of the absout file. See Notes.


Notes:
If you don't supply the pathname of the output segment, the output of
the absentee process is directed to a segment whose pathname is the
same as the absentee control segment, having a suffix of absout instead
of absin.  If you omit the absout suffix from the output segment
pathname, the suffix is assumed.  The named output segment may or may
not already exist.

If the absout segment exists, the absentee user (Person_id.Project_id.m
or, in the case of a proxy request, Person_id.Project_id.p) must have w
access to the segment.  If the absout segment does not exist, the
absentee user requires append permission to the directory in which it
is to be created.


The command checks for the existence of the absentee input segment and
rejects a request for an absentee process if it is not present.

The effect of specifying -time is as if enter_abs_request were issued
at the deferred time.  Be aware of differing time zones when deferring
absentee jobs.  If there is a possibility of overlapping times (i.e.,
when est changes to edt, etc.), specify the time zone in the value
given for -time.  If an absentee job cannot be run or if it terminates
abnormally, the system sends an interactive user message to your
mailbox, whether or not you give -notify.


All input and output that occurs in the absentee job is written to the
segment STR.absout in the same directory as the absentee segment
STR.absin.  This absout segment has its safety switch turned on
temporarily while the job is running, since deleting the absout segment
crashes the absentee job.  To make sure that the absout is printed
after absentee logout, even if it does not reach completion, put the
following command line near the beginning of the absin file:
   eor -dupt [user absout]
where "-dupt" is short for -defer_until_process_termination.

To delete the absout when done, make the following the last line in the
absin file:
   dl [user absout] -force; logout -brief
The logout command prevents an abnormal termination trying to write
another line to the deleted absout file.


An alternative to deleting the absout is to rename it so as to keep
only the latest copy:
   answer yes -brief rename [user absout] ===.old
This command line, which can appear anywhere in the absin file, forces
deletion of any previous .old copy and saves the current absout with
suffix .old for later examination.

To delete the absin when completed, make the following the last line in
the absin file:
   dl [user absin]; logout
The logout command prevents an abnormal termination trying to read
another line from the deleted absin file.


The -truncate argument causes the absout file to be truncated at the
time the absentee job is starting to run, but if the job is being
restarted because of a system crash interruption, the truncation
will not be performed.

When -proxy is given, no attempt is made by ear to validate attribute
dependent control arguments.  Since the job is submitted on behalf of
another user, the attributes for the proxy user will be validated only
by the answering service when it attempts to run the job.  Attribute
dependent control arguments are:
       -no_start_up
       -home_dir
       -authorization
       -process_overseer
       -ring
