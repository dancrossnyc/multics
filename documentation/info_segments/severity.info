02/22/85  severity

Syntax as a command:  severity command_name {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [severity command_name {-control_arg}]


Function: returns a number representing the severity of the most
recent translation or invocation of the specified command.


Arguments:
command_name
   is the name of any command that provides a severity indicator (see
   "Notes on severity indicators").


Control arguments:
-default XX, -dft XX
   specifies the default value XX to be returned if referencing a
   nonexistent or uninitialized severity indicator.


Notes: If the command specified has not defined a severity indicator
or you haven't invoked it yet, an error is indicated unless you give
-default.

The fortran command only supports the severity active function if your
site is using the new FORTRAN compiler as its standard FORTRAN
compiler.


Notes on severity indicators: Severity indicators are set by system
commands, user commands, or from command level by the
set_severity_indicator command.  They are single-precision (one word)
binary values.  The meaning of the value depends on the particular
command.  System commands supporting severity indicators explain their
values under "Severity" in the description of the command.  Under
program control you can define and set severity indicators by assigning
an integer value to an external variable.
