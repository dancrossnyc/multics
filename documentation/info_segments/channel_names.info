The name used to designate an MCS communications channel
is a character string of up to 32 characters. The name is
composed of components separated by periods, where each component
represents a level of multiplexing. the first two components identify
the physical channel on an FNP; further components (if present)
identify the subchannels of a concentrator (such as a VIP 7700 controller).


Format of physical channel name:
The physical channel name (which corresponds to the old-style
name of the from ttyXXX) has the following format:

	F.ANSS

where:
     F		is an FNP identifier (a, b, c, or d)

     A		is an adapter type (h for an HSLA channel,
		l for an LSLA channel)

     N		is the number of the particular adapter
		(0-2 for an HSLA, 0-5 for an LSLA)

     SS		is the decimal number of the subchannel on the
		specified adapter.


Examples:
	Name	Description		Old form

	a.l000	FNP a, LSLA 0, subchannel 0	tty000
	a.h108	FNP a, HSLA 1, subchannel 8	tty708
	b.h016	FNP b, HSLA 0, subchannel 16	ttyG16


Multiplexed channels:
The format of the additional components of the names
of subchannels of a concentrator or "multiplexer" depends on
the particular multiplexer; it may be a station
id, or a sequential number, etc.
For example:
	Name	Description

	b.h016.01	FNP b, HSLA 0, subchannel 16,
		concentrator subchannel 1

	b.h016.09	same physical channel, concentrator
		subchannel 9


ARPANET channels:
The names of ARPANET channels are of the form netXXX for user_telnet
channels or ftpXXX for file-transfer channels, where XXX is an arbitrary
3-digit number.
