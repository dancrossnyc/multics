03/06/80  apl_ioa_ external function

Function:  permits an APL program to do output or formatting using the
ioa_ subroutine.


Usage:
   )DFN IOA APL_IOA_
   )DFN IOA_NNL APL_IOA_$NNL
   )DFN IOA_RS APL_IOA_$RS
   )DFN IOA_RSNNL APL_IOA_$RSNNL
   CONTROL_STRING IOA LIST
   CONTROL_STRING IOA_NNL LIST
   RESULT -< CONTROL_STRING IOA_RS LIST
   RESULT -< CONTROL_STRING IOA_RSNNL LIST


Arguments:
CONTROL_STRING
   is a character scalar or vector that specifies the ioa_ control string.
   Either the circumflex ("136) or APL overbar (^) character may be used
   as the ioa_ control character.

LIST
   is either a single APL value (or expression), or a list of APL values.
   A list of values has the form (VAL1;VAL2;VAL3...), where each value is
   separated from the next by a semicolon, and the entire list is surrounded
   by parentheses.


Notes:
All character arguments are raveled into PL/I character strings, no
matter what the original APL shape.  All numeric arguments are raveled into
a PL/I array of one dimension, no matter what the original APL shape.
