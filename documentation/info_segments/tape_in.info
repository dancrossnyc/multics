03/01/85	tape_in

Syntax as a command:  tape_in path {-control_args}


Function: transfers files from magnetic tape to the
storage system.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the control file that governs the file
   transfer.  If path does not end with the .tcl suffix, it is
   assumed.


Control arguments:
-check, -ck
   specifies that only semantic checking be done on the TCL control
   file.	No tapes are mounted if this option is specified.
-ring
   mounts volumes of the volume-set with write permit rings.
-severityN, -svN
   causes the compiler's error messages with severity less
   than N (where N is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written into the
   "error_output" I/O switch.	The default value for N is 0.


Notes on the tcl source file:
The control file that governs the file transfer is actually a
program, written by the user, in the Tape Control Language (TCL).
the contents of this control file describe the file transfer.  The
same control file can be used with both the tape_in and tape_out
commands.

For additional information on the TCL, type help tcl.gi.
