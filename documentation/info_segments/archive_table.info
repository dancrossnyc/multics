02/21/84  archive_table, act

Syntax:  act archive_path {starnames} {-control_args}


Syntax as active function:
   [act archive_path {starnames} {-control_args}]


Function:  returns the names of specified archive components in a
specified archive segment.  As a command, archive_table prints one
component name per line.  As an active function, it returns names
individually requoted and separated by single spaces.


Arguments:
archive_path
   is the pathname of an archive segment, with or without the archive
   suffix.  The star convention is not allowed.
starnames
   are optional component names to be matched against names of archive
   components.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   causes -name to return archive pathnames, of the form
   ARCHIVE_DIR>ARCHIVE_NAME::COMPONENT_NAME, rather than just the
   component names.
-bit_count, -bc
   returns the bit count of the selected components.
-component_name, -cnm
   causes -name to return only the component name portion of the
   selected components.  It has no effect if -no_name is selected.
   (Default)
-date_time_contents_modified, -dtcm
   returns the date-time-contents-modified of the segment when the
   component was last updated in the archive.


-date_time_updated, -dtud
   returns the date-time when the selected components were last updated
   in the archive.
-header, -he
   prints a header.  Not accepted by the active function.
-mode, -md
   returns the access mode of the selected components.
-name, -nm
   returns the name of the selected components.  (Default)
-no_bit_count, -nbc
   suppresses bit count information.  (Default)
-no_date_time_contents_modified, -ndtcm
   suppresses date-time-contents-modified information.  (Default)
-no_date_time_updated, -ndtud
   suppresses component update time information.  (Default)


-no_header, -nhe
   prints no header.  (Default)
-no_name, -nnm
   suppresses component name information.
-no_requote
   does not requote component attribute groups.
-requote
   requotes the attributes of each component as a single entity.  This
   control argument is ignored by the command.  (Default)


Notes on active function:  If -name is given, archive_table always
requotes the component name (-component_name selected) or archive
pathname (-absolute_pathname selected).

If more than one of -bit_count, -date_time_contents_modified,
-date_time_updated, -mode, and -name is supplied, the selected
attributes are returned, separated by a space.  The order of items is
always:  name, date-time-contents-modified, mode, date-time-updated,
bit count; which is the same order found when using the archive
command's "tl" key.


If -no_requote is used, the selected attributes for each component are
returned separated by spaces.  If more than one component is specified,
successive component attributes are separated by a space.

If -requote is given, the selected attributes for each component are
requoted separated by spaces.  If more than one component is supplied,
then each component's requoted attribute group is separated from the
others by a space.
