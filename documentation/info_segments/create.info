02/08/85  create, cr

Syntax as a command:  cr paths {-control_args}


Function: creates a segment in a specified directory, or in your
working directory; that is, it creates a storage system entry for an
empty segment.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of segments to be created.


Control arguments:
-max_length N, -ml N
   sets the max_length of the created entry to N.  Used with
   -multisegment_file, -max_length sets future MSF components to N
   words long.
-multisegment_file, -msf
   creates an MSF with one empty component, instead of an empty
   segment.  When you foresee that you need much storage, creating an
   MSF prevents the expensive copying occurring when a segment is
   converted to an MSF.


-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies an entryname STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument.
-ring_brackets N1 {N2 {N3}}, -rb N1 {N2 {N3}}
   specifies the desired ring brackets for the created segment.  N3
   defaults to N2, which defaults to N1, which defaults to your
   validation level.


Access required: You must have m access to a directory to create the
segment, and you are given rw to it.


Notes: If there is a one-name segment with an identical name to the
segment you are creating, you are asked whether to delete the old
segment.  If it has multiple names, the conflicting one is removed and
a message is issued to you.  In either case, since the directory is
being changed, you must also have modify permission for the directory.

All directories specified in paths must already exist; that is, only a
single level of the storage system hierarchy can be created with this
command.

See the create_dir and link commands for the creation of directories
and links.
