08/12/83  repeat_query, rq

Syntax:  rq


Function:  repeats the last query (by command_query_, described in the
Subroutines and I/O Modules manual) if it has not yet been answered.


Notes:  The repeat_query command is useful for reinterpreting questions
(asked by other commands) that are garbled.

If no question has been asked, or if the latest question was answered,
the error message "No pending query." is printed.

This command does not completely restore the environment in effect at
the time of the original query.  For example, nonstandard attachments
of I/O switches are not restored.
