:Entry: find_condition_frame_: 02/01/83  find_condition_frame_


Function: returns a pointer to the most recent condition frame,
or the most recent one before a specified frame.


Syntax:
dcl find_condition_frame_ entry (ptr) returns (ptr);
stack_ptr = find_condition_frame_ (start_ptr);


Arguments:
start_ptr
   is a pointer to a stack frame.  The most recent condition frame
   before this stack frame is returned.  The start_ptr argument can be
   obtained by another call to find_condition_frame_.  If start_ptr is
   null, the most recent condition frame is returned.  (Input)
stack_ptr
   is a pointer to the desired condition frame.  (Output)

Notes:
The condition history can be traced by repeated calls to
find_condition_frame_, starting with a null start_ptr argument and
repeatedly passing the output stack_ptr as input.
