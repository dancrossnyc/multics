08/23/90  Kermit modes

The following list of modes are recognized by the kermit file transfer
protocol, and the kermit requests: set and show.   The values
associated with each mode are also given.


List of modes affecting file storage:
file_type STR
   indicates the type of file being transferred.  STR may be one of
   "binary" or "ascii".
file_warning STR
   indicates the action to be taken when an incoming file name has
   the same name as an existing file name in the default directory
   when receiving files.  STR may be one of "on" or "off".  If
   file_warning is on, kermit will rename the file to avoid
   overwriting the pre-existing one.  If file_warning is off the
   incoming file will replace the pre-existing one.  If logging
   transactions, the log will indicate the name of the file in which
   the data was stored.  Default is on.



incomplete STR
   indicates the action to be taken if a file was not completely
   transferred.  STR may be one of "keep" or "discard".  If keep is
   specified, all incomplete files are saved.  If discard is
   specified, incomplete files will be discarded.  (Default is
   keep.)


List of modes affecting file transfer:
control_prefix CHR, cp CHR
   the character to use for quoting of control characters, where CHR
   is any character in the range "!" through ">" or "`" through "~",
   but different from the eight_bit_prefix and repeat_prefix.
   (Default is #)


eight_bit_prefix CHR, ebp CHR
   the ascii character Multics-Kermit will use to quote characters
   which have the 8th bit set, when transmitting binary files via a
   7-bit connection.  CHR is one of the following, but
   different from the control_prefix and repeat_prefix:

   Y characters with the 8th bit set will be quoted if the remote
     Kermit requests it.

   N Characters with the 8th bit set will not be quoted.


   & or any character in the range "!" through ">" or "`" through
     "~".  Use the specified character for quoting characters with the
     8th bit set.  If the Multics-Kermit eight_bit_prefix character is
     different from the remote kermit's, then no 8th bit prefixing
     will be done.

   The value of this mode is ignored if line_byte_size is 8.
   (Default is &)


end_of_packet CHR, eop CHR
   the character Multics-Kermit will use as a line terminator for
   incoming packets, where CHR is an ascii character between SOH (001
   octal) and US (037 octal) inclusive, and different from the
   start_of_packet character.  (Default is carriage return,
   015 octal)


line_byte_size N
   indicates whether data is being transmitted via a 7-bit or 8-bit
   connection, where N may be one of 7 or 8.
   A 7-bit connection is desirable when transferring ascii
   files, or when the 8th bit of each transmitted byte is
   required for parity or changed by intervening communications
   equipment.  An 8-bit connection should be used for transferring
   binary files as it decreases protocol overhead.  If an 8-bit
   connection cannot be used for a binary file transfer, then a 7-bit
   connection with the eight_bit_prefix mode enabled may be used to
   transfer binary files (See above).  (Default is 7)

packet_length N, pl N
   maximum packet length Multics-Kermit will receive, where N is an
   integer between 20 and 94 (decimal).  (Default is 80)


   NOTE: Long packets can be selected when the user has explicitly
   selected N which is larger than 94 with a SET command.  The maximum
   length of long packets can be up to 1500 characters.

parity STR
   used for communicating with systems or networks that require the
   8th bit for character parity.  The parity used must be the same
   for both the local and remote kermit.  STR may be one of:

          "none"    eight data bits and no parity.
          "mark"    seven data bits with the parity bit set to
                    one.
          "space"   seven data bits with the parity bit set to
                    zero.


          "even"    seven data bits with the parity bit set to
                    make the overall parity even.
          "odd"     seven data bits with the parity bit set to
                    one to make the overall parity odd.

   The value of the mode is ignored if line_byte_size is 8.
   (Default is none)


repeat_prefix CHR, rp CHR
   the character Multics-Kermit will use to indicate a repeated
   character, where CHR may be any character in the range "!" through
   ">" or "`" through "~", but different from the control_prefix and
   eight_bit_prefix.  Space " " denotes no repeat count processing is
   to be done.  If the Multics-Kermit repeat_prefix character is
   different from the remote kermit's, then no repeat prefixing will
   be done.  (Default is "~").
retry_threshold N, rt N
   how many times to try sending or receiving a particular packet
   before giving up, where N is an integer between 5 and 15
   inclusive.  (Default is 5)


start_of_packet CHR, sop CHR
   the character to be used for the start of packet, where
   CHR is an ascii character between NUL (000 octal) and US (037
   octal) inclusive.  The start_of_packet character must be the same
   for both the local and remote kermit, but different from the
   end_of_packet character.  (Default is SOH, octal 001)
timeout N
   how many seconds Multics-Kermit wants the remote Kermit to wait
   for a packet from Multics before trying again, where N is an
   integer value between 5 and 20.  (Default is 15)
