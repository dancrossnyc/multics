Syntax:  .ifi fig "figure-title"


Function:
This compose macro
1) increments the figure counter
2) outputs a centered, perhaps multiline figure caption below the
   figure with appropriate spacing between figure and caption
3) adds the 'figure-title' to the list of Illustrations in the Table of
   Contents if the creation of such a list has been enabled (see
   fig_on.info)


Arguments:
'figure-title' is the title of the figure, as it is to appear in the
   list of Illustrations in the Table of Contents (initial caps, no
   underlines).


Notes:
1) The figure counter is maintained on a per-section basis for
   documents done in sections (those in which the 'section' variable
   has been set), and on a per-document basis for all other documents.
2) After the fig macro is used, the 'figure' compose variable contains
   the figure number of the current figure.  'figure' will be of the
   form '<section>-N' if the 'section' variable has been set.  'figure'
   can be used in the text to refer to the current figure.	(See
   fig_get_no.info for references to a figure other than the current
   figure.)
3) See fig_index.info, fig_on.info, and fig_get_no.info for related
   information.


Examples:
If the first use of the fig macro in an unsectioned document is
     .ifi fig "Figure Title"
the result is

		    Figure 1.  Figure Title

If the fourth use of the fig macro in Section 3 of a document is
     .ifi fig "First Part of	Figure Title!Second Part of Figure Title"
the result is

	      Figure 3-4.  First Part of Figure Title
		  Second Part of Figure Title
