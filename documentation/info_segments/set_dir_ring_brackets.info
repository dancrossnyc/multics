08/22/83  set_dir_ring_brackets, sdrb

Syntax:  sdrb path {rb1 {rb2}}


Function:  allows a user to modify the ring brackets of a specified
directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the directory whose ring
   brackets are to be modified.
rb1, rb2
   are the numbers that represent the directory ring brackets:  rb1 is
   the number to be used for the first ring bracket of the directory,
   and rb2 is the one to be used for the second.  The ring brackets
   must be in the allowable range v through 7 (where v depends on the
   user's current validation level) and must have the ordering:

         rb1<=rb2

   If rb1 and rb2 are omitted, they are set to the user's current
   validation level.  If rb1 is omitted, rb2 cannot be given and rb1
   and rb2 are set to the user's current validation level.


Notes:  The user's process must have a validation level less than or
equal to rb1.  See the Programmer's Reference Manual (AG93) for a
discussion of ring brackets and validation levels.
