Function: returns a string whose content is entirely controlled by

time_format
   an ioa_-like control string describing the desired result in terms
   of literal characters and/or date/time selectors
   (see time_format.gi).
time_string
   indicates the date about which information is desired.  If you
   supply no time_string, the current date is used.  The time string is
   concatenated to form a single argument even if it contains spaces;
   you need not quote it.  (See time_strings.gi.)


Control arguments:
-language STR, -lang STR
   STR specifies the language in which month names, day names, and zone
   names are to be expressed.  (Default: the process default)
-zone STR
   STR specifies the zone to be used to express the result.  (Default:
   the process default)


Notes: Use the print_time_defaults command to display the default
language and zone.  Use the display_time_info command to display a list
of all acceptable language and zone values.
