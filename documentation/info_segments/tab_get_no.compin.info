Syntax:  .ifi tab_get_no n


Function:
This compose macro generates the number of a table other than the
current table.


Arguments:
'n' is an integer; the number of the nth table relative to the current
   table.


Notes:
1) The number of the nth table relative to the current table (e.g., -1
   = first preceding, 2 = second following) is calculated and set into
   the 'table' compose variable.  The form of the number is the same as
   that generated by the tab macro (see tab.info.)  'table' is used to
   refer to the desired table.
2) See tab.info, tab_on.info, and tab_index.info for related
   information.


Examples:
The following lines reference the next three tables that will appear in
the text of an unsectioned document.

     .ifi tab_get_no 1
     .ur Table %table%,
     .ifi tab_get_no 2
     .ur Table %table%, and
     .ifi tab_get_no 3
     .ur Table %table% below illustrate these results.

Table 1, Table 2, and Table 3 below illustrate these results.


The following lines reference the two tables that have just appeared in
the text of Section 4 of a document.

     .ifi tab_get_no -1
     .ur See Table %table%,
     .ifi tab_get_no 0
     .ur Table %table% above.

See Table 4-1 and Table 4-2 above.
