Syntax for attach description:
     record_stream_ {switch_name} {-control_args}


Function: The record_stream_ I/O module attaches an I/O switch to a
target I/O switch so that record I/O operations on the attached switch
are translated into stream I/O operations on the target switch, or so
that stream I/O operations on the attached switch are translated into
record I/O operations on the target switch.  In this way a program
that uses only record I/O may process unstructured files and do I/O
from/to the terminal.  Similarly, a program that uses only stream I/O
can process some structured files.

Entry points in this module are not called directly by users; rather
the module is accessed through the I/O system.


Arguments:
switch_name
   is the name of the target I/O switch.  It need not be attached when
   this attachment is made.  If this argument is omitted, the -target
   control argument must be present.


Control arguments:
   The following control the transformation of records into a stream of
   bytes and vice versa, or control the target attachment.
-nnl
   transforms a record into a stream without appending a newline
   character.
-length N
   converts the stream of bytes to a sequence of records each of which
   has length N.
-target attach_descrip
   specifies the attachment of a uniquely named target switch.  This
   control argument must occur if and only if the switch_name argument
   is omitted, and it must be the last control argument in the attach
   description, if present.


Notes: If neither the -nnl nor -length control arguments are given,
lines are transformed into records after deleting trailing newlines
and records are transformed into lines by appending newlines.


List of opening modes:
stream_input
   The target I/O switch must be either open for sequential_input, open
   for sequential_input_output, or attached and closed.  In the last
   case, it is opened for sequential_input.  The sequence of records
   read from the target switch is transformed into a stream of bytes
   that are transmitted to the calling program by the get_line and
   get_chars operations.  The read_record operation is used to read the
   records from the target switch.


stream_output
   The target I/O switch must be either open for sequential_output,
   open for sequential_input_output, or attached and closed.  In the
   last case, it is opened for sequential_output.  The stream of bytes
   written to the attached switch by the put_chars operation is
   transformed into a sequence of records that are written to the
   target switch by use of the write_record operation.


sequential_input
   The target I/O switch must be either open for stream_input, open for
   stream_input_output, or attached and closed.  In the last case, it
   is opened for stream_input.  The stream of bytes read from the
   target switch is transformed into a sequence of records that are
   transmitted to the calling program by read_record operations.  If
   the attach description specifies the default line to record
   transformation, the get_line operation is used to read bytes from
   the target switch.  If the attach description specifies the -length
   control argument, the get_chars operation is used to read bytes from
   the target switch.


sequential_output
   The target I/O switch must be either open for stream_output, open
   for stream_input_output, or attached and closed.  In the last case,
   it is opened for stream_output.  The sequence of bytes written to
   the attached switch by the write_record operation is transformed
   into a stream of bytes that are written to the target switch by use
   of the put_chars operation.


Notes on transformations: The transformation from record to stream
form can be described in terms of taking records from a record switch
and giving bytes to a stream switch, and similarly for stream to
record (a record is a string of bytes).  Which switch is the record
switch and which the stream switch depends on the opening mode.  The
details are as follows:

Record to stream
     (default)    A record is taken from the record switch, a newline
                  character is appended, and the resulting string is
                  given to the stream switch.

     -nnl         A record is taken from the record switch and given to
                  the stream switch without modification.


Stream to record
     (default)    A line (string of bytes ending with a newline
                  character) is taken from the stream switch, the
                  newline character is deleted, and the resulting
                  string is given to the record switch.

     -length N    To form a record, N bytes are taken from the stream
                  switch and given to the record switch as one record.


Notes on buffering: The I/O module may hold data in buffers between
operations when the switch is opened for stream_output, stream_input,
or sequential_input.


Close operation:  The I/O module closes the target switch if and only
if the I/O module opened it.


Detach operation:  The I/O module detaches the target switch if and
only if the I/O module attached it via the -target control argument.


Position operation:  Only positioning to the beginning of file or end
of file and skipping forward are supported, except in the default
sequential case, which also permits backward skipping.  These
operations are only supported to the extent the attachment of the
target I/O switch supports them.


Control and modes operations:  These are supported for open switches in
the sense that they are passed along to the I/O module for the target
switch.


Notes on I/O status:  In addition to the I/O status codes specified in
the description of the iox_ subroutine for the various I/O operations,
this I/O module returns codes returned by the target switch I/O module.
