08/19/88 list_abs_requests, lar

Syntax as a command:  lar {path} {-control_args}


Function:	 lists requests in the absentee queues.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a request to be listed.  The star convention is
   allowed.  Only requests matching this pathname are selected.  If the
   path argument is not specified, all pathnames are selected.  Also
   see the -entry control argument below.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the full pathname of each selected request, rather than just
   the entryname.
-admin {User_id}, -am {User_id}
   selects the requests of all users, or of the user specified by
   User_id.  If the -admin control argument is not specified, only the
   user's own requests are selected.  See "Notes" below.
-all, -a
   searches the foreground and all priority queues and prints the
   totals for each non-empty queue whether or not any requests are
   selected from it.  If the -all control argument is not specified,
   nothing is printed for queues from which no requests are selected.
   This control argument is incompatible with the -queue control
   argument.


-brief, -bf
   prevents the printing of the state and the comment of the request.
   If the -brief control argument is not specified, these items are
   printed.  This control argument is incompatible with the -long and
   -total control arguments.
-deferred_indefinitely, -dfi
   selects only requests that are deferred indefinitely.  Such requests
   are not run until the operator releases them.
-entry STR, -et STR
   selects only requests whose entrynames match STR.  The star
   convention is allowed.  Directory portions of request pathnames are
   ignored when selecting requests.  This control argument is
   incompatible with the path argument.


-foreground, -fg
   searches only the foreground queue, and prints the totals for this
   queue, whether or not any requests are selected from it.  Also, see
   the -queue control argument.
-id ID
   selects only requests whose identifier matches the specified ID.


-immediate, -im
   selects only requests that can be run immediately upon reaching the
   heads of their respective queues.  This does not include requests
   deferred indefinitely, requests deferred until a specific time, or
   requests that have reached the head of the queue and have been
   deferred by the system because their CPU time limits are higher
   than the maximum for the current shift.  It does include requests
   deferred because of load control or resource unavailability,
   because those conditions could change at any time.  Also, see the
   -position control argument.


-long, -lg
   prints all of the information pertaining to an absentee request
   including the long request identifier and the full pathname.  If
   this control argument is omitted, only the short request identifier,
   entryname, state and comment, if present, are printed.  The -long,
   -brief, and -total control arguments are incompatible.
-long_id, -lgid
   prints the long form of the request identifier.  If this or the
   -long control argument is not specified, the short form of the
   request identifier is printed.
-pathname, -pn
   prints the full pathname of each selected request, rather than just
   the entryname, just as -absolute_pathname does.


-position, -psn
   prints the position within its queue of each selected request.  When
   used with the -total control argument, it prints a list of all the
   positions of the selected requests.	When used with the -immediate
   control argument, it considers only immediate requests when
   computing positions.  See "Notes" below.
-queue N, -q N
   searches only queue N, and prints the totals for that queue, whether
   or not any requests are selected from it.  If the -queue control
   argument is not specified, all queues are searched but nothing is
   printed for queues from which no requests are selected.	For
   convenience in writing exec_coms and abbreviations, the word
   "foreground" or "fg" following the -queue control argument performs
   the same function as the -foreground control argument.  This control
   argument is incompatible with the -all control argument.


-resource {STR}, -rsc {STR}
   selects only requests having a resource requirement.  If STR is
   specified, only requests whose resource descriptions contain that
   string are selected.  This control argument also causes the resource
   descriptions of the selected requests to be printed, even when the
   -long control argument is not specified.  Type "help
   reserve_resource" for a description of the syntax of STR.
-sender STR
   specifies that only requests from sender STR should be listed.  One
   or more request identifiers must also be specified.  In most cases,
   the sender is an RJE station identifier.


-total, -tt
   prints only the total number of selected requests and the total
   number of requests in the queue plus a list of positions if the
   -position control argument is also specified.	If the queue is
   empty, it is not listed.  This control argument is incompatible with
   the -long and -brief control arguments.
-user User_id
   selects only requests entered by the specified user.  See "Notes"
   below.


Access required:  The user must have o access to the queue(s) to invoke
lar.  The user must have r extended access to the queue(s), in order to
use the -admin, -position, or -user control arguments, since it is
necessary to read all requests in the queue(s) in order to select those
entered by a specified user or to compute the positions of the selected
requests.


Notes:  All queues are searched for the user's requests; the request
identification, entryname, state, and comment, if present, of each
request is printed.  If no arguments are specified, only the user's own
requests are selected for listing.  Nothing is printed for queues from
which no requests are selected.


The entry name specified after the -entry control argument, the entry
portion of the pathname argument, and the RJE station name specified
after the -sender control argument, may each be starnames.


The User_id arguments specified after the -admin or -user may have any
of the following forms:

    Person_id.Project_id   matches that user only
    Person_id.*	       matches that person on any project
    Person_id	       same as Person_id.*
    *.Project_id	       matches any user on that project
    .Project_id	       same as *.Project_id
    *.*		       same as -admin with no User_id following it

If -admin User_id or -user User_id is given more than once in a
command, only the final instance is used.  When a user name is
specified, with either the -admin or -user control arguments, then
proxy requests are selected if either the user who entered the request,
or the proxy user on whose behalf it was entered, matches the specified
user name.
