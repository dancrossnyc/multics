08/01/84  gcos_label_tape, gclt

Syntax as a command:  gclt reel_num {new_num} {-control_args}


Function:  The gcos_label_tape command writes a GCOS label on a tape.


Arguments:
reel_num
   is the number on the label of the tape reel to be used.
new_num
   is the new serial number to be written on the tape.  If it is the
   same as the reel_num, it may be omitted.


Control arguments:
-density N, -den N
   where N specifies the tape density.  (Default is 1600 bpi)
-erase
   erases the tape before labeling it.  Default is to overwrite the old
   label (if it exists), and leave the remaining data intact.
-no_erase
   does not erase the tape before labeling it.  (Default)
-track N, -tk N:  where N specifies 7- or 9-track tape.  (Default is
   9-track)


Notes:  If no control arguments are given, the command:
     gclt xyz12
is equivalent to the command:
     gclt xyz12 xyz12 -tk 9 -den 1600 -no_erase
If conflicting control arguments are given, the rightmost control
argument is used (e.g., "gclt m1266 -tk 7 -tk 9" results in a 9-track
tape label.)
