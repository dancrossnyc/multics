Syntax:  display_cdt {channel} {-control_args}


Function:  enables a qualified user to display the contents of a
channel definition table (CDT).


Arguments:
channel
   is the name of the communications channel for which the CDT entry is
   to be displayed.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   displays names and CDT indices for all channels in the CDT.
-brief, -bf
   displays only channel names and CDT indices (without channel or FNP
   details).  This is the default for the -all and -subtree control
   arguments.
-cmf path
   creates a CMF in the segment named path in a form suitable to
   cv_cmf, based on the contents of the CDT.
-header, -he
   displays the CDT header variables in addition to other requested
   information.


-long, -lg
   displays detailed information for the specified channel or FNP.
   This is the default unless -all or -subtree is specified, in which
   case -brief is the default.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses display of the CDT header variables.  This is the
   default.
-pathname path, -pn path
   displays the CDT whose pathname is path.  By default, the CDT in the
   segment >sc1>cdt is displayed.
-subtree
   displays the names and CDT indices for all subchannels (if any) of
   the specified channel.


Notes:  If display_cdt is specified with no channel name and no control
arguments, a usage error notification is returned.  Specifying channel
name only, with no control arguments, results in a -long display.

The display_cdt command enables the user to check for inconsistencies
in a CDT before unnecessarily undertaking corrective action.

The user must have r access to the CDT to invoke the display_cdt
command.
