08/07/86  where_doc, wdoc

Syntax as a command:  wdoc topic_name {-control_args}


Function: returns the names of manuals that contain information about
the specified topic name.


Arguments:
topic_name
   is the name of a topic, command, subroutine, or I/O module.  Use
   iteration to get more than one topic.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints all the sections of manual information.
-allow_partial_matches, -apm
   searches for a partial match of the topic name if an exact match is
   not found.
-audience, -aud
   describes the audience for which the manual is intended.
-database_pathname PATH, -dbpn PATH
   specifies the pathname of the data base you want instead of the
   default one.  Once you supply -database_pathname, the specified data
   base is used for all subsequent invocations of where_doc during your
   process until you select another data base.


-description, -desc
   returns a brief description of the manual's contents.
   (Default)
-dont_allow_partial_matches, -dapm
   does not allow partial matches.  (Default)
-new_features, -nf
   lists all new features that have been added to the manual with the
   last update (revision or addendum).
-no_audience, -no_aud
   does not describe the manual's intended audience.  (Default)
-no_description, -no_desc
   suppresses printing of the brief description of the manual's
   contents.
-no_new_features, -no_nf
   does not list new features.  (Default)


-no_table_of_contents, -no_toc
   does not print the manual's table of contents.  (Default)
-output_file PATH, -of PATH
   directs the output to a file instead of to your terminal.
-table_of_contents, -toc
   prints the manual's table of contents.


Notes: If you can't find a match for topic_name and didn't select
-allow_partial_matches or -dont_allow_partial_matches, you are asked
whether or not you want where_doc to search for partial matches.

When you use a control argument giving additional information about the
manuals found (e.g., -audience or -table_of_contents) and where_doc
finds more than one manual with information about the topic_name, a
menu containing the names of the manuals is displayed.  You can then
choose to see the information on one or more of the manuals listed or
return to command level.
