06/17/82  backup_cleanup, bc

Syntax:  bc {starnames} {-control_args}


Function: deletes and optionally dprints backup maps and error files.
Copies error files into >udd>SysDaemon>error_file.  This command is
useful when a backup run has been interrupted.


Arguments:
starnames
   specify the pathnames of particular maps and error files to be 
   processed.  Given the starname PATH, all segments matching PATH.map
   and PATH.ef are (dprinted and) deleted. If no starnames are 
   specified, all segments in the working directory matching *.*.map
   or *.*.*.ef are processed.


Control arguments:
-dprint, -dp
   causes maps to be dprinted to "SysDaemon/OLD MAP" and error files to
   be dprinted to "SysDaemon/OLD ERROR FILE". This is the default.
-no_dprint, -ndp
   suppresses dprints and causes the segments processed to be deleted.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies queue number N for dprints. The default is queue 1.


Notes: Control arguments to backup_cleanup, unlike control arguments
to other backup commands, affect only the command invocation and do
not set static switches that affect later backup command invocations.


Example:

   bc >udd>Carry>reload.**

causes all segments in >udd>Carry whose names match reload.**.map or
reload.**.ef to be dprinted and deleted.
