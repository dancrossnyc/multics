07/24/84  use_symbols, usb

Syntax as a command:  usb path


Function:  The use_symbols command sets the current symbol dictionary.
All Speedtype commands then use this symbol dictionary.  If this symbol
dictionary does not exist, the user is asked if it should be created.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the symbol dictionary that is to be the new
   current symbol dictionary.  If path does not have a suffix of
   symbols, one is assumed; however, symbols must be the last component
   of the symbols dictionary segment name.


Notes:  If other Speedtype commands are issued in a user's process
before the use_symbols command, then those commands use the default
symbol dictionary in the user's home directory.  The default symbol
dictionary has the pathname:

    >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.symbols
