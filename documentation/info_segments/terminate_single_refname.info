07/25/86  terminate_single_refname, tmsr

Syntax as a command:  tmsr ref_names


Function: removes a file or a single reference name from your
address space and resets links to the terminated segment or MSF.
It is commonly used prior to initiating a different version of
a program.


Arguments:
ref_names
   are the reference names of segments or MSFs to be terminated.


Control arguments:
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies reference name STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument.


Notes: This command terminates a single reference name.  Unless the
specified reference name is the only one by which the segment or MSF
is known, the file itself is not terminated.

Be careful not to unintentionally terminate a segment of the command
language interpreter or another critical piece of the environment.
Fatal process errors usually result from such an action.

The star convention is not recognized.

If the reference name is on a component of an object MSF, links to any
of the components are unsnapped, and if it is the only name on the MSF,
all of the components are terminated.
