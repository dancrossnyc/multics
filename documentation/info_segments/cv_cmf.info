Syntax:  cv_cmf cmf_path {-control_args}


Function:  converts an ASCII channel master file (CMF) into a binary
channel definition table (CDT).  The binary table can be installed
using the install command.


Arguments:
cmf_path
   is the pathname of the channel master file.  If path does not have a
   suffix of cmf, one is assumed.  However, the suffix cmf must be the
   last component of the name of the source segment.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   uses short form of error messages.
-long, -lg
   uses long form of error messages.
-severity N, -sv N
   causes error messages whose severity is less than N (where N is 0,
   1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written to the user_output switch.  If this
   control argument is not specified, a severity level of 0 is assumed
   (i.e., all error messages are written to the user_output switch).


Notes:  If no control arguments are given, each error message is
printed in long form the first time it occurs and in short form
thereafter.

The converted channel master file is given a name corresponding to the
entryname of the source segment, with the cmf suffix replaced by cdt.
It is placed in the working directory.


List of severity values:  The cv_cmf command associates the following
severity values to be used by the severity active function:

Value     Meaning
  0       No compilation yet or no error.
