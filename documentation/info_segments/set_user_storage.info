02/22/85  set_user_storage

Syntax as a command:  set_user_storage {virtual_pointer} {-control_arg}


Function: establishes an area as the storage region in which normal
user allocations are performed.  These allocations include FORTRAN
common blocks and PL/I external variables whose names do not contain
dollar signs.


Arguments:
virtual_pointer
   is a virtual pointer to an initialized area (see
   virtual_pointers.gi).


Control arguments:
-create
   creates (and initializes) a system-free segment in your process
   directory.
-system
   specifies the area used for linkage sections.


Notes:  The control arguments must be given only if virtual_ptr is not
specified and vice versa.

To initialize or create an area, refer to the description of the
create_area command.  The area must be set up as either zero_on_free or
zero_on_alloc.  It is recommended that the area specified be
extensible.
