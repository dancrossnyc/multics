10/20/86  make_list, mkls


Syntax as a command:  mkls path -control_args


Function:  creates a nonprintable empty lister file upon which document
processing is performed.  (Also see the description of the create_list
command, which creates a lister file using an ASCII input file.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file to be made.  Lister must be the
   last component of the lister file name; however, if path does not
   have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-delimiter rf, -dm rf
   sets the record delimiter used in the lister file to r, and the
   field delimiter used in the lister file to f.  Both r and f must be
   exactly one character long and be chosen from:

        ! # $ % & * = ? @ ^ | ~

   and each must be a different character.  If this control argument is
   omitted, the record delimiter, by default, is the dollar character
   ($), and the field delimiter, by default, is the equal character
   (=).
-field_name name1 ...  nameN, -fn name1 ...  nameN
   sets the names of the fields in the created lister file to name1
   through nameN.  Each name must begin with an alphabetic character
   and consist of alphanumeric characters.  No two names can be the
   same.  This control argument is required.


Notes:  The make_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the lister file is not created or the
invocation of make_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 0 is set
when the lister file is successfully created.
