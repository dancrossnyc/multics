01/27/84  reconnect_ec_disable

Syntax:  reconnect_ec_disable


Function:  suppresses any attempt to find or invoke the reconnect.ec
segment upon reconnection to a disconnected process.


Notes:  The reconnect_ec_disable command reverses the effect of the
reconnect_ec_enable command, which is the default setting when the
standard process overseer procedure process_overseer_ is used.  See
Section 7 of the MAM -- Project Administrator Manual, Order No.  AK51
for a discussion of process overseers and their use.
