02/17/89  Significant changes in Emacs 12.9 for MR12.3

1.  f (rmail-forward) to forward the current message to an address
    (list) that will be prompted for.  A numeric argument will allow
    the user to enter redistribution comments via a comments buffer.

2.  x (rmail-toggle-seen) to toggle the seen switch on the current
    message.  This switch is displayed to the user as the minor mode
    "Seen" and will be turned on immediately a message is brought into
    the RMAIL buffer to be displayed.

3.  ?  (rmail-help) to display brief information about each of the
    RMAIL mode (additionally the reply and comment buffers) requests
    that are available.

4.  q (rmail-quit) is being modified to only question a user quitting
    when no rmail commands have been entered between the arrival of
    new mail and requesting of rmail-quit.
