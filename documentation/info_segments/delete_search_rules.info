02/07/84  delete_search_rules, dsr

Syntax:  dsr paths


Function: deletes search rules for object segments.


Arguments:
paths
   are usually directory pathnames (relative or absolute) to be deleted
   from the current search rules.  One of the paths can be the keyword
   working_dir.


Notes: Site-defined keywords and home_dir and process_dir are not
accepted by delete_search_rules although they are accepted by
add_search_rules.  Deletion of the initiated_segments and
referencing_dir keywords is discouraged and may lead to unpredictable
results.

See the add_search_rules, print_search_rules, and set_search_rules
info segments.  The standard search rules are described in Section 4
under "Search Rules" in the Programmer's Reference Manual (AG91).
