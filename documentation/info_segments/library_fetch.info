02/10/86  library_fetch, lf

Syntax as a command:  lf {search_names} {-control_args}


Function: fetches entries from a library.  It functionally replaces
get_library_segment.  You can fetch segments, archives, archive
components, multisegment files (MSFs), and MSF components.


Arguments:
search_names
   are star names identifying the library entries to be fetched.
   Defaults differ for each library descriptor.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   includes in the output file complete status information for fetched
   entries.
-all_matches, -amch
   fetches all matching entries.  (Default, if you supply more than one
   search name, any star names, or -components)
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of information about fetched entries.  (Default)
-chase
   fetches through links.
-components, -comp
   fetches library entries contained in, or with, a matching entry; it
   implies -all_matches.


-container, -cont
   fetches the library entry containing a matching library entry,
   rather than the matching entry itself.
-default, -dft
   includes in the output file default status information for fetched
   entries.
-entry, -et
   fetches matching library entries only.  (Default)
-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   specifies the descriptor defining the libraries to be searched.
-first_match, -fmch
   fetches the first matching entry only.  (Default, if you specify
   only one search name)


-into path
   fetches library entries into the specified pathname (absolute or
   relative).  The directory portion of the pathname identifies the
   directory into which each library entry is copied; the final
   entryname of the pathname renames each library entryname being
   placed on the copy.  You can give an equal name as the final
   entryname of the path.  Use -into only once in a command line.  If
   not given, matching entries are copied into your working directory
   and no renaming occurs.
-library library_name, -lb library_name
   fetches entries in the specified library.  You can use star names.
   You can supply up to 100 -library control arguments; if you give
   none, any default library names specified in the library descriptor
   are used.


-long, -lg
   prints information about fetched entries.
-match
   puts entrynames that match a search name on the fetched entry.
   (Default)
-name, -nm
   puts all the entrynames on the fetched library entry.
-no_chase
   does not fetch through links.  (Default)
-omit
   does not fetch library entries awaiting deletion.  (Default)
-output_file filename, -of filename
   appends status of fetched library entries to named file.


-primary, -pri
   puts first entryname on fetched library entry.
-retain, -ret
   fetches library entries awaiting deletion.
-search_name search_name
   gives search_name that looks like a control argument.  You can
   supply one or more -search_name control arguments.


Notes: You can give any combination of the control arguments governing
naming (-name, -primary, and -match).  However, select only one from
each group of the following: -chase or -no_chase; -long or -brief;
-container, -components, or -entry; -retain or -omit; and -all or
-default.

You must use -output_file if you give -all or -default.
