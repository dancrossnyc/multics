02/11/85  defer_messages, dm

Syntax as a command:  dm {mbx_specification}


Function: suspends printing of messages.


Arguments:
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox on which messages are to be accepted.  If not
   given, the user's default mailbox (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx)
   is used.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to
      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.


-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.


Notes: Deferred messages stay in your mailbox until you issue
print_messages.  The immediate_messages command restores printing of
messages as you get them.

For a description of the mailbox see accept_messages and print_mail.
