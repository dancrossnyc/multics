07/30/86  Archive Pathname Convention (general information)

The Archive Pathname Convention is a method used by many commands to
specify a component of an archive.  This permits the command to access
the contents of the archive component rather than the whole archive,
without first extracting the component from the archive.  The component
is specified as part of a pathname, and is signalled by the presence of
the archive pathname delimiter, double colon ("::").  Multiple archives
or components of archives may be specified by also using the star and
equal conventions.


An archive component pathname is a pathname containing a double colon
("::") separating the pathname of the archive segment, on the left,
from the name of the archive component, on the right.  The ".archive"
suffix preceding the double colon is assumed and need not be given
explicitly.

Commands should either support or reject archive pathnames.  Many
commands accept archive pathnames for input files, but in general,
archive pathnames are not permitted for output files.  Only commands
which specifically manipulate archives can modify archives.


Notes: See archive.info for a description of the archive command, which
is used to create and maintain archives.  See starname.gi.info for
information about the star convention.  See equalname.gi.info for
information on the equal convention.  For more information on
pathnames, see pathname.gi.info.  For information on manipulating
archive pathnames, see pathname_manipulation_af.gi.info.
