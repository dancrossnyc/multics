02/27/85  truncate, tc

Syntax as a command:  tc {-control_arg} path {length}
                 or:  tc segno {length}


Function: truncates a segment to an optionally specified length and
resets the bit count accordingly, setting the bit count author to be
the user who invoked the command.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment.  You can't use the star convention.
length
   is an octal integer indicating the length of the segment in words
   after truncation.  If you don't provide length, zero is assumed.
segno
   is an octal segment number.


Control arguments:
-name, -nm
   specifies that the octal number following it is a pathname.


Access required: You need write access on the segment to be truncated.


Notes: If the segment is already shorter than the specified length,
its length is unchanged, but the bit count is set to the length given.

Don't use truncate on segments that are, or are components of,
structured files.

If you use truncate on a consistent MSF, it is operated on as in a
single segment.  If the truncation length is less than the current
length, components are deleted until the sum of the bit counts of all
the components is equal to the truncation length; if the truncation
length is greater than that sum, components are created as needed.
