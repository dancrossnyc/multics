Syntax as a command:  display_dut {source_name} {-control_args}


Function: allows system administrators to display the Daemon User
Table (DUT), which contains information about daemon users.  The
Daemon User Table resides in >sc1>daemon_user_table.


Arguments:
source_name
   is the message coordinator source name associated with the daemon
   process whose Daemon User Table entry is to be displayed (e.g.,
   cord, prta, vinc, and vcomp).  A starname may be given to identify
   several daemons.


Control arguments:
-active
   displays entries in Daemon User Table for all daemon processes that
   currently exist (this is the default).
-all, -a
   displays all table entries.
-lock
   displays entries in Daemon User Table that are locked.
-name Person_id, -nm Person_id
   displays entry or entries associated with the given Person_id.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses display of the heading information contained at the
   beginning of the Daemon User Table.  The default is to display the
   heading.


-octal, -oc
   displays header and entries in an octal dump, as well as in
   interpretive format.
-pathname path, -pn path
   gives the pathname of the table to be displayed.  If omitted, the
   system Daemon User Table in >sc1>daemon_user_table is used.


Notes:  The -all, -active, -lock, and -name control arguments and the
source_name argument select entries to be displayed.  If more than one
is given, an entry is displayed if it matches any of the conditions
specified by the arguments.  If none are given, entries for active
daemon processes are displayed.
