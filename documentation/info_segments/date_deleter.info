02/08/85  date_deleter

Syntax as a command:
   date_deleter dir_path cutoff {star_names} {-control_args}


Function: deletes segments and multisegment files (MSFs) older than a
specified number of days or older than a given date-time.


Arguments:
dir_path
   is the pathname of the directory in which the deletions are to
   occur; dir_path can be -working_directory (-wd) to indicate the
   working directory.
cutoff
   is a positive integer number of days.  If it is an integer N, files
   with a date more than N days old are deleted; if it is a date-time
   DT, files with a date earlier than DT are deleted.
   (See time_strings.gi.)
star_names
   are the optional starnames of files to be deleted.  If you supply
   none, all files older than the specified number of days are deleted;
   otherwise only files matching one or more of the starnames, and
   older than the specified number of days, are deleted.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the entire pathname of the entries listed by -long,
   -query_all, and -query_each.  (Default: to print entrynames)
-all, -a, -branch, -br
   deletes directories, segments, and multisegment files.
-date_time_contents_modified, -dtcm
   uses the date/time value specified in the dtcm attribute to
   calculate the deletion date.  (Default)
-date_time_dumped, -dtd
   uses the dtd of each entry instead of the dtcm.
-date_time_entry_modified, -dtem
   uses the dtem of each entry instead of the dtcm.
-date_time_used, -dtu
   uses the dtu of each entry instead of the dtcm.


-directory, -dr
   deletes directories only.
-entryname, -etnm
   prints only the entrynames of the files listed by -long, -query_all,
   and -query_each rather than the entire pathname.  (Default)
-file, -f
   deletes segments and multisegment files.  (Default)
-long, -lg
   prints a message of the form "Deleted <type> <path>" for each entry
   deleted.
-multisegment_file, -msf
   multisegment files only.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a starname STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument.


-query_all, -qya
   lists all entries to be deleted and queries whether they should be
   deleted or not.
-query_each, -qye
   queries for every entry to be deleted.
-segment, -sm
   deletes segments only.
