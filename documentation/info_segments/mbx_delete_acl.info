Syntax as a command:  mbda path {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function:  deletes entries from the access control lists (ACLs) of
mailboxes.  (For a description of ACLs, see the Programmer's Reference
Manual.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a mailbox; the mbx suffix is assumed.  The star
   convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   entries with matching names are deleted.  If you give no User_ids,
   your own is assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes all entries except for *.*.*.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the messages "User name not on ACL" and "Empty ACL."
-chase
   chases links when using the star convention.  Links are always
   chased when path is not a starname.
-no_chase
   does not chase links when using the star convention.  (Default)


Access required:  You need modify permission on the directory
containing the mailbox.
