09/05/87  rename, rn

Syntax as a command:  rn path1 name1 {...pathN nameN} {-control_args}


Function:  replaces a specified segment, multisegment file (MSF), data
management (DM) file, directory, link, or extended entry name by a
specified new name, without affecting any other names the entry might
have.


Arguments:
paths
   is the pathname of a segment, MSF, DM file, directory, link, or
   extended entry.  This argument can be "-name STR" to specify a
   nonstandard name, such as one beginning with a minus sign or
   containing * or <.  You can use the star convention, but it does not
   apply to STR.
names
   specifies the new name that replaces the storage system entryname
   portion of paths.  This argument can be "-name STR".  You can use
   the equal convention, but it does not apply to STR.


Control arguments:
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.


Access required:  You require modify permission on the containing
directory.


Notes:  Since two entries in a directory cannot have the same
entryname, rename takes special action if names already exists.  If the
entry having the entryname names has an alternate name, entryname names
is removed and you are informed of this action; renaming then occurs.
If the entry having the entryname names has only one name, the entry
must be deleted to remove the name.  You are asked whether you want the
deletion; if you answer "no," renaming does not happen.
