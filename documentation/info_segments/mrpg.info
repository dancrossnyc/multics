:Info: mrpg:  1986-06-11  mrpg

Syntax as a command:  mrpg path {pl1_control_args}


Function:  The mrpg command invokes the MRPG to translate a segment
containing MRPG source statements into a segment containing PL/I source
statements.  Then the PL/I compiler is automatically invoked to
translate the segment containing PL/I source statements into a standard
Multics object segment.  PL/I control arguments may be supplied with
the mrpg command.  These PL/I control arguments are passed on by the
MRPG to the PL/I compiler.  The results are placed in the user's
working directory.  The mrpg command cannot be called recursively.  For
information on PL/I, refer to the PL/I manuals.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the MRPG source segment that is to be translated
   by the MRPG.  If path does not have a suffix of mrpg, then one is
   assumed.  However, the suffix mrpg must be the last component of
   the name of the source segment given.
PL/I control_arguments (optional)
   can be chosen from the list of control arguments for the pl1
   command in the MPM Commands.  No checking is done by the MRPG
   on the supplied PL/I control arguments.


Notes:  The PL/I source segment produced by the MRPG is placed in the
user's working directory.  This segment's name is the same as the name
of the segment supplied as input to the MRPG except that the mrpg
suffix is replaced with a pl1 suffix.


The PL/I source segment is not deleted by the MRPG.


The object segment produced by the PL/I compiler is placed in the
user's working directory.  This segment's name is the same as the name
of the original source segment with the mrpg suffix omitted.
