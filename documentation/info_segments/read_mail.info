10/10/83  read_mail, rdm

Syntax:  rdm {mbx_specification} {-control_args}


Function:  selectively lists, prints, deletes, saves and forwards
messages and mail sent to a mailbox.


Arguments:
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox to be exmained.  If not given, the user's
   default mailbox (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx) is used.


List of mbx_specifications:
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix "mbx" is added if
   necessary.
-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.  See "Notes on mailbox selection by user" below for more
   information.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix "sv.mbx" is added
   if necessary.
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to:
         -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx


STR
   is any non-control argument and is first interpreted as: 
         -mailbox STR
   if no mailbox is found, this specification is then interpreted as:
         -save STR
   if no savebox is found, this specification is then interpreted as:
         -user STR


Control arguments:
-interactive_messages, -im
   specifies that read_mail should process interactive messages in the
   mailbox.
-no_interactive_messages, -nim
   specifies that read_mail should not process interactive messages.
   Use of this control argument is incompatible with -no_mail.
   (Default)
-mail, -ml
   specifies that read_mail should process ordinary messages in the
   mailbox.  (Default)
-no_mail, -nml
   specifies that read_mail should not process ordinary messages.  Use
   of this control argument is incompatible with -nim.


-accessible, -acc
   specifies that read_mail should only select those messages in the
   mailbox that the user is permitted to read.  If the user has read
   (r) extended access on the mailbox, read_mail will select all
   messages in the mailbox; if the user has own (o) extended access on
   the mailbox, read_mail will select only those messages which the
   user sent to the mailbox.  (Default)
-all, -a
   specifies that read_mail should select all messages in the mailbox
   regardless of who sent them.  Use of this control argument requires
   read (r) extended access on the mailbox.


-own
   specifies that read_mail should select only those messages in the
   mailbox that the user himself sent to the mailbox.  Use of this
   control argument requires own (o) extended access on the mailbox.
-not_own
   specifies that read_mail should select only those messages in the
   mailbox that were not sent by the user.  Use of this control
   argument requires read (r) extended access on the mailbox.
-count, -ct
   prints the number of messages being read before entering the request
   loop.  (Default)
-no_count, -nct
   does not print the message count.


-totals, -tt
   prints the number of the messages in the mailbox and exits without
   entering the request loop.  This control argument is incompatible
   with -print, -list, -request, and -quit.
-request_loop, -rql
   enters the read_mail request loop even if there are no messages
   in the mailbox.
-no_request_loop, -nrql
   does not enter the request loop if there are no messages in the
   mailbox.  (Default)
-list, -ls
   lists the messages in the mailbox before entering the request loop.
-no_list, -nls
   does not list the messages before entering request loop.  (Default)


-print, -pr
   prints all messages in the mailbox before entering the request loop.
-no_print, -npr
   does not the print messages before entering request loop.  (Default)
-request STR, -rq STR
   executes STR as a read_mail request line before entering the
   request loop.
-quit
   exits read_mail after performing any operations given by the -list,
   -print, or -request control arguments; this control argument must be
   given in combination with one of those.
-acknowledge, -ack
   acknowledges messages which request acknowledgement.  (Default)
-no_acknowledge, -nack
   does not acknowledge messages which request acknowledgement.


-brief, -bf
   shortens some informative messages and suppresses others.
-long, -lg
   prints the long form of all informative messages.  (Default)
-abbrev, -ab
   enables abbreviation expansion of request lines.
-no_abbrev, -nab
   does not enable abbreviation expansion of request lines.  (Default)
-profile path, -pf path
   specifies the pathname of the profile to use for abbreviation
   expansion.  The suffix "profile" is added if necessary.  This
   control argument implies -abbrev.


-prompt STR, -pmt STR
   sets the request loop prompt to STR.  The default is:
         ^/read_mail^[ (^d)^]:^2x
-no_prompt, -npmt
   suppresses the prompt for request lines in the request loop.
-debug, -db
   enables read_mail's debugging facilities.  Use of this control
   argument is not recommended for normal users of read_mail.
-no_debug, -ndb
   disables read_mail's debugging facilities.  (Default)


Notes on mailbox selection by user:
As listed above, the "-user STR" mbx_specification is used to select
either a user's default mailbox or the mailbox identified by an entry
in the system wide mail table.  For more information on the mail table,
type:
     help mail_table.gi


If the above STR contains exactly one period and no whitespace, it is
interpreted as a User_id which specifies a user's default mailbox;
otherwise, it is interpreted as the name of an entry in the mail table.

For example,
     -user Sibert.SiteSA
is interpreted as a User_id which identifies a default mailbox.  On the
other hand,
     -user "Gary M. Palter"
     -user J.C.Snead
are both interpreted as the names of entries in the mail table; the
first because it contains whitespace and the second because it contains
more than one period.


When interpreted as a User_id, the STR may not contain any angle
brackets (<>) and must have the form Person_id.Project_id where
Person_id may not exceed 28 characters in length and Project_id may not
exceed 32 characters in length.  In this case, "-user STR" is
equivalent to the mbx_specification
     -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx

When interpreted as the name of a mail table entry, STR may not contain
any commas, colons, semi-colons, backslashes (\), parentheses, angle
brackets (<>), braces ({}), quotes ("), commercial at-signs (@), or
whitespace other than spaces.  The query of the mail table is performed
in a case insensitive manner.  The display_mailing_address command may
be used to determine the actual address corresponding to the STR.  The
address in the mail table must identify a mailbox.


Notes on control arguments affecting individual requests:
Control arguments may be specified on the read_mail command line to
change the default behavior of individual requests.  Use of these
control arguments on the command line is identical to specifying them
for each use of the particular request.  Of course, the modified
default behavior of a request may be overriden for individual uses of
the request by use of the appropriate control argument.

Type:
   help request_name
within read_mail for more detail on the effect of the following control
arguments.


List of control arguments affecting the print request:
-long_header, -lghe
   specifies that the print request is to display all information from
   the message header including network tracing information even if
   some of the information is redundant.
-header, -he
   specifies that the print request is to display all information from
   the message header including user-defined fields while excluding the
   message trace and redundant information.  (Default)
-brief_header, -bfhe
   specifies that the print request is to display the minimal amount of
   information from the message header.
-no_header, -nhe
   specifies that print request is to display absolutely no information
   from the message header.  Only the message number, message body line
   count, and message body will be displayed.


List of control arguments affecting the reply request:
-include_authors, -iat
   includes the author(s) of the message as recipients of the reply.
   (Default)
-no_include_authors, -niat
   does not include the author(s) of the message as recipients of the
   reply.
-include_recipients, -irc
   includes the recipients of the message as recipients of the reply.
-no_include_recipients, -nirc
   does not include the recipients of the message as recipients of the
   reply.  (Default)


-include_self, -is
   allows the user of read_mail to be a recipient of the reply without
   explicit use of -to or -cc.
-no_include_self, -nis
   does not include the user of read_mail as a recipient of the reply
   unless explicitly requested via -to or -cc.  (Default)
-include_original, -io
   includes the original message as part of the text of the reply.
-no_include_original, -nio
   does not put the original message into the reply's text.  (Default)
-indent N, -ind N
   indents the original message when -include_original is specified.
   (Default -- 4)


-fill, -fi
   causes the reply message to be filled before transmission.
   (Default for -terminal_input)
-no_fill, -nfi
   causes the reply message to not be filled before transmission.
   (Default for -input_file)
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length used when filling the reply message.
   (Default -- 72)


Notes:
Messages are not actually deleted until read_mail is exited via the
quit request.  While within read_mail, messages which are accidently
marked for deletion can be restored by using the retrieve request.
