08/01/84  display_mrds_scope_settings, dmss

Syntax as a command:  dmss


Function:  This command displays concurrency control scope mode
information for all currently open data bases in the user's process.
The versions of the concurrency control, data base, and submodel (if
used for the opening) are displayed, as well as the absolute paths of
the data base and the submodel (if used for the opening).  The opening
mode is also displayed.


Notes:  All versions of data base scope settings may be displayed with
r-s-m-d modes used for version 3 and earlier data bases, and read_attr,
modify_attr, append_tuple, and delete_tuple (abbreviated as r-m-a-d)
used for version 4 data bases with version 5 concurrency control.  (See
the notes section of adjust_mrds_db on version 5 concurrency control;
this is not the same as version 5 submodels.)
