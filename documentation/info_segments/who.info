Syntax as a command:  who {User_ids} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [who {User_ids} {-control_args}]


Function: lists the number, identification, and status of all users of
the system; it prints out a header and lists the name and project of
each user.  The header consists of the system name, the total number of
users, the current system load, the maximum load, the current number of
absentee users, and the maximum number of absentee users.  (See the
how_many_users command to print only the header.)


Arguments:
User_ids
   are match names, where:
   Person_id
      lists users with the name Person_id.
   .Project_id
      lists users with the project name Project_id.
   Person_id.Project.id
      lists users with the specified person and project.


Control arguments:
-absentee, -as
   lists absentee users (see "Notes").
-all, -a
   lists all the interactive, absentee, and daemon users.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the printing of the header.  Not allowed for the active
   function.
-daemon, -dmn
   lists daemon users (see "Notes").
-interactive, -ia
   lists interactive users (see "Notes").


-long, -lg
   prints the date and time logged in, the terminal identification, and
   the load units, name, and project of each user.  The header includes
   installation identification and the time the system was brought up.
   If available, the time of the next scheduled shutdown, the time when
   service will resume after the shutdown, and the time of the previous
   shutdown are printed.  Not allowed for the active function.
-name, -nm
   sorts the output by the name (Person_id) of each user.
-project, -pj
   sorts the output by the Project_id of each user.


Notes: If you supply none of -interactive, -absentee, or -daemon and
give no User_ids, then all interactive and absentee users are listed;
but if you specify User_ids, then all matching users are listed.  If
you provide one or more of -interactive, -absentee, or -daemon, only
processes of the selected type(s) are listed; if you also select
User_ids, then only users matching those control arguments and the
User_ids are listed.

Absentee users are denoted in the list by an asterisk following
Person_id.Project_id.

If you omit -name and -project, the output is sorted on login time.
You can't use both arguments together because the sort is performed on
one key at a time.


If you supply a User_id, the header is suppressed even if you give
-long.  If you use who with no arguments, the system responds with a
two-line header followed by a list of interactive users sorted
according to login time.

Sometimes a Person_id.Project_id returned by the command is followed by
a "D" and/or an "S", where "D" refers to a disconnected process and "S"
refers to a suspended process.

You can prevent your own name from being listed by all users'
invocations of who; to do this, see your project administrator.


Notes on active function: The active function returns a list of
Person_id.Project_id pairs, requoted and separated by spaces.  You can
use control arguments to select and sort.
