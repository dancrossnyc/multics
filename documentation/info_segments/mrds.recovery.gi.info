:Info: mrds.recovery.gi: mrds.recovery:  1980-05-14  mrds.recovery

Function: This is a description of the procedure for backing up mrds
databases and then recovering to that earlier state of the database.


Procedure: To obtain the backup copy of the database, do a
quiesce_mrds_db on the current database, then do a copy_dir of the
database directory into another part of the storage hierarchy, and
finally do quiesce_mrds_db with the -free option on the original
database.


To return to the earlier state of the database that has been backed
up, do a quiesce_mrds_db of the current database, delete that
database with a delete_dir, do a copy_dir of the backup copy into the
original storage location, then finally do a quiesce_mrds_db with the
-free option on the new current database.


Notes: The quiescing process is the only process that can open or
update the backup copy of the database.

The backup copy can be freed from the quiescent state if it is to be
used for program development, rather than as a static backup copy.

Recovery of a database quiesced by a dead process requires two
commands:	quiesce_mrds_db path -free
	adjust_mrds_db path -trouble_switch off
However, there is danger of an inconsistent database.

If display_mrds_db_status shows many open users, a long wait time may
be needed for quiesce_mrds_db.  However, a short wait time will work
as a go/no_go test.  Also, dmdbs will show if the database is in a
quiescent state.
