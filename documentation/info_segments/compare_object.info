03/14/84  compare_object, cob

Syntax:  cob oldpath newpath {-control_args}


Function: compares two object segments and optionally prints out the
changes made to the segment specified by oldpath to yield the segment
specified by newpath.  The assumption is that the first segment is
older than the second and that they were both produced from the same
source segment but, potentially, by different versions of a language
processor.


Arguments:
oldpath
   is the pathname of the first segment.
newpath
   is the pathname of the second segment.  The equal convention is
   allowed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   compares the text, definition, linkage, and any static sections.
   (Default)
-brief, -bf
   prints out by section a summary of discrepancies in the object
   segments, suppressing detailed listing of the discrepancies.
-defs
   compares the definition sections.


-link, -lk
   compares the linkage sections.
-static
   compares the static section of two segments with separate static;
   otherwise, compares the linkage sections.
-text
   compares the text sections of the two segments.


Notes: If no control arguments are given, all the sections are
compared but the static.

In comparing the lengths of the symbol sections the command uses a
heuristic to determine whether a discrepancy is serious or trivial
(e.g., caused by differences in pathnames of include files).  This
heuristic overcautions and is inaccurate for large object segments.
