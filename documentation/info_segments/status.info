07/25/90  status, st


Syntax as a command:  st paths {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [st path -control_args {-chase}]


Function:  prints selected detailed status information about specified
storage system entries.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments, multisegment files (MSFs), data
   management (DM) files, directories, and links for which you want
   status information.  The default pathname is your working directory
   or -working_directory (-wd).  This argument can be "-nsn STR" to
   specified a nonstandard segment name, such as one beginning with a
   minus sign or containing any of the nonstandard characters "< * ?  =
   % $ .  :  !  ::" and STR must be in the working directory.  The star
   convention is allowed but does not apply to STR.


Control arguments:
-author, -at
   prints the author of the entry.
-chase
   prints information about the branch targets of links instead of the
   links themselves.  An error occurs for a null link or a link to a
   null link.
-chase_if_possible, -cip
   prints information about the targets of links where branch targets
   exist and about the ultimate link in the chain for null links and
   links to null links.  It does not affect the processing of nonlinks.
-date, -dt
   prints all the relevant dates on the entry.
-date_time_dumped, -dtd
   prints the date-time-dumped by the hierarchy dumper.


-date_time_entry_modified, -dtem
   prints the date-time-entry-modified.
-directory, -dr
   selects directories when using the star convention.
-entry_type, -ettp, -type, -tp
   prints the type of entry, which can be one of the standard types
   (segment, MSF, DM file, directory, or link) or one of the available
   extended types (e.g., mailbox).
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interprets the selected entries as extended entry types.  (Default)
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entries as standard entry types.
-link, -lk
   selects links when using the star convention.


-name, -nm
   prints all the names on the entry.
-no_chase
   prints link information about links.  (Default)
-no_chase_if_possible, -ncip
   prints link information about links.  (Default)
-primary, -pri
   prints the primary name on the entry.
-segment, -sm
   selects segments when using the star convention.
-select_entry_type STR, -slet STR
   selects entries of the types specified by STR, which is a
   comma-delimited list of file system entry types.  Use the
   list_entry_types command to obtain a list of valid entry type
   values.


-switch SW_NAME
   prints whether the specified SW_NAME is on or off, where SW_NAME is
   the name of a switch.  Valid switch names are copy,
   complete_volume_dump, damaged, incremental_volume_dump, safety,
   synchronized or any valid exteded entry type switch name.
-access, -ac
   prints your effective mode, ring brackets, access class (if
   different from the default), and safety switch (if on).
-access_class, -acc
   prints the access class.


-all, -a, -long, -lg
   prints all relevant information about the object or link:  the type
   of entry, the pathname of the entry being linked to, names, the
   unique identifier, the date-used, the date-modified, the
   date-branch-modified, the date-link-modified, the date-dumped by
   hierarchy and volume dumpers, the author, the bit count author (if
   different from the author), the device, the bit count, records used,
   current blocks (for segments, if different from records used), the
   maximum length in words (if type is segment), the safety switch (if
   on), the damaged switch (if on), your mode, ring brackets, the
   access class (if not null), the copy switch (if on), the audit
   switch (if on), and the volume dumper control switches (if off).
   Bit count author, bit count, safety switch, and copy switch are not
   printed for DM files.  Synchronized switch is not printed for
   directories.


-audit_switch, -asw
   prints whether the audit switch is on or off.
-bc_author, -bca
   prints the bit count author who last sets bit count of the entry.
   Not valid for DM files.
-bit_count, -bc
   prints the bit count.  Not valid for DM files.
-copy_switch, -csw
   prints whether the copy switch is on or off.  Not valid for DM
   files.
-current_length, -cl
   prints the current length in pages.
-damaged_switch, -dsw
   prints whether the damaged switch is on or off.


-date, -dt
   prints all the dates on the entry (date-used,
   date-contents-modified, date-branch-modified, date-dumped).
-date_time_contents_modified, -dtcm
   prints the date-time-contents-modified.
-date_time_used, -dtu
   prints the date-time-used.
-date_time_volume_dumped, -dtvd
   prints the date-time-dumped by the volume dumper.
-device, -dv, -logical_volume, -lv
   prints the logical volume on which the entry resides.


-length, -ln
         1.  When used as a status active function, for segments or
      MSFs or DM files:  returns the current length.

      for directories:  returns the bit count.

         2.  When used as a status command, for segments:  prints the
      bit count, the number of records used, the current blocks (if
      different from records used), and the maximum length in words;

      for MSFs:  prints the number of records used by the whole file,
      the sum of the bit counts of all components, and the number of
      components;


      for DM files:  prints the number of records used and the number
      of the highest control interval.

      for directories:  prints the number of records used and the bit
      count.
-max_length, -ml

-mode, -md
   prints your effective mode.
-records, -rec
   prints the records used.

-unique_id, -uid
   prints the entry's unique identifier.  For DM files, prints the file
   manager (fm) unique id.
-comp_volume_dump_switch, -cvds
   prints whether the complete volume dump switch is on or off.
-incr_volume_dump_switch, -ivds
   prints whether the incremental volume dump switch is on or off.
-usage_count, -use

   creation.
-concurrency_sw, -concsw

Notes:  If you supply no control arguments, the following information
is printed for segments, MSFs, DM files, and directories:  names, the
type, the date-used, the date-modified, the date-branch-modified, the
bit count, records used, your mode, and the access class; for links:
the pathname of the entry linked to, names, the date-link-modified, the
date-dumped.


The -device, -length, -logical_volume, and -mode control arguments are
ignored for links.


Zero-valued dates (i.e., dates that have never been set) and attributes
