07/16/79  transaction_call, trc

Syntax:  trc opname switchname {args}


Function: This command performs operations on a vfile_ transaction control file
(TCF) I/O switch.


Arguments:
opname
   specifies the operation to perform.  See "List of operations" section below.
switchname
   is the TCF I/O switch name.
args
   depend upon the operation.


List of operations:
assign, a: trc a switchname
   reserves a new transaction number.
commit, c: trc c switchname
   commit the current transaction.
number, n: trc n switchname
   print the current transaction number.
rollback, r: trc r switchname
   rolls back the current transaction.
status, s: trc s switchname {transaction_no} {-control_args}
   prints the status of transaction transaction_no.  If transaction_no is
   omitted or zero, the current transaction number is used.  Control arguments
   may be -brief, -verify.
transact, t: trc t switchname {-control_args} command_line
   executes the command line as a transaction.  The command line need not be
   enclosed in quotes.  Control arguments may be -retry, -signal, -no_signal.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   (status) don't count and print the number of passive and nonpassive
   references made by the transaction.
-verify, -vf
   (status) check all passive references for asynchronous changes.
-retry N
   (transact) specifies maximum number of times to retry the transaction if
   commitment fails.  The default is zero.
-signal
   (transact) if commitment fails and the retry count has been exceeded, signal
   the transaction_failure condition.  This is the default.  After
   transaction_failure has been signaled, program_interrupt will re-execute the
   command line as a transaction.  The start command does not.  The transaction
   is rolled back before transaction_failure is signaled.
-no_signal
   (transact) don't signal the transaction_failure condition if commitment
   fails and the retry count has been exceeded.
