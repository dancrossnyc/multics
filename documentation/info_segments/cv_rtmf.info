Syntax:  cv_rtmf rtmf_path {-control_args}


Function:  converts an ASCII resource type master file (RTMF) into a
binary resource type description table (RTDT).  The binary table is
installed using the install command (see the MAM System).  If the user
has made any errors in the RTMF, this command prints error messages
while performing the conversion.


Arguments:
rtmf_path
   is the pathname of the resource type master file.  If path does not
   have a suffix of rtmf, one is assumed.  However, the suffix rtmf
   must be the last component of the name of the source segment.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints short form of error messages
-long, -lg
   prints long form of error messages
-severity N, -sv N
   causes error messages whose severity is less than N (where N is 0,
   1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written to the user_output switch.  If this
   control argument is not specified, a severity level of 0 is assumed
   (i.e., all error messages are written to the user_output switch).


Notes:  If no control arguments are given, an error message is printed
in long form the first time it occurs, and in short form thereafter.

The converted resource type master file is given a name corresponding
to the entryname of the source segment, with the rtmf suffix replaced
by rtdt.  It is placed in the working directory.
