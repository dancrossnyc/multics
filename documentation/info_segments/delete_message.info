01/28/86  delete_message, dlm

Syntax as a command:  dlm msg_specs {mbx_specification} {-control_args}


Function: deletes any interprocess messages that were received (and
saved in the user's mailbox) while the user was not accepting messages,
not logged in, or accept_messages -hold_messages was in effect.


Arguments:
msg_specs
   are one or more numbers or ranges.  Numbers are as printed next to
   each message when accept_messages -hold_messages is in effect.
   Ranges are of the form N:M, where N<=M and both N and M are valid
   message numbers.  You can use the keywords "first" (f) and "last"
   (l) as message numbers and the keyword "all" (a) as a range
   (equivalent to "f:l").
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox on which messages are to be deleted.  If not
   given, the user's default mailbox (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx)
   is used.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to
      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.


-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.


Control arguments:
-after time_string
   deletes messages sent after time_string only (see "Notes").
-all, -a
   delets all messages, including those held by -hold_messages mode
   (see accept_messages).
-before time_string
   deletes messages sent before time_string only (see "Notes").
-brief, -bf
   suppresses an error message when no matching messages are found.
-comment STR, -com STR
   deletes messages with comment fields containing STR only.
-exclude STR
   deletes messages with text not containing STR only.


-force, -fc
   deletes selected unseen messages.
-from STR, -fm STR
   deletes messages sent from STR only.  STR can be of the form
   Person.Project, Person, or .Project.
-long, -lg
   overrides -brief.
-match STR
   deletes messages with text containing STR only.
-messages, -msg
   deletes regular messages (nonnotifications) only.
-no_force, -nfc
   prevents deletion of unseen messages.  (Default)


-no_messages, -nmsg
   suppresses -messages.
-no_notifications, -nnt
   suppresses -notifications.
-notifications, -nt
   deletes notifications only.


Notes: If you supply no mailbox, your default one is assumed (for a
description of the mailbox see accept_messages and print_mail).

See time_strings.gi for a description of valid time_string values.
