Syntax:  ecr paths {-control_args}


Function:	 Queues a segment or subtree to be carried to another site.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments and directories.	 In the case of a
   directory, the entire subtree is carried.  The star convention
   is allowed.


Control arguments:
-destination DEST, -ds DEST
   specifies a destination site, where DEST is up to 23 characters
   long.	The carry queue used is named DEST.carry.ms.  If no
   destination is specified, it is carry.ms, the name added to the
   queue for the default destination.
-queue_dir PATH, -qd PATH
   specifies the queue's parent directory.  The default is
   >daemon_dir_dir>carry_dir.
-new_dir PATH, -nd PATH
   applies to the preceding path argument and causes the entry to be
   loaded under PATH instead of its original parent.
-notify, -nt
   sends mail to the requestor when the request is dumped.
-no_notify, -nnt
   suppresses sending of mail when the request is dumped. (Default)


-no_trim
   suppresses the deletion, when requests are loaded at the target
   site, of entries in target subtrees that do not appear in the
   corresponding subtrees at the sending site. (Default)
-trim
   deletes entries in subtrees at the target site that do not exist in
   the corresponding subtrees at the sending site.  The default is
   -no_trim.
-user STR
   where STR is of the form Person_id.Project_id, specifies the owner
   of the carried entries at the target site, if different from the
   user requesting the carry.	 When an entry cannot be loaded in place,
   this control argument causes access to the retrieved copy to be set
   for STR, rather than for the requesting user.	It is needed if the
   requestor is registered with a different name at each site.  Default
   for STR is the User_id of the requesting user.


Access required:
1. s to all carry administrators on the parent directory.
2. sma to the user and to all carry administrators on all directories
   in a subtree being carried.
3. r to the user and to all carry administrators on a segment being
   carried or on all segments in a subtree being carried.


   If the user does not have sa access to the parent directory at the
target site, the entry is not loaded and a copy is loaded instead in a
directory under >daemon_dir_dir>carry_dir>copies.


   If any directories in the pathname of a target entry do not exist,
they are created.


Notes:
   See also list_carry_requests and cancel_carry_request.  The carry
queue is read periodically and the requested entries are dumped on a
tape. This tape is mailed to the target site, where it is loaded.


   The process that dumps and loads carry tapes belongs to a carry
administrator, a user with r and d extended access to the queue.  In
most cases, there is only one carry administrator, for example
Carry.Multics.*
