11/13/81  runoff_abs, rfa

Syntax:  rfa paths {-rf_args} {-dp_args} {-control_args}


Function: submits an absentee request to process text segments using the runoff
command.


Arguments: 
paths
   are the pathnames of segments to be processed by runoff.
rf_args
   are control arguments accepted by the runoff command.
dp_args
   are control arguments (except -delete and -indent) accepted by the
   dprint command.


Control arguments:
-queue N, -q N
   is the priority queue of the request.  The default queue is defined
   by the system administrator.  See the Notes for a description of the
   interaction with the dprinting of output files.
-hold
   do not dprint or delete any output files.
-output_file path, -of path
   put absentee output in segment path.
-limit N, -li N
   specifies time limit in seconds for the absentee job.


Notes:
Control arguments and paths can be mixed freely and can appear anywhere
on the command line after the command.

Unpredictable results can occur if two absentee requests are submitted
that simultaneously attempt to compile the same segment or write into
the same absout segment.

If the -indent control argument is given to this command, it is
interpreted as the runoff control argument; not as the dprint control
argument.


If the -queue control argument is not specified, the request is
submitted into the default absentee priority queue defined by the site
and, if requested, the output files will be dprinted in the default
queue of the request type specified on the command line.  (If no
request type is specified, the "printer" request type is used.)

If the -queue control argument is specified, and, if requested, the
output files will be dprinted in the same queue as is used for the
absentee request.  If the request type specified for dprinting does not
have that queue, the highest numbered queue available for the request
type is used and a warning is issued.
