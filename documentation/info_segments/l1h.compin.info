Syntax:  .ifi lXh "paragraph-title"


Function:  These macros generate paragraph headings with
'paragraph-title' translated into the font defined for the level
(except see "Module and prose modes" below) and generate an appropriate
entry in the Table of Contents.


Arguments:
'paragraph-title' is the paragraph title as it is to appear in the
   Table of Contents (except see "Module and prose modes" below)


 Module and prose modes:
 If 'paragraph-title' begins with the UNDERLINED words 'Name', 'Names',
 'Entry', or 'Entries' followed by a colon (:), the macros switch from
 prose description to module description and remain in the new mode for
 the rest of the section or document (or until the next use of l0h or
 one of the 'init' macros).  The 'paragraph-title' causing the switch
 is NOT translated into the level font, but is set into the paragraph
 heading as is.  The initial word and the colon are stripped off the
 Table of Contents entry.


The 'Name' and 'Names' forms cause a new page to be begun and a boxed
page header to be generated for the first (or only) name given.


The 'Entry' and 'Entries' forms cause a half-page-width horizontal
separtor bar to be placed on the page.


When in module description mode, the macros DO NOT generate Table of
Contents entries for 'paragraph-title's that do not begin with the
keywords above.


The macro supports multiline headers by honoring the "!"  convention.
The entry:

        .ifi l4h "Paragraph Title! (subtitle)"

 will generate the header:

        Paragraph title
          (subtitle)

The macro will honor the current linelength so that headers are
adjusted to fit the shorter lines when using multicolumn format.


Examples:
A section in the MPM Commands might contain

        .ifi init_mpm "AG92"
        .sr section 1
        .ifi l0h "Multics Command Environment"
             The Multics command environment ....
        .ifi l1h "Reference to Commands by Function"
             The Multics command repertoire ...
        .ifi l2h "Access to the System"


A module description with a standard size page might contain

        .ifi init_plm "AN80"
        .ifi l1h "Names:  check_mst, ckm"
             This command is used to read one ...
        .ifi l2h "Usage"
             check_mst input_args control_args
        .sp 1
        where:
        .sp 1
        .inl 12
        .unl 12
        1.   input_args     ...
        .brf
        .unl 12



        2.   control_args   ...

             .
             .

        .ifi l2h "Notes"
             The control arguments ...
        .ifi l2h "Entry:  check_mst$test"

 Change bars:
 If the .ifi line in the calling file is within the range of an active
 change-bar control and a Table of Contents entry is to be made, the
 active change-bar mark will also be shown on the Table of Contents
 entry.  However, if a new section is being ADDED (without change-bars)
 with the dot-page feature you must use the following to get the Table
 of Contents change-bars:

       .ifi dot_page X
       .ifi l?exact "New Section Title"
       .cba
       .ifi l?toc "New Section Title"
       .cbf


Notes:
To cancel a box header set with LXhbox, the user should enter:

        .ifi lXhbox ""

The new box header implemented makes the prose_box and
prose_box_off macros obsolete, but the entrypoints will be
retained because of their extensive use in the COBOL
documentation.
