02/08/85  create_dir, cd

Syntax as a command:  cd paths {-control_args}


Function: creates a specified directory branch in a specified
directory or in your working directory; that is, it creates a storage
system entry for an empty subdirectory.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of directories to be created.


Control arguments:
-access_class STR, -acc STR
   applies to each pathi and upgrades each directory created to the
   specified access class.  You can give the access class with either
   long or short names.
-account STR, -acct STR
   specifies the volume quota account from which the created master
   directory is to draw its quota, where STR must match an existing
   quota account on the given logical volume.  If omitted, an account
   that matches the owner User_id is used (if any).  You can supply
   -account only if you select -logical_volume.
-dir_quota N
   specifies the directory quota to be given to the directory when it
   is created, where N must be a positive integer and applies to each
   pathi.  If omitted, the directory is given zero directory quota.


-logical_volume VOL, -lv VOL
   specifies that each directory created is to be a master directory
   whose segments are to reside on the logical volume named VOL.
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies an entryname STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument, or consists solely of white
   space.
-owner USER_ID, -ow USER_ID
   specifies the owner of the created master directory.  You can supply
   -owner only if you select -logical_volume.  (Default: your User_id)


-quota N
   specifies the segment quota to be given to the directory when it is
   created, where N must be a positive integer and applies to each
   pathi.  You must provide -quota if you use either -access_class or
   -logical_volume.  If omitted, the directory is given zero segment
   quota.
-ring_brackets N1 {N2}, -rb N1 {N2}
   specifies the ring brackets of the created directory.  N2 defaults
   to N1, which defaults to 7.


Access required: You must have a access to a directory in order to
create a subdirectory in that directory.

The -account and -owner control arguments are allowed only for volume
administrators (i.e., only those who have e access to the volume).


Notes: If you specify a directory or segment quota and the directory
you are creating is not a master directory, the containing directory
must have sufficient directory or segment quota to move quota to the
directory being created (see move_quota).

If the creation of a new subdirectory introduces a duplication of names
within the directory and if the old entry has only one name, you are
asked whether to delete the old entry.  If the old entry has multiple
names, the conflicting name is removed and a message is issued to you.
You are given sma access on the created subdirectory.

All superior directories specified in pathi must already exist.  That
is, you can only create a single level of storage system directory
hierarchy in a single invocation of create_dir.


To create a master directory, you must have a quota account on the
logical volume with sufficient volume quota to create the directory.
If you are not a volume administrator, you can create a master
directory only if the administrator has created a quota account that
matches your User_id.  A master directory must always have a nonzero
quota; therefore you must always give -quota when creating a master
directory.  You can create a master directory even though the logical
volume is not mounted.

Each upgraded directory must have a quota greater than zero and must
have an access class that is greater than its containing directory.
The specified access class must also be less than, or equal to, the
maximum access authorization of the process.


When you supply -access_class, the command does not create a new
directory through a link.  Creating through links is allowed only when
the access class of the containing directory is taken as the default.

See the create and link commands for the creation of segments and
links.
