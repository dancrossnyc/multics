02/09/84  register

Syntax:  register


Function: allows the accounting administrator to register a new user.
It enters his Person_id in both the URF and PNT segments.  If a person
is already a user of Multics, or if he was once registered and was not
removed, this command should not be used since the user is still in
the URF and PNT segments.


Notes:  The accounting administrator can type "stop" at any time to
abort the processing of the current user; for instance, he may want to
abort if he misspells the user's last name or if the user is already
registered.
