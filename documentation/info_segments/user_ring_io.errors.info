Description

6  phx13287
ioa_ resets the column count to zero on each invocation, regardless of
whether or not it was a $nnl.  This causes ^t to be passing useless with
ioa_$Xnnl.

This is extremely messy to improve, since per-switch static information
would be needed.  Even then, other iox_ calls could screw things up.
For the moment, then, ^t wil remain defined to refer to the current
fragment produced with the current call.  The documentation should be
made crystal clear on this issue.


5  phx12631
There is a failure to chase the actual_iocb_ptr pointer in some ofthe
calls in cross_ring_.  Thus syn_ attachments in the user ring fail.

4  phx07196
There is no arbitration for the several subsystem that claim to "own"
the basic terminal attachment.  Some protocol is needed.
