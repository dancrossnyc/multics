pg 7-37:  in the "'options(constant)' Attribute" section add the  |
     following paragraphs to the end of the page.                 |
                                                                  |
         Variables with the attribute 'options(constant)' may     |
         replace literal constants in label arrays, and in        |
         declare statements (scale, precision, initial values,    |
         length and bounds only).                                 |
                                                                  |
         The pl1 compiler will sometimes optimize constant        |
         references so that direct (immediate) operands are       |
         referenced, as opposed to their text section             |
         equivalents.                                             |


pg 8-33:  for the "String Constant Literals" section, change the
     first sentence of rule number 3 to

     3.  A replication factor is a parenthesized integer literal
         or named constant whose value is greater than zero.


pg 15-9:  in the "File Descriptions" diagram, replace "(string    |
     value)" with "(stringvalue)".                                |
