07/30/86  Relative pathnames (general information)

Relative pathnames are pathnames which are interpreted relative to the
working directory.  An entryname or a pathname which does not begin
with a greater than character (">") is a relative pathname.  A relative
pathname may begin with one or more less than characters ("<").  Each
less than character is interpreted as one directory level closer to the
root directory than the working directory.  A relative pathname may
be converted to an absolute pathname if the working directory is known,
provided that there are no more less than characters in the relative
pathname than there are directory names in the working directory
pathname.


Notes: For more information on pathnames, see pathname.gi.info.


Examples:
Assume that the working directory is >udd>Demo>JQUser.
