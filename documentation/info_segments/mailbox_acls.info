03/09/88  mailbox acls

In MR12.1, the message segment primitives were changed to enforce
some new restrictions on allowable mailbox and message segment
extended ACLs.  Specifically:
  1. All ACL entries containing the "r" mode must also contain "s".
  2. All ACL entries containing either "w" or "u" mode must also
     contain "a".

Since both delete_acl and set_acl always call hcs_$replace_acl,
any segments with existing ACL entries which violate the new
restrictions cannot have their ACLs changed unless these old
inconsistent ACLs are changed at the same time.


For example, an existing mailbox with the ACL:

   adrow   GDixon.SysMaint.*
   arow    Lippard.Multics.*
   aow     *.*.*

cannot be changed unless the entries for GDixon.SysMaint and
Lippard.Multics are changed at the same time.  This may be
accomplished in several ways.  With set_acl, you must specify new
modes for each of the bad ACL entries in a single command line:

   sa foo.mbx adrosw GDixon.SysMaint arosw Lippard.Multics

With delete_acl, you must delete all of the bad ACL entries in a
single command line:

   da foo.mbx GDixon.SysMaint Lippard.Multics

If there are a large number of bad ACL entries on a segment, you may
wish to delete them all and start over.  This may be easily
accomplished with the command:

   da foo.mbx ..
