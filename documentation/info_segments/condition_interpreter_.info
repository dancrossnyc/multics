:Entry: condition_interpreter_:  02/06/84 condition_interpreter_


Function: is used by subsystem condition handlers to obtain a
formatted error message for all conditions except quit, alrm, and
cput.  Some conditions do not have messages and others cause special
actions to be taken.  These are described in "Notes" below.  (For more
information on conditions, see the Programmer's Reference Manual.)


Syntax:
declare condition_interpreter_ entry (ptr, ptr, fixed bin, fixed bin,
     ptr, char(*), ptr, ptr);
call condition_interpreter_ (area_ptr, m_ptr, mlng, mode, mc_ptr,
     cond_name, wc_ptr, info_ptr);


Arguments:
area_ptr
   is a pointer to the area in which the message is to be allocated, if
   the message is to be returned.  The area size should be at least 300
   words.  If null, the message is printed on the error_output I/O
   switch.  (Input)
m_ptr
   points to the allocated message if area_ptr is not null; otherwise
   it is not set.  (Output)
mlng
   is the length (in characters) of the allocated message if area_ptr
   is not null.  If area_ptr is null, the length is not set.  Certain
   conditions (see "Notes" below) have no messages; in these cases,
   mlng is equal to 0.  (Output)


mode
   is the desired mode of the message to be printed or returned.
   (Input) It can have the following values:
   1   normal mode
   2   brief mode
   3   long mode
mc_ptr
   if not null, points to machine conditions describing the state of
   the processor at the time the condition was raised.  (Input)
cond_name
   is the name of the condition being raised.  (Input)


wc_ptr
   is usually null; but when mc_ptr points to machine conditions from
   ring 0, wc_ptr points to alternate machine conditions.  (Input)
info_ptr
   if not null, points to the information structure described in the
   Programmer's Reference Manual.  (Input)


Notes:  The following conditions cause a return with no message:

     command_error
     command_question
     finish
     stringsize
