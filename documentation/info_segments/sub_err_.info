:Info: sub_err_:  1986-09-22  sub_err_

Function: sub_err_ is called by other programs that wish to report
an unexpected situation without usurping the calling environment's
responsibility for the content of and disposition of the error message
and the choice of what to do next.  The caller specifies an identifying
message and may specify a status code.  Switches that describe whether
and how to continue execution and a pointer to further information may
also be passed to this subroutine.  The environment that invoked the
subroutine caller of sub_err_ may intercept and modify the standard
system action taken when this subroutine is called.

General purpose subsystems or subroutines, which can be called in a
variety of I/O and error handling environments, should report the
errors they detect by calling the sub_err_ subroutine.


Syntax:
declare sub_err_ entry options (variable);
call sub_err_ (code, name, flags, info_ptr, retval, ctl_string,
     ioa_args);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code describing the reason for calling the
   sub_err_ subroutine.  (Input) (It is normally declared fixed
   bin(35); but it can be any computational data type.  If not fixed
   bin(35), it will be converted to fixed bin(35)).
name
   is the name (declared as a nonvarying character string) of the
   subsystem or module on whose behalf the sub_err_ subroutine is
   called.  (Input)


flags
   describe options associated with the error.  (Input) The flags
   argument should be declared as a nonvarying bit string.  The
   following values, located in the include file
   sub_err_flags.incl.pl1, are permitted:

        ACTION_CAN_RESTART      init (""b),
        ACTION_CANT_RESTART     init ("1"b),
        ACTION_DEFAULT_RESTART  init ("01"b),
        ACTION_QUIET_RESTART    init ("001"b)
        ACTION_SUPPORT_SIGNAL   init ("0001"b)) bit (36) aligned
                                internal static options (constant);


   Each bit corresponds to one of the action flags in the standard
   condition_info_header structure, declared in
   condition_info_header.incl.pl1.  If multiple bits are on in the
   supplied string, all the specified flags are set.  See the MPM
   Reference Guide for definitions of the flags.


info_ptr
   the info_ptr argument is an aligned pointer to optional information
   specific to the situation. (Input)  This argument is used as input
   to initialize sub_error_info.info_ptr (see "Notes on the info_ptr"
   below).  The standard system environment does not use this pointer,
   but it is provided for the convenience of other environments.
retval
   is a return value from the environment to which the error was
   reported. (Input/Output)  This argument is used as input to
   initialize sub_error_info.retval (see "Notes on the info_ptr"
   below).  The standard system environment sets this value to zero.
   Other environments may set the retval argument to other values,
   which may be used to select recovery strategies.  The retval
   argument should be declared fixed bin(35).


ctl_string
   is an ioa_ format control string (declared as a nonvarying character
   string) that defines the message associated with the call to the
   sub_err_ subroutine.  (Input)  Consult the description of the ioa_
   subroutine in the MPM Subroutines.
ioa_args
   (Input) are any arguments required for conversion by the ctl_string
   argument.


Notes on prior interface:  There is an obsolete calling sequence to
this subroutine, in which the flags argument is a character string
instead of a bit string.  In that calling sequence, the legal values
are "s" for ACTION_CAN_RESTART, "h" for ACTION_CANT_RESTART, "q" for
ACTION_QUIET_RESTART, and "c" for ACTION_DEFAULT_RESTART.


Notes on operation:
The structure described below is filled in from the arguments to the
sub_err_ subroutine and the signal_ subroutine is called to raise the
sub_error_ condition.  When the standard system environment receives a
sub_error_ signal, it prints a message of the form:

   name error by sub_name|location Status code message.  Message from
      ctl_string.

The standard environment then sets retval to zero and returns, if the
value ACTION_DEFAULT_RESTART is specified; otherwise it calls the
listener.


If the start command is invoked, the standard environment returns to
sub_err_, which returns to the subroutine caller of the sub_err_
subroutine unless ACTION_CANT_RESTART is specified.  If the value
ACTION_CANT_RESTART is specified, the sub_err_ subroutine signals the
illegal_return condition.


Notes on handlers:
All handlers for the any_other condition must either pass the
sub_error_ condition on to another handler, or else must handle the
condition correctly.  Correct handling consists of printing the error
message and of respecting the cant_restart, default_restart, and
quiet_restart flags, unless the environment deliberately countermands
these actions (for example, for debugging purposes).


If an application program wishes to call a subsystem that reports
errors by the sub_err_ subroutine and wishes to replace the standard
system action for some classes of sub_err_ subroutine calls, the
application should establish a handler for the sub_error_ condition by
a PL/I on statement.  When the handler is activated as a result of a
call to the sub_err_ subroutine by some dynamic descendant, the handler
should call the find_condition_info_ subroutine to obtain the
sub_error_info_ptr that points to the structure described in "Info
Structure" below.


Notes on the info_ptr:
The structure pointed to by sub_error_ info_ptr is declared as follows
in the sub_error_info.incl.pl1 include file:

     dcl 1 sub_error_info        aligned based,
         2 header                aligned like condition_info_header,
         2 retval                fixed bin(35),
         2 name                  char(32),
         2 info_ptr              ptr;


List of elements:
header
   is a standard header required at the beginning of each
   information structure provided to an on unit.  See "Information
   Header Format" in the "MPM Reference Guide" Section 7 for further
   details.
retval
   is the return value.  The standard environment sets this value to
   zero.  Another environment handling the sub_error_ condition can
   return a different error status.  If control returns to the
   sub_err_ subroutine, the sub_error_info.retval element is returned
   to the caller as sub_err_'s retval argument.
name
   is the name of the module encountering the condition.


info_ptr
   sub_error_info.info_ptr points to additional information associated
   with the condition.  The handler should check sub_error_info.name
   and sub_error_info.code to make sure that this particular call to
   the sub_err_ subroutine is the one desired and, if not, call the
   continue_to_signal_ subroutine.  If the handler determines that
   it wishes to intercept this instance of the sub_error_ condition,
   the data pointed to can provide details specific to errors reported
   by the sub_error_info.name module.
