03/05/85  Hardcore Wait Event Identifiers

The ring-0 wait/notify protocol requires that a 36-bit identifier be
supplied to indicate the event of interest.  When a process waits,
this event identifier is specified by the process that notices that
the event has occurred (i.e., the process that notifies the event).
This info segment contains a description of all wait identifiers in
use by the system, with a brief description of each.  The identifiers
are given in octal, with ASCII interpretations where appropriate.
