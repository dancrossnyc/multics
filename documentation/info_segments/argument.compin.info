Syntax:  .ifi argument "argument" ...
      OR .ifi arg	   "argument" ...


Function:
This macro formats arguments as members of a list of arguments (see
argument_list.compin.info concerning intializing the argument list).


Macro action:
1) inserts argument separation white space as appropriate for the de-
   vice
2) formats one or more "argument"s in 10pt Helvetica Roman (also see
   Notes) undented (hanging) by one indentation level, each on a line
   by itself


NOTES:
1) A call to this macro should be followed by text describing the argu-
   ment.
2) If "argument" contains white space, it must be given as a quoted
   string.
3) "argument" may contain both literal fields and variable fields.
   These fields are distinguished in the output by presenting the vari-
   able fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italc instead of Roman.  Variable
   fields are denoted by enclosing them between tilde (~) characters.
   For example

      file~XX~

   (as might appear for some command written in FORTRAN) will present
   "file" in Roman and "XX" in Bold Italic.
