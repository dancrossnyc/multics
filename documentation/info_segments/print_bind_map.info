Syntax:  pbm path {components} {-control_args}


Function:  displays all or part of the bind map of an object segment
generated by version 4 or subsequent versions of the binder.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a bound object segment.
components
   are the optional names of one or more components of this bound
   object and/or the bindfile name.  Only the lines corresponding to
   these components are displayed.  A component name must contain one
   or more nonnumeric characters.  If it is purely numerical, it is
   assumed to be an octal offset within the bound segment, and the
   lines corresponding to the component residing at that offset are
   displayed.  A numerical component name can be specified by preceding
   it with -name.  If no component names are supplied, the entire bind
   map is displayed.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   prints the components' relocation values (also printed in the
   default brief mode), compilation times, and source languages.
-name STR, -nm STR
   is used to indicate that STR is really a component name, even though
   it appears to be an octal offset.
-no_header, -nhe
   omits all headers, printing only lines concerning the components
   themselves.
-page_offset, -pgofs
   causes the page number of the first word of the text section of each
   component to be printed as an octal number, which is the format used
   by the cumulative_page_trace command.  If the component crosses at
   least one page boundary, a plus (+) character follows the page
   number.
