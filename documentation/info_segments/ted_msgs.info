Only 2 addresses may be present.  However, there can be any number of address
prefixes (SEE ?).

An address prefix cannot have the form given.


:Info: A.u: A.u) curline undefined.

The value of "."  (curline) for a buffer becomes undefined under these
circumstances:  1) data is moved or copied into it, 2) a fileout is done into
it, 3) the last lines of a buffer are deleted, 4) a window is defined which
does not contain the current location.


:Info: Awa: Awa): Awa)g: Awa)v: Gwa: Awa) Addr- wrap-around.

The location of the second address is before that of the first.


:Info: Bgo: Bgo) Label ^a not defined in b(^a).

begin lines (otherwise they are not labels).


:Info: Bin: Bin) Incorrect buffer name.

A buffer cannot be named "," or ")".


:Info: Bin)M: Bin) Incorrect buffer name.

You are running under a limited system which does not allow the buffer request
to be used.  Therefore b(0) is the only buffer available to you.  You must use
the form M(0,address).

You are running under a limited system which does not allow the buffer request
to be used.  Therefore b(0) is the only buffer available to you.  You must use

can come about due to inadvertant over-writing of the object segment.


:Info: Cnx)|: Cnx) External symbol not found.

The |function requested was found, but did not contain the necessary point.
This can come about by adding a name to an object segment.


:Info: Cxx: Cxx) System error code.

This error code is not one of the ones normally expected.  No further
information is available about it.


:Info: Czl: Czl) Zero-length segment.

remembered for the current buffer.

pathname saved truly reflects the status of the buffer.  You must be explicit
in your intent.


:Info: Ipi: Ipi) Pathname ignored, buffer was forced to

The "^r" request has been issued in this buffer.	The name given at that time

more blanks separate sub-requests on the line.


:Info: Snb: Snb) No blank after

You are running in blank or part-blank mode.  It is required that one or more
blanks separate requests when more than one request occurs on a line.	 However,
since "r", "w", "e", "o" use up the rest of the line, then the required blank
is between the request and the rest of the line.	The requests which are under
the scope of part-blank are: a,c,i,d,r,e,w


:Info: Sne: Sne) No char for \=.

The "equals convention" of the substitute must have a character before it which
is the character to be replicated.


:Info: Snf: Snf) No routine name supplied.

The call external support routine request needs to have a name immediately
after the "|".  The name must be terminated by a " " if any arguments are to
follow or other requests can follow on same line.	 Otherwise it must be
followed by a NL.


:Info: Sqr: Sqr) q rejected.

  Whenever a buffer with an associated filename is modified, a flag is set.  It
is reset when the whole buffer is written.
  Whenever data is moved to a buffer, a flag is set on the target buffer.  It
is reset when a read is done from that buffer, or the whole buffer is invoked
(\b(X)).
  The q request checks these flags.  If any are set, warnings are printed and
the q is rejected.
Also, if the q request has any address, or is not followed by a NL, it is also
considered an error.
