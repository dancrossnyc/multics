03/06/80  convert_tsoapl_ws, ctw

Function: converts a saved workspace of IBM APL, as read into a Multics segment
by read_tsoapl_tape, into a saved workspace usable by Multics APL.
Only global names and values are converted; the state indicator (SI) is
not converted.


Syntax:  ctw tsopath {newpath}


Arguments:
tsopath
   is the pathname of the segment to be converted. The suffix sv.tsoapl
   is assumed.

newpath
   is the pathname of the segment that the converted workspace should be
   placed into. The default is to create a segment in the working
   directory with a name constructed from the first component of the
   entryname of tsopath, and a suffix of sv.apl.


Notes:  Diagnostics are printed for numeric values that cannot be converted
from IBM hexadecimal floating-point to Multics binary floating-point.
Values that are too large are replaced by the largest value; values that
are too small are replaced by the smallest value.
