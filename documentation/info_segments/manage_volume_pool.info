:Info: manage_volume_pool: mvp:  2020-06-15  manage_volume_pool, mvp

Syntax as a command:
   mvp OPERATION {args} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp OPERATION {args} {-control_args}]


Function:  allows a user or a group of users to regulate the use of a
predefined set of volumes (tape reels, etc.).  The concept of volume
sets as used with tape_ansi_/tape_ibm_ is also supported.  The default
volume pool for each user pool is named Person_id.volumes and exists in
the user's home directory.  This default can be reset via the use
operation.


Arguments:
OPERATION
   identifies the operation to be performed.  See "List of operations"
   below.
args
   are optional arguments associated with the various operations.  They
   can be names of volumes to be acted upon according to the operation
   given.


List of operations:

   then reallocates them for a new use, again changing their state to
   "allocated".


set
   changes the comment or expiration date fields of selected volume
   sets.
test
   tests whether selected volume sets are in a given state.

   sets pathname of volume pool to be used in subsequent mvp commands
   in the current process.


Control arguments:
-control_args
   vary by operation being performed.  For detail on a particular
   operation, type:  help mvp.OPERATION


Notes on expiration dates:
There are two kinds of expiration dates.  One is associated with the
physical volume and is referenced with -pv_expire.  Physical volume
expiration dates are useful for keeping track of old and bad tapes.

The pv_expire date is checked whenever the volume state is changed to
freed, allocated, or reserved, or when a volume is removed from or
appended to another volume set.  When the current date reaches the
pv_expire date of a volume in the set, such operations notice that the
pv_expire date has passed.  The state of that volume set changes to
expired and the user is notified.  The date is not checked when the
reuse operation is performed.

Such expired volume sets can only be deleted or freed from the volume
pool; if freed, the expiration date can be reset using the set key.


The other optional expiration date applies only to an entire allocated
volume sets.  It is referenced by -expire and refers to the time when
the information on the volume set is considered no longer relevant.

This date can be set at allocation time.  When the volume set is
freed, the expire date field is cleared.  This expire date is useful
for keeping track of recycling volume sets.  There is no state
associated with this expire date.

Both kinds of expiration dates have to be explicitly set by the user
via control arguments or the set key.  If not set, the default is for
volume sets never to expire.


Notes on querying:
The user is asked whether to continue a requested action (allocate,
reserve, etc.) when the action can only be performed on some but not
all volume names specified.  The -force control argument can be used
to override the query.  If the user answers "no," the entire request
is aborted and no action is taken.  If the user replies "yes" to the
query or -force is used, the request is performed on the volume sets
eligible and a message is printed listing the volume sets on which no
action was taken.


Notes on active function:
When mvp is invoked as an active function, a successful action returns
"true", a list of volume names, or pathnames, depending on the actual
operation being performed.  In the case of a partial success when an
attempt to query the user is made, active_fnc_err_ is called; however,
its action is overridden when -force or -fexp is used.  This results
in returning "true" or the partial list of volume names successfully
acted upon.


:Info: mvp.add: mvp.a:  2020-06-15  mvp add operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp a VOL_NAMEs {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp a VOL_NAMEs {-control_args}]


Function: adds selected volumes to the user's volume pool.  Each
volume added is considered a volume set of size one.


Arguments:
add, a
   is the operation being performed.
VOL_NAME
   label of a volume being added to the pool.  Several physical
   volumes may be added by one command.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   adds the volumes it can without aborting the entire request or
   querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on Querying").
-pv_expire DATE, -pvexp DATE
   sets the expiration date of all given physical volumes to DATE.
   DATE must be acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_.  (See mvp.info
   "Notes on expiration dates".)


Notes: Failure can occur when the volume to be added already exists in
the volume pool.

As an active function, "true" is returned if all volumes were
successfully added.


:Info: mvp.allocate: mvp.alloc:  2020-06-15  mvp allocate operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp alloc {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp alloc {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}]


Function: allocates the selected free or reserved volume sets by
changing their state to "allocated" (in-use).

As an active function, the allocated VOL_NAMEs are returned.


Arguments:
allocate, alloc
   is the operation being performed.


Arguments for volume selection:
   The VOLUME_SELECTION argument gives specific VOL_NAMEs; or gives
   zero, one, or two volume selector control arguments.
VOL_NAMEs
   name of one or more specific freed or reserved volume sets to be
   allocated.  The argument can be the label of a primary or secondary
   volume in the volume set.  Several names may be given to select
   multiple sets as one allocation.  Reserved volume sets must be
   specified by their VOL_NAME.


Control arguments for volume selection:
   Selects free or reserved volume sets based on their attributes:
   -volume_size selects a volume set having a given number of volumes;
   and -first selects from most-recently-freed volume sets while -last
   selects from least-recently-freed volume sets.  If neither
   VOL_NAMEs nor volume selection control args are given, the default
   is -last 1.
-volume_size {N}, -vs {N}
   allocates a volume set of size N.  If N is not given, the default
   size is 1.  If there are no volume sets of size N, an error message
   occurs.  The test operation can be used to avoid such errors.
   If more than one volume set of size N exists and neither -first nor
   -last is used, then the last free (least recently freed) volume set
   of size N is assigned.  If -vs is not given, the default action is
   to consider volume sets of any size in the pool.


-first {N}, -ft {N}
   allocates N most-recently-freed volume sets in the pool (freed
   volume sets that have the most recent state change date).
   (default for N: 1)
-last {N}, -lt {N}
   allocates N least-recently-freed volume sets in the pool.
   (default for N: 1)


Control arguments:
-comment STR, -com STR
   designates STR as the comment  associated with the chosen
   vol_names.
-expire DATE, -exp DATE
   sets the expiration date associated with the data on the
   allocated vol_names.  (See mvp.info "Notes on expiration dates").
-force, -fc
   assigns the volume sets it can without aborting the entire
   request or querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on querying").


Notes:
Failure can occur if the volume sets to be allocated do not exist in
the volume pool, if they are not in the free or reserve state, or if N
free volume sets are requested and fewer than N freed volume sets
exist in the pool.


:Info: mvp.append_volume_set: mvp.appvs:  2020-06-15  mvp append_volume_set operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp appvs PRIMARY_VOL_NAME {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp appvs PRIMARY_VOL_NAME {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}]


Function: appends volumes identified by the VOLUME_SELECTION to the
volume set specified by the PRIMARY_VOL_NAME.  The pv_expire date of
each volume is checked before appending; if this date has passed (i.e,
is less than the current date), the state of the volume becomes
expired, a message to that effect is printed, and the volume is not
appended.

As an active function, the volume names that were appended to the
volume set are returned.  If a multiple volume set is appended, all
the volumes in the set are returned.


Arguments:
append_volume_set, appvs
   is the operation to be performed.
PRIMARY_VOL_NAME
   is the label of the primary volume of the set to be extended.


Arguments for volume selection:
   The VOLUME_SELECTION argument gives specific VOL_NAMEs; or gives
   zero, one, or two volume selector control arguments.
VOL_NAMEs
   primary volume of one or more free volume sets to be appended;
   VOL_NAME cannot be a secondary volume of another volume set.  The
   pv_expire date of each VOL_NAME is checked before appending; if the
   date has passed (i.e., less than the current date), the state of
   the volume becomes expired, a message is printed to that effect,
   and the volume is not appended.


Control arguments for volume selection:
   Selects free volume sets based on their attributes: -volume_size
   selects a volume set having a given number of volumes; and -first
   selects most-recently-freed volume sets while -last selects from
   least-recently-freed volume sets.  If neither VOL_NAMEs nor volume
   selection control args are given, the default is -last 1 (one
   volume set that has been in the freed state for the longest time).
-volume_size {N}, -vs {N}
   appends a volume set of size N.  If N is not given, the default
   size is 1.  If more than one volume set of size N exists and
   neither -first nor -last is used, then the least-recently-freed
   volume set of size N is appended.  If there are no volume sets of
   size N, an error message occurs.  The test operation can be used to
   avoid such errors.  If -vs is not given, the default action is to
   consider volume sets of any size in the pool.


-first {N}, -ft {N}
   appends N most-recently-freed volume sets in the pool (freed volume
   sets that have the most recent state change date).
   (default for N: 1)
-last {N}, -lt {N}
   appends N least-recently-freed volume sets in the pool.
   (default for N: 1)


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   appends the volumes it can without aborting the entire request or
   querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on querying").


Notes: The vol_names argument and -ft, -lt, or -vs are mutually
exclusive.  If -vs is not chosen, the default action is to consider
volume sets of any size in the pool.

Failure can occur when a given volume set does not exist or when a
volume to be appended is not free.


:Info: mvp.delete: mvp.dl:  2020-06-15  mvp delete operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp dl VOL_NAMEs {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp dl VOL_NAMEs {-control_arg}]


Function: deletes the specified physical volume sets from the current
volume pool.  Volume sets must be in the freed, reserved, or
expired state to be deleted.

As an active function, a successful delete returns "true"; an
unsuccessful delete returns "false".


Arguments:
delete, dl
   is the operation being performed.
VOL_NAME
   is a label that identifies a volume set to be deleted.  If VOL_NAME
   is part of a multiple volume set, all volumes in the set are
   deleted from the pool; if it is a secondary_vol_name, the volume
   set to which the secondary volume belongs is deleted.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   deletes the volume sets it can without aborting the entire
   request or querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on Querying").


:Info: mvp.free:  2020-06-15  mvp free operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp free VOLUME_SELECTION {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp free VOLUME_SELECTION {-control_args}]


Function:
Changes the state of volume sets in the current volume pool to
"freed".  Upon freeing a volume set, the pv_expire date of each volume
in the set is checked; if one of these dates is passed, the state of
the volume set becomes expired and a message to that effect is
printed.

In the case of an allocated volume to be freed, the expire date is
checked first; if this date has not passed, the volume set is not
freed and a message to that effect is printed.

As an active function, a successful free returns "true," otherwise
"false" is returned.


Arguments:
free
   is the operation being performed.


Arguments for volume selection:
   The VOLUME_SELECTION argument gives specific VOL_NAMES; or gives a
   volume selector control argument to select volume sets.  Either
   VOL_NAMEs may be given, or one of the selectors: -expire -match
   -force.
VOL_NAMEs
   names of one or more specific volume sets to be freed.  If VOL_NAME
   is part of a multiple volume set, all volumes in the set are freed;
   if it is a secondary_vol_name, the volume set to which the
   secondary volume belongs is freed.


Control arguments for volume selection:
   Selects volume sets based on their attributes.  Either VOL_NAMEs
   may be given, or one of the selectors: -expire -match -force.
-expire, -exp
   frees all allocated volume sets for which the respective
   expiration date has been passed.
-match STR
   frees only those volume sets whose comment contains STR as a
   substring.  The volume sets can be in the allocated, reserved, or
   expired state.  Both expirations dates are first checked before
   freeing the volume sets.
-force, -fc
   frees the volume sets it can without aborting the entire request
   or querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on querying").


Control arguments:
-force_expire, -fexp
   overrides the checking of the expire date when -match is given,
   freeing allocated volume sets with an unexpired expiration date.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the pv_expire message or the allocation expire message
   when appropriate.

Syntax as a command: mvp ls {VOL_NAMEs} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function: [mvp ls {VOL_NAMEs} {-control_args}]


Function: lists information about the specified volume sets or about
all volume sets in the pool if no arguments are supplied.  The list is
printed in state change date order with the volumes whose states
changed most recently listed first.

As an active function, list with no control arguments returns a list
of the primary volume names of all volume sets; otherwise, the control
arguments determine the field(s) returned for each selected volume.


Arguments:
list, ls
   the operation being performed.
VOL_NAME
   name of a volume whose attributes are displayed.  (default: display
   all volumes)


Control arguments:

   prints the header information of the list display.  (default)
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.
-total, -tt
   prints the total number of volume sets in the pool.


Control arguments for field selection:
   These control arguments determine which fields are displayed.

   lists only those volume sets that are reserved.


Control arguments for volume attribute selection:
   These control arguments allow one to list volume sets by criteria
   other than the volume state or in combination with the volume state
   control arguments.  The default format display is used unless field
   arguments are given.  This control arguments are mutually exclusive
   with specific VOL_NAME arguments.
-expire, -exp
   lists allocated volume sets if their expiration date has been
   passed.

   the operation being performed.


:Info: mvp.pv_expire: mvp.pvexp:  2020-06-15  mvp pv_expire operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp pvexp VOL_NAMEs {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp pvexp VOL_NAMEs {-control_args}]


Function: changes the state of the selected volume sets and their
secondary volumes to "expired".  The set key can be used to reset
the physical volume expiration date.  Volume sets cannot be in the
allocated state.  If vol_name is a secondary_vol_name, the state of the
volume set to which the secondary volume belongs becomes "expired".

The active function returns "true" if all indicated VOL_NAMEs are
successfully expired; "false" otherwise.


Arguments:
pv_expire, pvexp
   the operation being performed.
VOL_NAMEs
   name of one or more volume sets to be changed to "expired" state.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   expires the volume sets it can without aborting the entire
   request or querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on querying").


:Info: mvp.remove_volume_set: mvp.rmvs:  2020-06-15  mvp remove_volume_set operation


Syntax as a command:
 mvp rmvs PRIMARY_VOL_NAME SECONDARY_VOLUME_SELECTION {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
[mvp rmvs PRIMARY_VOL_NAME SECONDARY_VOLUME_SELECTION {-control_args}]


Function:
Removes volumes identified by SECONDARY_VOLUME_SELECTION from the
volume set named PRIMARY_VOL_NAME.  The volumes removed are placed in
the pool as volume sets of size 1 in the free state.

The primary volume of a volume set cannot be removed unless -all is
used.

If the volume set supplied is in the allocated state, the expire date
is checked first.  If this date has not passed, the request is aborted
and a message is printed.

Upon freeing each volume, its pv_expire date is checked; if this date
is passed, the state of the volume changes to "expired" and a message
to that effect is printed.


As an active function, the vol_names removed from the volume set are
returned.


Arguments:
remove_volume_set, rmvs
   the operation being performed.
PRIMARY_VOL_NAME
   name of the primary volume which identifies the volume set from
   which individual volumes are removed.


Arguments for secondary volume selection:
   The SECONARY_VOLUME_SELECTION arguments gives specific
   SECONDARY_VOL_NAMEs; or gives one of the secondary volume selection
   control arguments.
SECONDARY_VOL_NAMEs
   names of other volumes to be removed from the selected volume set.


Control arguments for secondary volume selection:
   One of the following must be given if SECONDARY_VOLUME_NAMEs are
   omitted.
-all, -a
   breaks the volume set into individual volume sets of size 1, each
   with a state of "freed" (or "expired", as explained above); this
   state change also occurs for the primary volume of the set.
-pv_expire, -pvexp
   removes all volumes of the designated volume set whose pv_expire
   date has been passed, and puts them in the pool with the
   "expired" state.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the pv_expire message or the volume-not-removed
   message when appropriate.
-force, -fc
   removes the volumes it can without aborting the entire request or
   querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on querying").
-force_expire, -fexp
   overrides the checking of the expire date, freeing allocated
   volume sets with an unexpired expiration date.


Notes:
Failure can occur when the volumes to be removed do not exist in the
volume set.


:Info: mvp.reserve: mvp.rsv:  2020-06-15  mvp reserve operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp rsv {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp rsv {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}]


Function:
Reserves the indicated free volume sets for allocation by the current
process.  If VOL_NAME is a secondary volume name of a volume set, its
containing volume set is reserved.

Only a free volume set can be reserved.  A reserved volume set may be
allocated only by the process that successfully reserved that volume
set.

Whenever an allocation is attempted for reserved volume, a check is
made to see if the process that made the reservation is still active;
if not, its reservation is cancelled and the volume can be allocated
by the requesting process.


When reserving, the pv_expire date is checked; if this date has
passed, the state of the volume set becomes "expired" and message
explains why the reservation failed.

As an active function, a list of the volume set names reserved is
returned.


Arguments:
reserve, rsv
   the operation being performed.


Arguments for volume selection:
   The VOLUME_SELECTION argument gives specific VOL_NAMEs; or gives
   zero, one, or two volume selector control arguments.
VOL_NAMEs
   name of one or more specific freed volume sets to be reserved.  The
   argument can be the label of a primary or secondary volume in the
   volume set.  Several names may be given to select multiple sets as
   one reservation.


Control arguments for volume selection:
   Selects free volume sets based on their attributes: -volume_size
   selects a volume set having a given number of volumes; and -first
   selects from most-recently-freed volume sets while -last selects
   from least-recently-freed volume sets.  If neither VOL_NAMEs nor
   volume selection control arguments are given, the default is
   -last 1 (one value set that has been freed for the longest time).
-volume_size {N}, -vs {N}
   reserves a volume set of size N.  If more than one volume set of
   size N exists and neither -first nor -last is given, then the
   last free volume set of size N is reserved.  (default for N: 1)
   If no volume set of size N exists, an error message occurs.  The
   test key can be used to avoid such errors.


-first {N}, -ft {N}
   reserves N most-recently-freed volume sets. (default for N: 1)
-last {N}, -lt {N}
   reserves N least-recently-freed volume sets. (default for N: 1)


Control arguments:
-comment STR, -com STR
   changes the comment associated with the reserved volume set to be
   STR.
-force, -fc
   reserves the volumes it can without aborting the entire request
   or querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on querying").


Notes:
Failure can occur if the specified vol_names to be reserved do not
exist, if they are not in the free state, if no volume set of size N
exists, or if there are only N free volumes in the pool and N+1
volumes are selected to be reserved.


:Info: mvp.reuse:  2020-06-15  mvp reuse operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp reuse {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp reuse {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}]


Function: allows one to free and reallocate a designated number of
allocated volume sets, without needing to know their volume names.
Before this operation is performed, the expire date is checked; if
this date has not passed, the request is not performed and a
message is printed.

As an active function, the primary names of the volume sets that were
reused are returned.


Arguments:
reuse
   the operation being performed.


Arguments for volume selection:
   The VOLUME_SELECTION argument gives specific VOL_NAMEs; or gives
   zero, one, or two volume selector control arguments.
VOL_NAMEs
   name of one or more specific allocated volume sets to be freed and
   reused.  The argument can be the label of a primary or secondary
   volume in the volume set.  Several names may be given to select
   multiple sets as one re-allocation.


Control arguments for volume selection:
   Selects allocated volume sets based on their attributes:
   -volume_size selects a volume set having a given number of volumes;
   and -first selects from most-recently-freed volume sets while -last
   selects from least-recently-freed volume sets; and -match selects
   only from volume sets whose comment contains STR.  If neither
   VOL_NAMEs nor volume selection control args are given, the default
   is -last 1.
-volume_size {N}, -vs {N}
   reallocates a volume set of size N. (default for N: 1)  If there
   are no volume sets of size N, an error message occurs.  If more
   than one volume set of size N exists and neither -first nor -last
   is used, then the oldest allocated (least recently allocated) volume
   set of size N is assigned.  If -vs is not given, the default action
   is to consider volume sets of any size in the pool.


-first {N}, -ft {N}
   reallocates N most-recently-allocated volume sets in the pool
   (allocated volume sets that have the most recent state change
   date). (default for N: 1)
-last {N}, -lt {N}
   reallocates N least-recently-allocated volume sets in the pool.
   (default for N: 1)
-match STR
   reallocates all volume sets whose comment contains the string
   STR.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the reuse request message not performed.
-force, -fc
   reuses the volume sets it can without aborting the entire request
   or querying the user (see mvp.info "Notes on Querying").
-force_expire, -fexp
   overrides the checking of the expire date and reallocates the
   specified volume sets with an unexpired expiration date.


Notes:
Failure can occur if N allocated volume sets are requested and fewer
than N allocated volume sets meeting specifications exist in the pool.

   the operation being performed.
VOL_NAMEs
   name of one or more volumes in the pool.  Interpretation of
   VOL_NAME varies for each of the control arguments below.


Control arguments:
-comment STR, -com STR
   sets the comment field of the designated VOL_NAMEs to STR.  If
   the volume name is secondary, the comment field of the volume set
   to which it belongs is changed.
-expire DATE, -exp DATE
   sets the expiration date associated with allocated VOL_NAMEs
   selected.  The selected volumes must be in the allocated state,
   otherwise an error message is printed.  If a secondary volume
   name is given, the expire date of the allocated volume set
   containing that secondary volume is changed.  The DATE must be
   acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_.  (See mvp.info
   "Notes on Expiration Dates.")


-pv_expire DATE, -pvexp DATE
   sets the physical volume expiration date of the specified
   VOL_NAMEs to DATE.  The volume set state does not change to
   "expired" until the next state change operation is attempted
   (via the alloc, free, and rsv keys) after that DATE is reached.
   If the volume name is primary, the expiration date is reset to DATE
   for only that primary volume unless followed by -secondary_volumes.
   Secondary volumes of a volume set can be selected individually to
   set their pv_expire date.  (See mvp.info "Notes on Expiration
   Dates.")
-secondary_volumes, -svol
   is used in conjunction with -pvexp to indicate that the secondary
   volumes of the primary volume name preceeding -svol should also be
   set to the given pv_expire date.


-state_date DATE, -stdt DATE
   sets the date associated with the volume state for the selected
   volumes.  If the volume name is primary, the expiration date is
   set for all secondary volumes as well.


:Info: mvp.test:  2020-06-15  mvp test operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp test {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp test {VOLUME_SELECTION} {-control_args}]


Function: tests what state the specified volume sets are in.

As an active function, "true" is returned if a volume set with the
state specified is found in the pool.


Arguments:
test
   the operation being performed.


Arguments for volume selection:
   The VOLUME_SELECTION argument gives specific VOL_NAMEs; or gives
   volume selection control arguments which select volume sets to
   test.
VOL_NAMEs
   name of one or more specific volume sets to be tested.  If the
   VOL_NAME is a secondary volume, the attributes of the volume set
   containing that volume are tested.


Control arguments for volume selection:
   Selects volume sets based on their attributes.  These control
   arguments are mutually exclusive with VOL_NAME arguments.
-first {N}, -ft {N}
   tests for N volume sets in the given or default state with the
   most-recently-changed state date.  (default for N: 1)
-last {N}, -lt {N}
   tests for N volume sets in the given or default state with the
   least-recently-changed state date.  (default for N: 1)
   Failure can occur when N volume sets are requested and fewer than N
   volume sets in the test state are found in the pool.
-match STR
   tests all volume sets whose comment contains the substring STR.


-volume_size {N}, -vs {N}
   tests all volume sets of size N volumes.  (default for N: 1)  If no
   volume set of size N exists, an error message is returned.


Control arguments for testing state:
-allocate, -alloc
   tests whether any volume sets or vol_names selected are in the
   allocated state.
-free
   tests whether any volume sets or vol_names given are in the freed
   state. (default)
-pv_expire, -pvexp
   tests whether any volume sets or vol_names specified are in the
   expired state.
-reserve, -rsv
   tests whether any volume sets or vol_names selected are in the
   reserved state.


Notes: The vol_names argument and -ft, -lt, -match, or -vs are
mutually exclusive.  If -vs is not given, the default action is to
consider all volume sets of any size in the pool.


:Info: mvp.use: mvp.u:  2020-06-15  mvp use operation


Syntax as a command:
   mvp u {PATH}


Syntax as an active function:
  [mvp u {PATH}]


Function: specifies the pathname of the mvp segment to be used by
future invocations of mvp in this process.

As an active function, the pathname is returned.


Arguments:
use, u
   the operation being performed.
PATH
   The pathname of a volume pool to be used by subsequent mvp commands
   in this process.  The "volumes" suffix is assumed. (default: the
   user's default volume pool, [home_dir]>[user name].volumes )  If
   the given segment is not found, a new volume pool is created.
