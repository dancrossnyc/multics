pgs A-2, A-7, A-54:  add the following Note at the end of the
     ARGUMENTS sections for "print_mail", "read_mail" and
     "send_mail."

     Note:  if the mbx_specification (mbx_specification address)
     is a pathname, and that pathname does not contain a "<" or
     ">" character, read_mail (send_mail, print_mail) searches
     for the pathname using the mail_system search list.  The
     default content of the search list is the following:

         -working_dir
         -home_dir
         >udd>[user_project]>[user name]>[user name].mlsys


A-27, A-73:  under "exec_com path {args}" change the search list
     from

     -working_dir
     >udd>[user_project]>[user name]>[user name].mlsys

   to

     -working_dir
     -home_dir
     >udd>[user_project]>[user name]>[user name].mlsys
