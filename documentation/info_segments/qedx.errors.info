Description

0016  phx17590 phx18344
 If the user types an input/request line longer than 512 characters,
 qedx will overwrite parts of the stack causing subsequent faults or
 fatal process errors.

0011  phx16226
 The "wake_tbl" tty_ mode, which causes the user's process to only
 be awoken when a "\" is typed, is not reset if the current buffer
 overflows (ie:  exceeds 1044480 characters) during input.

0010  phx15534 phx15664
 qedx should not create files whose names require the use of quoting
 or special control arguments (eg: rename's "-name") as the
 manipulation of such files pose severe problems for naive (and not
 so naive) users.  Thus, qedx should reject the use of whitespace,
 command language characters ("()[];), starname characters (*?),
 and equalname characters (=%) when creating a new file.

0009  phx15606
 qedx ignores empty buffers when deciding whether to ask for permis-
 sion to exit with modified buffers.  However, the list of
 modified buffers displayed in the query includes empty buffers.
 Empty buffers should not be listed.  This is a bug because a user
 will not be able to reset the modified state of these buffers as
 qedx does not allow the user to write an empty buffer but the
 empty buffers will continue to be listed as long as there is one
 non-empty, modified buffer.

0008  phx15457 phx19279
 Given the following sequence of qedx requests:
      r FILE
      b(other) $a \b(0) \f
 the text appended to buffer "other" will not contain the contents
 of the file that was just read into buffer "0".

0007  phx15204 phx18060
 Given the following sequence of requests in an empty buffer:
      .r FILE
      1p 1,$d
      .r FILE
      1p 1,$d
      .r FILE
      1p
 the first read request will execute properly.  However, the second
 read request will insert a NUL at the beginning of the file as
 seen by the print request.  The third and subsequent read requests
 will insert a newline at the beginning of the file.
