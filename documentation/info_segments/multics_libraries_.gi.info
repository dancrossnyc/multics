:Info: multics_libraries_.gi: multics_libraries_:  1983-08-22  multics_libraries_

This data base is the library descriptor for the Multics System
Libraries.  Like all library descriptors, it defines: the roots of
the libraries, the names by which these roots can be referenced in
library descriptor commands, and the default library names and search
names used by each of the library descriptor commands when operating
on the Multics System Libraries.

For detailed information on the Multics Libraries, see the Multics
Library Maintenance manual (AN80).


The Multics System Libraries:
The Multics System is composed of the "logical libraries" containing
Multics programs.  Each library is, in turn, composed of several
directories containing the different kinds of library entries (source
and object segments; bind files; info and include segments;
multisegment files).  A library descriptor command can reference an
entire logical library by name, or it can reference one or more of
its directories.

The logical library structure does not map directly onto the physical
library organization in the Multics storage system.  However, the
library descriptor tools can reference all of the physical libraries
by logical library name.


List of libraries:
standard_library, std, sss
   Standard software for use by users.
unbundled_library, unb
   Separately-priced software products.
tools_library, tools, t
   System administration and maintenance tools.
hardcore, hard, h
   Multics ring-0 supervisor programs.
privileged, priv
   Library containing help files for privileged administrative,
   maintenance, and operator commands.
subsystem_library, ss
   Library containing help files for some Multics subsystems.


communications_library, com, mcs
   Multics Front-end Network Processor (FNP) software and firmware.
obsolete_library, obsolete, obs
   Earlier versions of some Multics programs.


List of directories in libraries:
   Each of the above libraries may contain one or more of the
   following logical directories.
source, s
   Program source files and source archives.
object, o
   Program object files, bind files, and bound object archives.
execution, x
   Executable bound and unbound programs, gates, and data files.
info
   Information segments (help files).
include, incl
   Program include files.
lists, l
   Program compilation listings.


Library Names:
One or more libraries or directories may be referenced in a library
descriptor command by giving the appropriate combinations of library
and directory names in a two-component LIBRARY_NAME.  Examples are:
   sss.source  sss.include  sss.info  priv.info

For details about a library descriptor such as
multics_libraries_, see the library_descriptor (lds) command.
