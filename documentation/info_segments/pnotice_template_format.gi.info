Pnotice  templates  provide the text of protection notices to be placed
in  software  modules.   Honeywell  provides  templates  for protecting
Multics software.  Customers can protect their own software by creating
templates  containing  the  text  of their company's copyright or trade
secret  protection  notices,  according  to  the  rules  below.   These
templates  can be placed in >tools, along with the Honeywell templates;
or  they can be placed in a separate directory which can be accessed by
modifying the pnotice search paths.


Constructing template names:  Template names are constructed according
to the following rules:

  1.  Each copyright notice has a multiple component name, whose last
      component is the suffix pnotice.  For example, HIS.pnotice.

  2.  Each trade secret notice has a multiple component name, whose
      last two components are trade_secret.pnotice.  For example,
      HIS.trade_secret.pnotice.

  3.  The public domain notice has the name public_domain.pnotice.


  4.  A protection notice for a single company (a single party
      protection notice) should have a first component of the
      form PARTY_NAME{_OPTIONAL_VERSION}.  For example, an
      alternate version of the Honeywell copyright notice would
      be named HIS_A.pnotice.  An alternate version of the trade
      secret notice would be HIS_A.trade_secret.pnotice.
      Alternate version names are needed whenever the text,
      capitalization or punctuation of a protection notice
      differs from that of the primary notice (the notice which
      has no optional version in its name).


  5.  In general, each protection notice may have only one name.
      The except is for the default copyright and trade secret
      pnotices.  They have two names.  The primary name follows
      the rules above.  The second name for the default copyright
      notice (the notice used when -default_copyright is given)
      is default_copyright.pnotice.  The second name for the
      default trade secret notice (the notice used when
      -default_trade_secret is given) is
      default.trade_secret.pnotice.


Creating  pnotice  templates:  Pnotice  segments  are  ASCII  templates
containing  the  text of a software protection notice.  The contents of
the template segments must conform to the following rules:

  1.   The  template  must  contain  the  exact  text of the protection
       notice,  including  proper  capitalization  of  words  and
       punctuation, except  that  copyright notices must contain <yr>
       in place of an actual year number.

  2.   A  copyright  notice  must contain the word "Copyright", with
       an initial  capital  letter.   A trade secret notice must
       contain the word "PROPRIETARY",  all  upper case.  The public
       domain notice must contain the words "PUBLIC DOMAIN", all upper
       case.


  3.   No  lines  in  the  template  may  begin  or end with
       whitespace characters  (space, horizontal or vertical tab, or
       newpage characters).  Each line should end with a single
       newline character.

  4.   The template must not contain blank lines.

  5.   No line may contain a horizontal tab, or an asterisk (*).

  6.   No line may be longer than 71 characters.


Using   customer   created   pnotices:   To   facilitate   the  use  of
customer-created protection notices, the following steps are suggested:

     1.   Place templates containing the  protection notices in a
          site-maintained or user-maintained directory.

     2.   Change the pnotice search list to reference that directory.
          A  site-maintained  directory can be included in the default
          pnotice search  list by changing search_list_defaults_.cds
          and reinstalling the resultant  object segment.  A
          user-maintained directory can be included by adding it to the
          pnotice search list.


     3.   After     new    templates     are    installed,    use
          list_pnotice_names -check  -all to check  for errors in
          the  new templates.   list_pnotice_names will  not list
          pnotice  templates which  have errors  unless -check is
          given.  It suppresses such errors when -check is omitted
          because most users will not  have access to correct the
          errors.


Pnotice  usage rules:
A  copyright  notice  protects the form, contents, and structure of the
protected  software  by  legally  granting to the copyright owner for a
limited period the exclusive rights to software.  All copyright notices
must  follow  the  ten-year-rule.   That is, if a notice is ten or more
years  old, a new notice with the current date should be added.  If the
current notice is less than 10 years old, no new notice can be added.

The  trade  secret  notice is an expression of the restrictions on use.
Each  software module may have one or more trade secret notices.  These
notices should not include a year, since there is no legal limit on the
number of years that the trade secret may be protected.


A  public  domain  notice  is  an  explicit statement that the software
resides  in  the  public  domain,  is  available for anyone to use, and
cannot  be protected via copyright or trade secret laws.  There is only
one   public  domain  notice  recognized  by  the  software  protection
programs, called public_domain.pnotice.


Examples of pnotices:
An example of a Honeywell copyright notice is:

   Copyright, (C) Honeywell Information Systems Inc., <yr>

The notice consists of a single line of text, with no blank lines
or lines  with leading or  trailing whitespace.

An  example of a trade secret notice is:

   HONEYWELL CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

An example of the public domain notice is:

   This is the PUBLIC DOMAIN and may be copied without permission
