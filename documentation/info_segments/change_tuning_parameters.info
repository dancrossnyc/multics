Syntax: ctp name1 value1 {... nameN valueN} {-control_args}


Function: changes the values of system tuning parameters.


Arguments:
name
   is the name of a tuning parameter whose value is to be changed.  It
   can be either the long or short name of the parameter.
value
   is the representation of the value the tuning parameter is to be set
   to. It may be an integer, a decimal number of seconds, either of
   "on" or "off", a decimal number, or a full-word octal value.  The
   data type of the value depends on the individual tuning parameter
   being set.


Control arguments:
-silent
   causes the message normally printed on the operators console to
   announce the change to only be logged.  This control argument can
   only be used in the Initializer process.


Access required: This procedure requires access to metering_gate_ and
hphcs_, or to metering_gate_ and initializer_gate_ if -silent was
specified.


Notes: This procedure always prints the requested change and asks
for verification. This can be suppressed by using the answer command.
If the new value supplied is unacceptable to the hardcore for some
reason, an error message containing the explanation is printed.

See the Multics System Metering, Order No. AN52, for a complete list of
available tuning parameters.
