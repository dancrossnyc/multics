:Entry:  get_seg_usage:  02/03/84 mhcs_$get_seg_usage


Function:  This entry point returns the number of page faults taken on
a segment since its creation.


Syntax:
declare mhcs_$get_seg_usage entry (char(*), char(*), fixed bin(35),
     fixed bin(35));
call mhcs_$get_seg_usage (dir_name, entryname, use, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the directory containing the segment.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entry name of the segment.  (Input)
use
   is the page fault count.  (Output)
code

:Entry:  get_seg_usage_ptr:  02/03/84 mhcs_$get_seg_usage_ptr


Function:  This entry point works the same as mhcs_$get_seg_usage
except that it takes a pointer to the segment.


Syntax:
declare mhcs_$get_seg_usage_ptr entry (ptr, fixed bin(35),
     fixed bin(35));
call mhcs_$get_seg_usage_ptr (s_ptr, use, code);


Arguments:
s_ptr
   is a pointer to the segment.  (Input)
use
   is the page fault count.  (Output)
code
