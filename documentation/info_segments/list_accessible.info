Syntax as a command:  lac {path {User_id}} {-control_args}


Function:	 scans a directory and lists segments, multisegments, files,
and directories with a specified access for a specified User_id.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory to be scanned.  If path is omitted
   or -wd is specified, the working directory is scanned.
User_id
   is an access control name.  It can have null components.  The star
   convention is allowed.  See the description of set_acl in this
   manual.  If User_id is omitted, the User_id of the calling process
   with a star tag is assumed.


Control arguments:
-dir_mode STR
   lists directories to which the named user(s) has any of the modes
   specified in STR, where STR can be any or all of the letters sma.
-seg_mode STR
   lists segments to which the named user(s) has any of the modes
   specified in STR, where STR can be any or all of the letters rew.


Access required:  The user must have status (s) permission on the
directory.


Notes:
You can't use User_id unless you have first supplied a path.

If no control arguments are specified, all the segments and
directories to which the named user(s) has nonnull access are listed.

If there can be more than one User_id (i.e., the specified
User_id has null components), the modes for each matched User_id
and the matched User_id are listed on a per entry basis.
