01/09/87  Multics Online Work Station Environment, MOWSE


Function: The Multics Online Work Station Environment (MOWSE) provides
the means for two computers (the PC and Multics in this case) to
communicate with each other and to exchange requests for information
or processing.

Background
If you are a Multics user with an IBM Personal Computer, you have
access to two complete systems.  The capabilities of each system are
determined by the hardware resources known to the system, and on the
software directing those resources.  Programs running on Multics use
the resources known to Multics to accomplish their tasks, and
programs running on the PC use the resources known to the PC to
complete theirs.


It is possible to connect the PC to Multics without MOWSE.  In this
case, the PC assumes the role of a terminal connected to Multics.
The PC takes on the capabilities of a terminal, and all other PC
capabilities are unknown.  Programs running on Multics use only the
capabilities of the PC as a terminal to complete their function.  As
a terminal emulator, the PC loses its status as a system, leaving
many of the PC capabilities inaccessible.  To use the PC as a
Personal Computer, you must escape back to the PC, and quit the
terminal emulator.  You are now free to run programs on the PC.
Such programs use only the resources of the PC, and do not make use
of the powerful system at the other end of the line, Multics.


The MOWSE environment:

A more powerful environment incorporates the two systems, with each
system acting as a resource to the other.  Programs running in the
environment are able to access the larger resource pool, and may:

     (1) perform tasks that were not previously possible, and

     (2) choose the system on which the task is best performed.


Although MOWSE by itself does not supply a Multics/PC user with any
additional abilities, it provides the framework within which programs
(called MOWSE Applications) can be written which use the capabilities
of both systems.

The primary function provided by MOWSE is the ability to support
background applications in addition to and at the same time as
foreground applications.  In other words, it allows limited
multi-tasking to take place.  For example, the MOWSE application BFT
(Background File Transfer), allows you to transfer files from the PC
to Multics (or vice versa) in the background, while working on some
other activity on the PC or Multics in the foreground.  Generally
speaking, the environment allows one activity to proceed in the
background (without user-input or screen output) while you are active
on something else in the foreground (where input and output is taking
place).


MOWSE Concepts:

MOWSE Application

A program written to run in MOWSE, which uses capabilities on both
the PC and Multics.  All background programs must be MOWSE
applications; foreground programs may be MOWSE or non-MOWSE
applications.

Background Application

A program that runs in the MOWSE environment (BFT, for example).
Once you have entered a command to run a particular background
application, the program goes to work for a period of time without
further direction and without notifying you of what it is doing.  In
the meantime, you may do other work on the system, checking back
later to see if the job is finished.  Such a program is said to be
"running in the background".


Foreground Application

A program which interfaces directly with the user (it may accept
user-input and generate screen output).


Establishing MOWSE:

MOWSE must first be established on the PC side, and then on the
Multics side.

On the PC side, issue the "mowse" command.  This sets up MOWSE into PC
resident memory and returns you to DOS command level.  You must the
start up a terminal emulator which uses MOWSE (WSTERM) in order to
login to Multics.  Issue the attach_mowse command on the Multics side.
At this point the environment is fully established.

Note that when MOWSE is first invoked on the PC side, you have the
option to preload application programs (as an argument to the
command). Preloading is discussed in the "Considerations" section
ahead.

At this point, you are still at the Multics command line.  You have
the option of staying on the Multics side and invoking MOWSE
applications, or of returning to the PC side, and invoking
applications from there. In order to continue from this point, you
must understand the functioning of the MOWSE terminal emulators.


The WSTerm emulator:

The WSTerm terminal emulator is the preferred terminal emulator for
use with MOWSE.  It allows cursor control and window functions, and
will support emacs.  This is the emulator that should be used when
moving from the PC to Multics.  It must be invoked from the MSDOS
command line by entering "wsterm".


Exiting from MOWSE:

To completely exit the MOWSE environment, you must first exit the
Multics MOWSE environment, and then the PC MOWSE terminal
environment.  To exit the MOWSE environment, you must:

      1. Quit MOWSE on Multics.  (detach_mowse (dtm) or logout)
      2. Quit MOWSE terminal environment on the PC.
         (exitmows)


Notes on detaching mowse:

     It is important to quit MOWSE as described.  If you just
     power-down, the Multics process remains active in MOWSE, and you
     must then physically disconnect it.

     Logging out of Multics automatically detaches MOWSE.  This is
     the preferred method if you are shutting everything down.  The
     detach_mowse command does NOT log you out of Multics.

     You can still use the MOWSE emulators with MOWSE detached on the
     Multics side.  You CANNOT, however, use the MOWSE emulators
     (WSTerm) once MOWSE has been detached on the PC side.  If you
     have detached MOWSE on the Multics side and the PC side, and wish
     to continue working on Multics from the PC, you must invoke a
     suitable terminal emulator, such as Kermit.


     If you issue the exitmows command on the PC before the
     detach_mowse (dtm) command on Multics, you will receive an error
     message.  Move to Multics and detach MOWSE as directed.

     The detach_mowse command on Multics should also unload the
     various background applications which are running.  You may
     receive messages to this effect.


Considerations for using MOWSE:

Two types of foreground programs are incompatible with the MOWSE
environment:

1)  MOWSE is destroyed by any other program that reconfigures the
    communication  link between the  PC and Multics  (Kermit, for
    example).

2)  MOWSE  is  destroyed  by  a  program  that  tries  to use the
    interrupts that  MOWSE is using.  The PC  mowse command lists
    the user_interrupt that is the default, and the other options
    that may be specified.


Using Preloading:

You can request pre-loading of application programs by using the /L
argument with the "mowse" command on the PC.  See the section on PC
MOWSE Commands for details.

The use of the /L option allows you to load mowse and the desired
applications in one step.  Note also that the /L option can be used
in conjunction with the FILE option.  An example illustrates the use
of these arguments to make the loading process most efficient:

1) Create a file (with default name MOWSE.INI) containing the
argument information you wish to use with the mowse command.  Such as

          /L BFT_LOAD /L CAPABIL /C 2 /P O
where BFT_LOAD and CAPABIL are applications to be loaded, C is the
communications port in use, and P is parity.


2) This file is then used in the mowse command (when it is first
issued on the PC) as follows:

          mowse /F

/F calls the file with the default name MOWSE.INI which, in this
case, contains instructions for loading the application programs BFT
(using BFT_LOAD) and CAPABIL, sets the communication port to 2, and
the parity to odd.


Background Messages:

Background applications are invisible to the user once they are
initiated, but they can produce messages.  It is a good practice to
periodically check these messages, in case some user-input becomes
necessary.

If you are working on the Multics side (i.e.  using one of the
emulators), background messages are displayed automatically.  If some
response is called for, enter the command <CTRL> ] R, and you will be
prompted for the response.

If you are running a PC program in the foreground, you must exit your
foreground program and invoke the "WSTerm" terminal emulator in order
to read background messages.
	Enter:  wsterm

You will be returned to Multics at whatever point you were when you
last left Multics.  WSTerm has a facility to display background
messages.


Error messages you may receive:

   "Bad command or filename"

When you receive this message in  reponse to a request to load an
application, it means that the application cannot be found.  This
can occur if you are not in directory containing the application,
and there is no path  to the correct directory.  Either establish
a path, or move to the appropriate directory.

   "Autoload:  XXXXX attempted"

You have requested that the application XXXXX be loaded.  The message
acknowledges the attempt to do so, but this does NOT necessarily mean
that the load has been successful.  You must try to use the
application to see if it has been loaded successfully.
