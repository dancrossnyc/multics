12/14/80  dot_fig_index.compin

Syntax:  .ifi dot_fig_index "figure-title"


Function:
This compose macro adds a 'figure-title' to the list of Illustrations
in the Table of Contents, if creation of such a list has been enabled
(see fig_on.compin.info), without putting a centered Figure caption on
the output page.


Arguments:
'figure-title' is the title of the figure, as it is to appear in the
   list of Illustrations (first caps, no underlines).


Notes:
1) The dot_fig_index macro is used to generate a list of Illustrations
   entry when, for any reason, the dot_fig macro cannot be used to
   create the figure caption.
2) This macro advances the figure "dot number" counter so care must be
   taken in referencing the figure in the text.  The next use of the
   fig, fig_index, or fig_get_no macro resets the figure "dot number"
   counter back to zero.
3) See dot_fig.compin.info, fig.compin.info,
   dot_fig_get_no.compin.info, fig_get_no.compin.info, and
   fig_on.compin.info for related information.
