03/21/90  terminate_refname, tmr

Syntax as a command:  tmr ref_names


Function: removes a segment or MSF from your address space and resets
links to the terminated file. It is commonly used prior to initiating
a different version of a program.


Arguments:
ref_names
   are the reference names of segments or MSFs to be terminated.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses all error messages.

-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies a reference name STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument.


Notes: This command allows termination by reference name rather than
by pathname.  The segment or MSF itself is terminated, not merely the
reference name specified.

Be careful not to unintentionally terminate a segment of the command
language interpreter or another critical piece of the environment.
Fatal process errors usually result from such an action.

The star convention is not recognized.

If the refname specified is on a component of an object MSF, all of the
components of the MSF are terminated, and links to them unsnapped.
