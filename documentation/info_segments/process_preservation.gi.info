02/06/81: The process preservation facility allows an interactive
process to be preserved if it becomes disconnected from its login
terminal due to a phone hangup or an FNP crash.  The process is
preserved until the site's maximum inactive time has elapsed.  During
this time, the user can call back, log in, and request reconnection
to the disconnected process.  Other options include destruction of
the disconnected process (with or without creation of a new process),
or creation of an additional process (for users with permission to
have multiple interactive processes).


Saving processes: The project and the user must both be given the
disconnect_ok attribute by the system and project administrator in
order to have disconnected processes saved.  The login control
argument, -save_on_disconnect (-save) requests the saving of the
process created by this login if it becomes disconnected.  The
project administrator can give a user the save_on_disconnect (save)
attribute, which specifies a default of -save, eliminating the need
to type the argument at each login.  The -no_save_on_disconnect
(-nosave) login argument can be used to override this default.  The
system administrator can enable the facility for all users on a
project without modifying and installing the PDT, by giving the
project both the disconnect_ok and save_on_disconnect attributes in
the SAT.  Note that this removes control of this facility from the
project administrator.


Connecting to a saved process: is controlled by a number of new login
control arguments: -create, -connect, -new_proc, -destroy, -list.  If
a user who has a disconnected process logs in without specifying the
disposition of the process by giving one of those arguments, the user
is placed in the connect request loop, in which requests analogous to
the new control arguments are accepted (create, connect, etc.) Type
"help" in the connect request loop for more information.  This
information can also be seen while logged in, by typing "help
connect_help", but note that the wording of this information assumes
that the user is presently in the connect request loop.  The
reconnection process does deal correctly with the case where a user
has multiple interactive processes, some of which are disconnected.


The state of your process after you connect to it will be as if you
had just hit the QUIT button: you may have lost some output and some
typed ahead input, and you are at a command level one higher than you
were before.  (This is true unless you were in a subsystem that has
its own QUIT handler, in which case the state of your process depends
on how your subsystem responds to QUIT.) In the normal case, the
message "Wait for QUIT" is printed on your terminal, followed, after
some seconds, by "QUIT", and any other output that the process might
produce, such as a ready message, messages sent by other users during
the time of disconnection, etc.  The start, release, or
program_interrupt commands can be used, as appropriate, to abort or
resume execution of the program that was running at the time of
disconnection.  The user is not restricted to those three commands -
anything valid after a QUIT is valid after reconnection.


Restrictions: Only a process using the tty_ dim to control its login
terminal can be connected to.  This excludes the ARPANET dim and any
private dims.  This restriction will be removed as time permits.

Users with their own direct process overseers, and users running
subsystems that do their own IPS masking and signal handling might
encounter difficulties in saving, or reconnecting to, disconnected
processes.


Dealing with restrictions: To avoid having a saved process that
cannot be connected to, either request a default of -nosave, or login
-nosave when any of the above circumstances prevail (e.g., logging in
over the ARPANET), or type the no_save_on_disconnect command in the
process.  This command takes no arguments, and produces no output; it
causes the process to log itself out when it receives a sus_ signal.
This can be reversed by the save_on_disconnect command, which is only
effective if -save was in effect at login time, either by default or
by use of the argument.  If you have a disconnected process that will
not respond to your connect attempt, use the new_proc or destroy
requests to dispose of it.
