03/04/85  dump_segment_


This subroutine prints the dump of a segment formatted in the same way
as the dump_segment command would print it.  The output format is
controlled by a bit string that allows most of the formatting control
arguments available to dump_segment.

:Entry:  dump_segment_:  03/04/85  dump_segment_


Function:
prints the dump of a segment formatted in the same way as the
dump_segment command would print it.



Syntax:
declare dump_segment_ entry (ptr, ptr, fixed bin, fixed bin(18),
     fixed bin(18), bit(*));
call dump_segment_ (iocb_ptr, first, block_size, offset, count,
     format);


Arguments:
iocb_ptr
   is a pointer to the I/O control block that specifies where the dump
   is to be written.  (Input)
first
   is a pointer to the first word of the data to be dumped.  (Input)
block_size
   is the number of words in the block if blocked output is desired.
   If unblocked output is desired, this is zero.  (Input)
offset
   is an arbitrary offset to be printed in addition to the address of
   the first word of data to be dumped if the offset option in the
   format string is specified.  (It is reset to this initial value at
   the start of each block.)  (Input)


count
   is the number of words to dump, starting with the word pointed to by
   first.  (Input)
format
   is a format control bit string with the following definition:  (See
   the dump_segment command in the Multics Commands and Active
   Functions Manual, for a full discussion of these arguments.) (Input)


:Entry:  string:  03/04/85 dump_segment_$string


Function:  This entry point returns the formatted dump of a segment.
The ouput format is controlled by a bit string that allows most of the
formatting control arguments available to the dump_segment command.


Syntax:
dcl dump_segment_$string entry (ptr, fixed bin (21), ptr, fixed bin,
     fixed bin (18), fixed bin (18), bit (*));
call dump_segment_$string (string_ptr, string_length, first,
     block_size, offset, count, format)


Arguments:
string_ptr
   is the pointer to the varying character string to place the output
   in.  (Input)
string_length
   is the maximum length of the varying character string.  (Input)
first
   is the pointer to the first word of data to be dump.  (Input)
block_size
   is the output dump in blocks of this number of words.  (Input)
offset
   is an arbitrary offset to be printed in addition to the address of
   the first word of data to be dumped if the offset option in the
   format string is specified.  (It is reset to this initial value at
   the start of each block.)  (Input)


count
   is the number of words to be dump.  (Input)
format
   is the bit string controlling the output modes.  (Input) Described
   in dump_segment_format.incl.pl1.

dump_segment_format.incl.pl1.
