02/15/85  list_ref_names, lrn

Syntax as a command:  lrn paths {-control_args}


Function: lists the reference names associated with a given segment.
You can specify segments by either pathname or segment number.


Arguments:
paths
   are the segment numbers and pathnames of segments known in your
   process.  They can be "-name STR" ("-nm STR") to specify a pathname
   that begins with a minus sign or looks like a segment number.  If
   you supply no paths, information for all segments known in your
   process is printed, excluding those known in ring 0.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints information for all known segments, including ring 0
   segments.  It is equivalent to -from 0.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of the reference names for the entire execution
   of the command.


-from N, -fm N
   allows you to specify a range of segment numbers.  You can use it
   with -to; information for the segment numbers in this range is
   printed.  If you don't select -to, the highest used segment number
   is assumed.
-to
   allows you to specify a range of segment numbers.  If you supply no
   -from, the segment number of the first segment not in ring 0 is
   assumed.


Notes: You can mixed all the above arguments (segment specifiers and
control arguments).  For example, in the command line
   lrn  156 -from 230 path_one
information is printed for segment 156, all segments from 230 on, and
the segment whose pathname is path_one.  In the default condition, when
called with no arguments, list_ref_names prints information on all
segments that are not in ring 0.
