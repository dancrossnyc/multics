Known errors in the current release of depd.

Description

5  phx18738
The following two commands produce different results.  They shouldn't.

   depd error_table_$noentry
   depd >sl1>error_table_$noentry

The error occurs because the absolute pathname form isn't recognized as
a potential error table entry.

4  phx11853
depd should requote the value returned which it is invoked as an active
function.

3  phx09340
get_entry_point_dcl uses invalid code:
  if substr(Aep_name, 1, length("XXX")) = "XXX" then...

This is invalid when Aep_name is shorter than "XXX".

2  phx09270
get_entry_point_dcl_ fails to rtrim whitespace from the name of the
entrypoint argument.

1  phx13822
For procedures which use structures as arguments, certain structure
declarations are inexactly returned as parameter declarations by depd
because the mechanism for encoding argument descriptors does not
provide an adequate description of the alignment of a structure.  The
descriptor only says whether the overall structure is packed or not,
and does not specify whether or not it was originally declared with the
aligned attribute.

Unfortunately, PL/I complains of an argument attribute mismatch if the
structures do not have exactly the same attributes.  See the notes
below for more details.  Also, refer to the TR for a test case which
demonstrates the problem.
