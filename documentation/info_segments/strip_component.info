03/31/83  strip_component, spc

Syntax:  spc path {STR}


Syntax as active function:  [spc path {STR}]


Function:  returns the archive component name portion of the absolute
pathname of the specified entry with the last component removed.  If an
archive component pathname is not supplied, then this is equivalent to
strip_entry.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname from which the trailing name component is removed.
STR
   is the character string to be stripped.  If STR is not specified,
   the last component of the entryname portion of path is removed.  If
   STR is specified, the last components are removed only if they match
   STR and STR does not equal path.


Notes:  Since the pathname is returned in quotes, the command processor
treats it as a single argument regardless of special characters in the
name.
