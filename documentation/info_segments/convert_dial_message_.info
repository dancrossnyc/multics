02/08/84  convert_dial_message_

The convert_dial_message_ subroutine is used in conjunction with the
dial_manager_ subroutine to control dialed terminals.  It converts an
event message received from the answering service over a dial control
event channel into status information more easily used by the user.

:Entry:  return_io_module:
02/08/84 convert_dial_message_$return_io_module


Function: processes event messages from the answering service
regarding the status of a dialed terminal or an auto call line.  In
addition to returning line status, this entry point also returns the
device name and I/O module name for use in attaching the line through
the iox_ subroutine.


Syntax:
declare convert_dial_message_$return_io_module entry (fixed bin(71),
     char(*), char(*), fixed bin, 1 aligned, 2 bit(1) unal, 2 bit(1)
     unal, 2 bit(1) unal, 2 bit(33) unal, fixed bin(35));
call convert_dial_message_$return_io_module (message, channel_name,
     io_module, n_dialed, flags, code);


Arguments:
message
   is the event message to be decoded.  (Input)
channel_name
   is the name of the channel that has dialed up or hung up.  (Output)
io_module
   is the name of the iox_ I/O module to be used with the assigned
   device.  (Output)
n_dialed
   is the number of terminals currently dialed to the process or -1.
   (Output)


flags
   is a bit string of the following structure:  (Output)
      dcl 1 flags        aligned,
            2 dialed_up  bit(1) unal,
            2 hung_up    bit(1) unal,
            2 control    bit(1) unal,
            2 pad        bit(33) unal;
   Only the first three bits have meaning, and only one can be on at a
   time.  See "Notes" below.
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  The message may be either a control message or an informative
message.  Informative messages have flags.control off ("0"b), n_dialed
is set to -1, channel is set to the name of the channel involved,
io_module is set to the name of an I/O module, and either
flags.dialed_up or flags.hung_up is on, indicating that the named
channel has either just dialed up or just hung up.

Control messages have flags.control on ("1"b), and n_dialed is set to
the number of dialed terminals or -1.
