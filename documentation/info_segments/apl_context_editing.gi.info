06/16/81  APL context editing

The MR9.0 release of APL offers some new requests which provide a
context editing capability.  These requests allow searching for a
specified string in a function, substitution of one string for
another, and selection of all lines in a function containing a
specified string.


Notes on Syntax:
The context editing commands are provided as an extension to the
regular APL editor.  Request lines beginning with a dot are
interpreted as context editing commands.  A slash is used as the
string delimiter.  The slash character may not appear inside a
search or substitution string.  No other editor requests may
follow a context request on the same line.


Context searching:

./string/

Searches for the first line in the function containing "string".
The search begins at the current line and proceeds to the end of
the function, then continues from the top of the function to the
original line.  The line which contains "string" is displayed.
If an empty search string is specified (//), the previous search
string is used.  The slash character may not appear in the search
string.


Reverse searching:

.</string/

Searches backwards (toward the beginning of the function) for
"string".  The search begins on the current line of the function
and proceeds to the beginning of the function, then continues
from the bottom of the function to the original line.  The line
which contains "string" is displayed.  If an empty search string
is specified (//), the previous search string is used.  The slash
character may not appear in the search string.


Substitution:

.s/string1/string2/

Substitutes "string2" for the first occurance of "string1" in the
current line.  The line is displayed after the substitution is
made.  If string1 is empty, the previous search string or
substitute string1 is used.  If string2 is empty, string1 is
deleted from the line.  The slash character may not appear in
either substitute string.

.s/string1/string2/p

If a "p" is typed at the end of a substitute request, the line is
displayed after the change has been made.


.s/string1/string2/?

If a "?" is typed at the end of a substitute request, the line is
displayed with the substitution made, and the user is asked if
the substitution is correct.  The change is actually made only if the
user answers "yes".


Global line selection:

.g/string/

Finds  and  display all lines in the function containing "string".
The slash character may not appear in the string.  The current
line is not changed.
