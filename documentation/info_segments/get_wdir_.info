:Entry: get_wdir_: 06/12/81  get_wdir_

Function: The get_wdir_ function returns the absolute pathname of the
user's current working directory.  For a discussion of working
directories, see "System Directories" in Section III of the MPM
Reference Guide.


Syntax:
declare get_wdir_ entry returns (character (168));
declare working_dir character (168);
working_dir = get_wdir_ ();


Arguments:
working_dir
   contains the absolute pathname of the user's current working
   directory.  (Output)


Notes: Working directories are per-ring.  If get_wdir_ is invoked in a
ring for which a working directory has never been set, it will use the
sub_err_ mechanism to signal an error.  See the MPM Subsystem Writer's
Guide for more information on sub_err_, and the MPM Reference guide
for more information on ring protection.  The sub_err_ action code
given is "h".
