:Entry: execute_epilogue_: 02/08/84  execute_epilogue_

Function: is called during process or run unit termination to call the
routines in the list of epilogue handlers.  The logout and new_proc
commands are the prime callers of execute_epilogue_.  It is also
called when the run unit terminates to allow programs executing in the
run unit to clean up.  The add_epilogue_handler_ subroutine is used to
add a program to the list that execute_epilogue_ calls.


Syntax:
declare execute_epilogue_ entry (bit (1) aligned);
call execute_epilogue_ (run_only);


Arguments:
run_only
   is set to "1"b if epilogue handlers are to be invoked only for the
   run unit and not for the entire process.  (Input)
