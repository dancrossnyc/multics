Syntax:  heals_report {report_names} {-control_args}


Function: produces reports of interest to site-support and
field-engineering personnel.  The reports are appended to a report
file specified in -output_file or by default to the heals_reports
segment in the working directory.  The ASCII report segment can be
displayed, perused by you on the terminal, or printed on a high-speed
line printer.


Arguments:
report_names
   can be one or more names from the following list (see -all below):
   io_error
      selects the I/O error report.
   sorted_io_error
      selects the sorted I/O error report.
   media_io_error
      is similar to the sorted io error report except that the primary
      sort key is the media volume name (e.g., tape reel number).
   cpu_error
      selects the CPU error report.
   mos_edac_error
      selects the MOS EDAC error report.


Control arguments:
-output_file path, -of path
   puts the report file in the file specified by path.
-from DT, -fm DT
   specifies the date and time after which errors are reported.  If
   this argument is not given, the default value is the value of -to
   time minus 24 hours.
-to DT
   specifies the date and time up to which errors are reported.  If
   this argument is not given, the default value is the current date
   and time.
-all, -a
   specifies that all reports are to be generated.  This argument can
   be used instead of listing all report names.


Notes: The dates specified after -fm, -from, and -to must be
acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_ (see the Subroutines manual).


Access required: You must have r access on
>system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log.
