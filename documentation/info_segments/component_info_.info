Entry points in component_info_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  name:  02/06/84 component_info_$name


Function:  This entry point specifies the component by name.


Syntax:
declare component_info_$name entry (ptr, char(32) aligned, ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call component_info_$name (seg_ptr, comp_name, arg_ptr, code);


Arguments:
seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the bound segment.
comp_name
   is the name of the component.
arg_ptr
   is a pointer to a structure to be filled in (a declaration of which
   is found in component_info.incl.pl1).  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  offset:  02/06/84 component_info_$offset


Function:  This entry point specifies the component by its offset.


Syntax:
declare component_info_$offset entry (ptr, fixed bin(18), ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call component_info_$offset (seg_ptr, offset, arg_ptr, code);


Arguments:
seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the bound segment.  (Input)
offset
   is an offset into the bound segment corresponding to the text,
   internal static or symbol section of some component.  (Input)
arg_ptr
   is a pointer to a structure to be filled in (a declaration of which
   is found in component_info.incl.pl1).  (Input)
