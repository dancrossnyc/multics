03/12/90  set_mailing_address, smla

Syntax as a command:  smla {address} {-control_args}


Function:  sets the user's preferred mailing address, which is used by
the mail system when mail is addressed to him by Person_id or alias
alone (i.e., "sdm Opus", instead of "sdm Opus.Bloom").  The user can
also indicate that his mailing address be reset to the default
(Person_id.default_Project_id).  For example, mail addressed to "Milo"
is sent to Milo.DProject, where "DProject" is Milo's default project at
the time the mail is sent.  Maintainers of other mail table entries can
also use this command to update those entries.


Arguments:
address
   can be any recipient address accepted by send_mail.  You can specify
   only one address.  It is incompatible with -dp.


Control arguments:
-default_project, -dp
   resets the mailing address using the default project.
-entry name
   specifies the entry whose mailing address is to be updated.  Enclose
   the name in quotes if it contains white space.  If name is an alias,
   its associated regular entry is updated.  You can use -entry only if
   you have rw access to the ACS segment associated with the entry.
   (Default:  your own entry)
-user address
   specifies the recipient address.  The address can be any address
   accepted by send_mail.  You can specify only one address.  Use
   -user in place of the address field if the address can be
   interpreted as a control argument.  It is incompatible with the
   -dp argument.


Notes:  Don't use -dp if the entry is not associated with a registered
user, since only users have default projects.  If you attempt this, an
error is reported.
