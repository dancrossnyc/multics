Function:

Background File Transfer (BFT) is a MOWSE (Multics Online Work Station
Environment) application that transfers files between Multics and the
IBM PC.  This file transfer uses cooperating processes running in the
background on each computer, which allow you to run other applications
while the transfer is taking place.


BFT is implemented on both computers such that transfer operations can
be initiated from either machine.  BFT maintains the transfer queue in
the Multics segment >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.bft.  All
transfer requests will be routed through this queue.  Two file
transfers can occur simultaneously, one file being transferred from
Multics to the PC, and one from the PC to Multics.


We refer to the machine you are working on (in terms of operating
system) as the "local" machine, and the other as the "remote" machine.
In other words, if you using one of the terminal emulators to work on
Multics, then Multics is the local machine, and the PC is the remote
machine.  If you are at MSDOS command line, then the PC is the local
machine, and Multics is the remote machine.

BFT can be invoked from command line, or called from within other
MOWSE application programs using the BFT PC and Multics entrypoints.


Loading BFT:

BFT must be loaded before it can be used.  To do this, enter the
command "bft load" from Multics, or "bft_load" from the PC.  This will
install BFT into the user's process by registering BFT with MOWSE in
addition to loading the PC portion of BFT into PC resident memory.


Using BFT:

In order to use BFT, the user may issues requests through the "bft"
command facility; or applications may make requests through the bft_
entrypoints.  For a description of the BFT commands, refer to the
info_seg bft.info; for a description of the entrypoints, refer to
bft_.info and pc_bft_.info.


Unloading BFT:

The user may remove BFT from his process, and from PC resident memory.
This is accomplished by issuing the "bft unload" command on either
Multics or the PC.

BFT is also terminated when the user terminate MOWSE, either by
issuing the "detach_mowse" command or destroying his Multics process.


Recovering BFT:

If BFT is terminated while a file transfer is in progess, then the
process should be resumed with the "bft recover" command after BFT has
been loaded.  This will continue current transfers (in either
direction) from where they left off and to recover the queue of
pending requests.


Considerations (Background Messages):

User notification of BFT events (errors, transfer completions, etc.)
is performed through the MOWSE background_message facility.  Thus, it
is important to the user to view these messages (through WSTERM)
periodically to be sure of the operation and status of his transfer
requests.


Considerations (Error Messages):

Error messages are returned to you immediately if possible.  These
errors refer to problems on the local system, such as "BFT already
loaded", "file not found", "queue full", etc.  Errors on the remote
system are not immediately apparent; these are reported via the MOWSE
background message facility.  These errors will be of the "file not
found", and "incorrect access on entry" variety.


Considerations (Removing Floppy Disks):

While BFT is in the process of transferring files to or from a floppy
disk on the PC, do NOT remove the disk from the drive.  Doing so can
result in an incorrect transfer or the destruction of files.  Check
the messages in the background message queue to determine if a
transfer is complete before removing disks (see "Considerations
(Background Messages)" above).


Considerations (Multics Pathnames):

Multics pathnames contain the ">" and "<" characters.  This is an
incompatability with the PC command environment as the meaning of the
">" and "<" characters indicates I/O redirection.  Therefore it is
necessary to surround Multics pathnames when entered on the PC, with
double quotes (") so that the ">" and "<" characters are not
interpretted.  For example:

     bft store test.pl1 ">udd>m>joe>test.pl1"

Failure to do so will result in a DOS error message

     "File allocation error."


The Queue:

BFT maintains its queue information in the segment
>udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.bft.  It should NOT be deleted.
