03/07/80 Attributes for GCOS TSS files

The GCOS TSS Environment Simulator requires that pre-existing files have
their attributes set and available for use. Thus, files
created by gcos_card_utility, gcos_fms, or the GCOS Batch Environment
Simulator must have their attributes added before they can be used.

An exec_com is provided for this purpose; the user invokes the exec_com
with the pathname of the file to be processed. The exec_com then queries the
user interactively for the required information.

To use the exec_com, type "ec >unb>gtss_file_attributes path" or
"ec >unb>attr path", where path is the pathname of the file to have
its attributes added or altered.
