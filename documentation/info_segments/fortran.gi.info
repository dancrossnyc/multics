11/15/79  New FORTRAN

The new_fortran command provides Multics FORTRAN users with a new
compiler.  The new compiler is about five times faster than the old
compiler.  It handles source segments that are in a more standard form
than the old one and is closer to the ANSI standard than the old one.
With this installation, the new compiler becomes the standard Multics
FORTRAN compiler and is available as fortran, ft, and new_fortran.  The
old compiler is available as old_fortran.  At this point, old_fortran is
considered obsolete although it will not be deleted from the system.
There are currently no bug fixes or enhancements planned for the old
compiler.


Documentation:
An addendum to the Multics FORTRAN manual is being prepared and will be
available shortly.  In the interim, online info segments will be
provided to assist users in using the new_fortran compiler.  Users who
find the info segments incomplete or inaccurate should report such
findings as trouble reports.  The info segments provided are:

  new_fortran.info
  new_fortran_conversions.gi.info
  new_fortran_differences.gi.info
  new_fortran_extensions.gi.info
  new_fortran_bugs.info


new_fortran_differences.gi.info:
A list of differences and incompatibilities between the old FORTRAN
compiler and the new one.  Some will prevent old FORTRAN object segments
from executing in harmony with new FORTRAN object segments.  Others are
differences in semantic interpretation.  These incompatibilities arise
mainly from the old FORTRAN compiler's divergence from ANSI in favor of
Multics PL/I.


new_fortran_extensions.gi.info:
A list of extensions relative to the old FORTRAN compiler, as well as
list of those extensions planned for the future.


new_fortran_conversions.gi.info:
A list of syntactic differences between the input formats of the two
compilers.  Both compilers support an identical card-image format,
however, the free-form format accepted by each compiler is very
different.


new_fortran_bugs.info
A list of bugs, planned language features, and suggested improvements
for the new FORTRAN compiler.
