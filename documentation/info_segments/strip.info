Syntax:  strip path {STR}


Syntax as active function:  [strip path {STR}]


Function:  returns the absolute pathname of the specified entry, with
the last component removed if the entryname portion has more than one
component.  If an archive component pathname is specified, the
components are stripped off the archive component name if it has more
than one component.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname from which the trailing name component is removed.
STR
   is the character string to be stripped.  If STR is not specified,
   the last component is removed.  If STR is specified, the last
   components are removed only if they match STR and STR does not equal
   path.


Notes:  Since the pathname is returned in quotes, the command processor
treats it as a single argument regardless of special characters in the
name.
