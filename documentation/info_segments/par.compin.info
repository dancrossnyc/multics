Function:
This macro provides a standard paragraph break as appropriate for the
output device and optionally sets the indention for the paragraph to
the Nth level (See Notes.)

Macro action:
Sets paragraph separation space as defined for the device.
If N is given, sets paragraph indention to the Nth level; otherwise,
the current indention level is not changed.


Sets the first text to next (N+1) indention level.

Notes:
Ten levels of indention are defined in mutiples of a standard amount
for the output device, 4 spaces for typerwriters and 2 EMs for
phototypesetters.  Thus, level 0 is flush left for all devices while
level 2 is indented 8 spaces for typewriters and 4 EMs for
phototypesetters.
