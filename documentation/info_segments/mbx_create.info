08/15/83  mbx_create, mbcr

Syntax:  mbcr paths


Function:  creates a mailbox with a specified name in a designated
directory.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of mailboxes to be created; mbx suffix need not be
   given.


Access required:  Modify and append permission is required on the
parent directory.


Notes:  Name duplication is handled as follows--if the old segment
with that name has other names, the conflicting name is removed and the
user is notified; otherwise, the user is asked whether to delete the
old segment.

The extended access placed on a new mailbox is--

      adrosw  Person.*.*
      aow     *.SysDaemon.*
      aow     *.*.*

For more information on extended access, see mail and mbx_set_acl.
