Page 3-55;   change   the   description    of   "path"   in   the
enter_abs_request command to the following:

     path
        specifies  the pathname  of the  absentee control segment
        associated  with  this  request.   The  absin  suffix  is
        assumed.  If a pathname is given, it identifies the absin
        segment.   If  only  an  entryname  is  given,  the absin
        segment is located using the exec_com search list.

     Add the following  control arguments to enter_abs_request
     command:

     -authorization STR, -auth STR
        sets the  authorization of the process  to that specified
        by STR.  STR is a  character string composed of level and
        category names  for the desired  authorization, separated
        by commas.  STR cannot contain  any embedded blank or tab
        characters.  (The short names for each level and category
        always  contain  no  blanks  or  tabs,  and  can  be used
        whenever the  corresponding long names contain  blanks or
        tabs.)   STR  must  represent  an  authorization  that is
        within the range of  minimum and maximum authorization of
        Person_id  on  the   Project_id.   If  -authorization  is
        omitted, your current login  authorization is used.  (See
        the  Programmer's Reference  Manual for  more information
        about  process  authorizations.)   Allowed  authorization
        range can be displayed via the "user auth_range" command.
     -home_dir path, -hd path
        sets the  home directory of  the absentee process  to the
        path specified, if the  project administrator allows such
        changes.  The "user  attributes" command displays allowed
        attributes.   The vhomedir  attribute is  required to use
        the -home_dir  control argument.  The specified  home dir
        cannot exceed  64 characters and must be  specified as an
        absolute pathname.
     -no_start_up, -ns
        instructs  the standard  process overseer  not to execute
        the start_up.ec  segment in the absentee  process, if the
        project administrator  allows it.  The  "user attributes"
        command  displays  allowed   attributes.   The  nostartup
        attribute is required to use this control argument.
     -process_overseer path, -po path
        sets the process overseer for the absentee process to the
        procedure  given  by  path  if  the project administrator
        allows this.   If path ends in  the characters ",direct",
        the specified procedure is called directly during process
        initialization    rather    than    by    the    standard
        system-provided procedure.   This means that  the program
        used by path must perform  the tasks that would have been
        performed by  the standard procedure.  The  length of the
        process_overseer  path should  not exceed  64 characters.
        The   "user   attributes"    command   displays   allowed
        attributes.  The  vinitproc attribute is required  to use
        this control argument.
     -ring N, -rg N
        sets the initial ring to N  if this ring number is within
        the  range of  the  registered  minimum ring  and maximum
        ring.   This  range  may   be  displayed  via  the  "user
        ring_range" command.
     -start_up
        instructs  the standard  process overseer  to execute the
        start_up.ec segment if it exists.  Default.

Page 3-57;  add  the  following  to  the  Notes  section  of  the
enter_abs_request command.

     When -proxy is given, no attempt  is made by ear to validate
     attribute  dependent control  arguments.  Since  the job  is
     submitted on behalf of another  user, the attributes for the
     proxy user  will be validated only by  the answering service
     when  it  attempts  to  run  the  job.   Attribute dependent
     control arguments are:
            -no_start_up
            -home_dir
            -authorization
            -process_overseer
            -ring

Page 3-139; change program_interrupt to:

     Name:  program_interrupt, pi

     Syntax as a command:  pi {-control_arg}


     Function:   informs a  suspended invocation  of a  subsystem
     that the user wishes to abort the current request.


     Control arguments:
     -no_restore, -ns
        does  not  restore  the  standard  I/O  attachments  (see
        "Notes").


     Notes:    The  program   interrupt  command   is  used  with
     interactive subsystems.  Interactive subsystems are commands
     that  accept user  requests from  the terminal.   To abort a
     subsystem request the  user uses the quit (or  break) key to
     interrupt  execution, and  then gives  the program_interrupt
     command.   If   the  subsystem  supports  the   use  of  the
     program_interrupt  command, it   will abort  the interrupted


     request and  ask the user for  a new one.  If  the subsystem
     does not  support the use of  program_interrupt, the command
     will  print an  error message.    The user  may then  either
     restart the interrupted operation  with the "start" command,
     or abort the entire  subsystem invocation with the "release"
     command.

     This  command restores  the attachments  of the  user_input,
     user_output,  and  error_output  switches  and  the  mode of
     user_i/o to their values at  the time of interruption unless
     you give -no_restore.

     If there is  more than one suspended command  in your stack,
     the  stack   is  searched  for  a   program  that  supposrts
     program_interrupt   and   any   interventing   programs  are
     released.
