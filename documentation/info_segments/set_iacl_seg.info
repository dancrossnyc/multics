01/14/87  set_iacl_seg, sis

Syntax as a command:  sis path mode1 {User_id1...modeN User_idN}
   {-control_args}


Function:  manipulates the segment initial access control lists
(initial ACLs) of directories.


Arguments:
path
   specifies the directory whose segment initial ACL is to be changed.
   If it is -working_directory (-wd), the segment initial ACL for the
   user's working directory is changed.  You can use the star
   convention.
modes
   is the mode associated with User_ids.  It can consist of any or all
   the letters rew.  The strings null, n, and "" specifically deny
   access to User_ids.
User_ids
   is an access control name of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  If
   one or more of the components is missing, all entries that match
   User_ids are changed to modes (see set_acl for a description of the
   matching strategy).  If the three components are present, the
   segment initial ACL entry with that name is changed to modes or one
   is added if none exists.


Control arguments:
-no_sysdaemon, -nsd
   does not add "rw *.SysDaemon.*" when using -replace.
-replace, -rp
   deletes all segment initial ACL terms--with the exception of the
   default *.SysDaemon.* term unless you supplied -no_sysdaemon--before
   adding the terms specified on the command line.  (Default:  to add
   to, and modify, the existing initial ACL)
-ring N, -rg N
   identifies the ring number whose segment initial ACL should be set.
   It can appear anywhere on the line, except between a mode and its
   associated User_id, and affects the whole line.  If present, follow
   it by N (where 0 <= N <= 7).  If omitted, your ring is assumed.
-sysdaemon, -sd
   adds, with -replace, an "rw *.SysDaemon.*" initial ACL term before
   adding the terms specified on the command line.  (Default)


Notes:  A segment initial ACL contains the ACL entries to be placed on
segments created in the specified directory (see "Access Control" in
the Programmer's Reference Manual).
