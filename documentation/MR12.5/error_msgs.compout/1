               these drives  and the problems.  All  other drives

               main memory or on the  paging device.  The RPV has
               not been shut down either, so that the system will
               perform some salvaging when it comes up.

     Action:   Attempt to ready those  drives that are not ready.
               When this has been done, retry ESD.  If the drives

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     System shutdown

     Meaning:  During  an attempt  to shut  down the  system, the
               system  could not run  on the bootload  CPU.  This
               problem  may  be  due   to  hardware  or  software
               problems.  The system will attempt to crash, which
               it may not complete.

     Action:   If  the system  does not  complete its  attempt to
               crash, it  should be crashed manually.   It may be
               necessary  to change   the bootload  CPU manually.
               This  can be  done by  putting all  CPUs into STEP
               mode, manually assigning an  interrupt mask to the
               new bootload CPU from the bootload SCU maintenance
               panel,  taking only  the new  bootload CPU  out of
               STEP mode,  and doing an EXECUTE  SWITCHES on that
               CPU.  Once the system has crashed successfully, an

     Meaning:  During  the attempt  to shut  down the  system, an

     Meaning:  Both halves of the ring zero syserr log buffer are

     Stream:   BOS Typewriter (Crashes system)

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   A fault has
               occurred while copying data  from the wired syserr
               log buffer to the  paged syserr log.  This usually
               results  from a disk  error on the  LOG partition,
               which  would also   generate disk  error messages.
               The sequence numbers of  the affected messages are
               given because those messages may not appear in the
               LOG partition.

     Time:     While system is running.

     Meaning:  This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or
               CPU  or  memory  hardware  problems.   If too many
               errors  occur  updating  the  LOG  partition,  log

     Meaning:  Automatic   copying   of   syserr   messages  into

               in the copying process.  Another message will have
               been  printed prior  to this  one, describing  the
               problem.  An  Answering Service dump  usually will
               have been created, as well.

     Action:   If the error is recoverable (temporary disk error,
               record  quota overflow,   etc.-- see  the previous
               message(s) to make  that decision), syserr copying
               can be restarted by  issuing the following command
               in admin mode (ur using send_admin_command):

                    syserr_log_man_$restart_copying

               If the problem persists,  delete the first segment
               (first in  the list produced by  the list command)
               in >sc1>syserr_log,  and restart copying.   If the

               >sc1>syserr_log and reboot;  the directory will be
               re-created automatically.

               The  display_log_segment command   can be  used to

     Time:     System Intialization.

     Meaning:  This indicates a logic error in the supervisor, or

               to  the free pool  on dskX_NN{S}, but  the address
               was already marked as free.  This indicates damage

     Meaning:  An  attempt to  withdraw a  disk address  from the

               finding  a volume  map word  with at  least one of
               bits 0, 33, 34, and 35 on.  These bits are invalid
               for volume map words.   This indicates hardware or
               software failure.

     Action:   Perform an  ESD.  Reboot the system  and perform a
               volume salvage (not a scavenge) of the disk volume
               dskX_NN{S}.  This may  be performed at Initializer

               detect volume map words with invalid bits enabled,
               so the salvager must be used.  Once the salvage is
               complete,  the volume  may  be  added back  to the

     Action:   It may  be possible to recover  the lost addresses
               by a volume salvage.  However, a hard device error
               will prevent  the volume salvage  from succeeding.
