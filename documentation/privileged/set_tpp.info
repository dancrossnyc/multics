02/27/85  set_tpp, stpp

Syntax as a command:  stpp directory {-control_args}


Function:  prints and modifies the time-page product (tpp) of a
specified directory.  It should be used if the charge_disk command
reports an inconsistency between the total tpp for a project, as
recorded in projfile, and the total tpp for that project, as computed
from the tpps of the project's directories.  (This should be done only
after it has been determined that the figure in projfile is the correct
one, and the tpp of some directory was damaged.)


Arguments:
directory
   is the pathname of the directory whose tpp is to be printed or
   modified.


Control arguments:
-directory, -dr
   print or modify the tpp for directory pages.
-long, -lg
   print the current tpp and its equivalent dollar charge, plus the
   quota, pages used, time tpp last updated, sons logical volume
   identifier, and quota switch.
-print, -pr
   print the current tpp and its equivalent dollar charge.
-segment, -sm
   print or modify the tpp for segment pages.  This is the default.
-set N
   modify the tpp as specified by N.  See "Notes" below for the
   possible formats of the N value, and more details on the functioning
   of the set operation.


Notes:  If none of the arguments:  -print, -long, or -set is given,
-print is assumed; more than one may be given.

The N value given with the -set control argument may be in units of
page-seconds or dollars and cents, a leading dollar sign ($) indicating
the latter.  Value may be an absolute value or a relative value (i.e.,
a change to be applied to the current tpp), a leading plus (+) or minus
(-) sign indicating the latter.  When both a dollar sign and a plus or
minus sign are given, they may appear in either order.  No blanks may
appear between the signs and the numeric value.


When an absolute value is given for N, the setting of that value is
only approximate.  The equivalent change from the current tpp is
computed, and then applied as a change; since the tpp of an active
directory is updated frequently by the storage system, the resulting
tpp, after this change is applied, is larger than the specified value
by the number of page-seconds that have accrued during the execution of
the command.  Use of the relative form of the value argument is
recommended over the absolute form.

When the -set control argument is specified, the size and direction of
the change and the (approximate) resulting new value are computed and
displayed, in both page-seconds and dollars, and the user is asked if
the change should actually be made.  If the answer is yes, the change
is made and then the actual resulting new value is printed.
