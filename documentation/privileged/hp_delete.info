02/08/85  hp_delete, hpdl

Syntax as a command:  hpdl path


Function:  deletes segments or directories (including their inferior
directories, segments, and links (if accessible)) which cannot be
deleted by the delete or delete_dir commands due to connection failures
or other problems resulting from volume deregistration or the failure
of emergency shutdown.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment or directory to be deleted.  The star
   convention may not be used.


Access required:  The hp_delete command requires access to the
highly-privileged hphcs_ gate.  Access to the system_privilege_ gate is
required as well.  All discretionary (ACL) and nondiscretionary (AIM)
access control is observed by this command.  The segment or directory
to be deleted may, however, have a lower ring bracket than the user's
current validation level.


Notes:  The deletion is not logged in the syserr log.

The user is queried once before performing the deletion.

Out-of-service directories may be deleted.

The segment safety switch is ignored.
