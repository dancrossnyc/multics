02/26/85 print_meters

Syntax as a command:  print_meters {path}


Function:  prepares a system performance report from a data segment
containing system metering data.  The metering data is accumulated by
as_meter_ in the stat_seg segment; usually this is copied into a
temporary segment by copy_as_meters before report preparation.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the data segment.


Notes:  The report contains long lines and is designed for dprinting
(use of the file_output command is recommended).  The report consists
of a paragraph for each bootload.  A header giving the system name,
bootload time, and time of last shutdown or crash, is followed by one
line per sample.  Samples are normally taken at each accounting update
(every 15 minutes) and at startup and shutdown time.  The lines contain
the following columns.

   Time           time of sample
   Units          load units
   CP             number of CPUs
   Kmem           number of 1024K word main memory pages
   MPD            number of million (M) word paging device (PD) blocks
   Meter time     time since bootload


   CPU time       CPU time available during sample interval
   Avg queue      average queue length (number of processes in queue)
   Response       average response time (seconds)
   Idle           total idle time in sample interval
   Zero idle      total zero idle time in sample interval
   Avg eligible   average number of eligible processes
   K mu           memory units charged in thousands
