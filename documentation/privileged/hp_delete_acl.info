02/08/85  hp_delete_acl, hpda

Syntax as a command:  hpda {path} {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function:  removes entries from the access control lists (ACLs) of
segments, multisegment files, directories, and gates.  This command
operates on objects whose ring brackets prevent them from being
operated on by the delete_acl command.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment, multisegment file, directory, or gate.
   If it is -wd, -working_dir, or omitted, the working directory is
   assumed.  If path is omitted, no User_id can be specified.  The star
   convention can be used.
User_ids
   are access control names that must be of the form
   Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL entries with matching names are
   deleted.  (For a description of the matching strategy, refer to the
   Multics Programmer's Reference Manual, Order No.  AG91.)  If no
   User_id is given, the user's Person_id and current Project_id are
   assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   causes the entire ACL to be deleted with the exception of an entry
   for *.SysDaemon.*.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "User name not on ACL."
-directory, -dr
   specifies that only directories are affected.  The default is
   segments, multisegment files, directories, and gates.
-segment, -sm
   specifies that only segments, multisegment files, and gates are
   affected.


Access required:  The user needs modify permission on the containing
directory.  The system administrator needs access to the highly
privileged gate hphcs_.


Notes:  If the hp_delete_acl command is invoked with no arguments, it
deletes the entry for the user's Person_id and current Project_id on
the ACL of the working directory.

An ACL entry for *.SysDaemon can be deleted by specifying either
*.SysDaemon.* or *.SysDaemon.  The user should be aware that in
deleting access to the SysDaemon project he prevents Backup.SysDaemon.*
from saving the segment or directory (including the hierarchy inferior
to the directory) on tape, Dumper.SysDaemon.* from reloading it, and
Retriever.SysDaemon.* from retrieving it.
