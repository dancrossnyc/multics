02/28/85 write_acct_bill

Syntax as a command:  write_acct_bill mm yy


Function:  produces a bill for each external account number.  Each bill
contains one line for each Multics account.


Arguments:
mm
   is a two-digit month designation.
yy
   are the last two digits of the year.


Notes:  The input to this program is the reqfile segment in the working
directory.

The output is on the switches named bill and mailing_copy, which must
have been previously attached.

This command is used by biller.ec to create the bill and mailing_copy
segments.  The two segments differ in that mailing_copy has a page
containing the mailing address of the intended recipient of the bill.

The operation of this command depends on the proper attachment of the
I/O switches (by biller.ec).
