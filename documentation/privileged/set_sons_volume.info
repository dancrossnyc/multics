02/27/85 set_sons_volume

Syntax as a command:  set_sons_volume path LVNAME


Function:  used to set the logical volume on which the segments of a
directory reside.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory whose sons logical volume ID is to
   be set.
LVNAME
   is the name of the logical volume.


Access required:  Use of this command requires access to hphcs_.


Notes:  This is a highly privileged command, which defeats the normal
quota management for logical volumes.  Normally, this command is only
used in system_start_up.ec to set the logical volume for the directory
>pdd.  This operation is only valid on an empty directory.  The usual
method of creating a directory with a specific "sons logical volume" (a
master directory) is to use the create_dir command (described in the
Multics Commands and Active Functions manual, Order No.  AG92.
