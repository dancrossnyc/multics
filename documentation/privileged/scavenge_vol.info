02/27/85 scavenge_vol

Syntax as a command:  scavenge_vol {pvname} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [scavenge_vol {pvname} {-control_args}]


Function:  invokes the Scavenger to scavenge one or more physical
volumes.  The Scavenger examines and validates VTOCEs, deletes
per-process and per-bootload VTOCEs from previous bootloads, recovers
lost VTOCEs, recovers lost records, and checks for reused addresses
(two VTOCES claiming the same record address).  See the Multics System
Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for a description of
scavenging.

If no control arguments are specified, no default actions are taken.

The initializer command "x scav" logs in a daemon to perform a scavenge
using the scavenge_vol command.


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the physical volume to be scavenged.  It must be part
   of a mounted logical volume.  This argument is required unless the
   -all or -lv control argument is specified.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   scavenges, in turn, all mounted physical volumes.
-auto
   controls scavenging of physical volumes when the -lv or -all control
   argument is specified.  When this option is used, those physical
   volumes with volume inconsistencies are scavenged.
-check
   validates the command control arguments and prints a list of
   physical volumes that would be scavenged as a result of the command
   line input, but does not actually perform the scavenge.
-debug
   should be used only by systems programmers debugging the Scavenger.
   It causes additional information to be printed on the bootload
   console during the scavenge.


-dump
   records the VTOCE image of any VTOCE found inconsistent into the
   syserr log.  The image recorded is the VTOCE prior to any correction
   by the Scavenger.
-lv lvname
   scavenges, in turn, all physical volumes belonging to the logical
   volume specified by lvname.  The logical volume must be mounted.
-no_optimize, -nopt
   disables optimization of Scavenger processing.  This causes the
   Scavenger to take longer, but reduces its effect on other users of
   the system.  With this option, VTOCE read-ahead is disabled, and the
   Scavenger periodically lowers its traffic control priority.


Access required:  Access to the hphcs_ gate is required.


Notes:  The scavenge of each volume is done entirely in ring 0.  Any
error messages are recorded into the syserr log.  It is possible to
interrupt a scavenge of a volume with the QUIT key, but it cannot be
restarted afterwards with the start or program_interrupt commands.

When the scavenge_vol command is invoked as an active function, it
returns a list of physical volumes that would be scavenged, separated
by spaces.  The -check control argument is the default for active
function usage, i.e., scavenging is not done.
