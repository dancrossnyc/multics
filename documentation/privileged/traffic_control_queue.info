02/28/85  traffic_control_queue, tcq

Syntax as a command:  tcq {-control_arg}


Function:  prints out the state of the traffic control queue at the
time of the call.


Control arguments:
 -all
   print information about all processes.  The default is to print
   information only for processes in ready queues.


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_.


Notes:  The following items are printed out by the
traffic_control_queue command.
avq
   is the average number of processes in the eligible and priority
   queues.  This is the average number of ready, waiting, or running
   processes.
elapsed time
   is the time since traffic_control_queue was last called.  This
   equals 0 if it is the first time the program was called for the
   given process.
active last 15 sec.
   is the number of processes that changed state during the last 15
   seconds.


   The following items are printed out for each user presently in the
   ready queue.
flags
   are one-bit indicators in the active process table (APT) entry for
   the user.

The following flags are printed.
      E  process is eligible
      W  Interprocess Communication (IPC) wakeup pending
      S  stop pending
      P  process being preempted
      L  process is loaded
      D  process has descriptor base register loaded
      H  process is a hardcore process
      I  process is an idle process


The flags are preceded by a letter indicating the state of the process.
The allowed states are.

      e  empty or unused
      x  running
      r  ready
      w  waiting
      b  blocked
      s  stopped
      p  waiting for page table lock


If the flag is followed by a parenthesized letter, the letter is the
CPU tag of the processor on which that process must be run.
dtu
   is the incremental CPU time (in seconds) the process has used since
   the tcq command was last called.
dpf
   is the incremental number of page faults the process has taken since
   the tcq command was last called.
temax
   is the value (in milliseconds) of temax of the process.  Temax is
   the maximum amount of CPU time the process may use in the current
   eligibility quantum.


te
   is the value (in milliseconds) of te of the process.  Te is the
   amount of CPU time used in the current eligibility quantum.
ts
   is the value (in milliseconds) of ts of the process.  Ts is the
   amount of CPU time used since scheduling priority changed.
ti
   is the value (in milliseconds) of ti of the process.  Ti is the
   amount of CPU time used since the process interacted, or the tuning
   parameter timax, whichever is less.
tssc
   is the real time (in seconds) since the state change of the process.
event
   is the event for which the process is waiting.  If this value is 0,
   the process is not waiting.


d
   is the device identifier of the device containing the page, if the
   process is waiting for a page.  This is not currently used.
ws
   is the modified value of the working set estimate being used for the
   process.
wc
   is the number of the work class to which the process belongs.
process
   is the name of the user who owns the process.
workclass credits
   is the value (in milliseconds) of CPU time used by the workclass.
