02/21/85 iod_val


Syntax as an active function:  [iod_val key]


Function:  supplies several preset driver parameters to be used in
driver admin exec_coms.  Site administrators use the iod_val active
function in conjunction with the driver x command to set up and modify
these exec_coms.


Arguments:
key
   is a character string parameter name associated with the value to be
   returned.  The key, defined during initialization of the given
   driver, may be one of the following.   For all standard drivers:
   device
      the name of the major device that the driver is running.
   station_id
      the name of the station_id that the driver is running (equivalent
      to the major device).  The default is the name of the major
      device if the station is not a remote device.


   request_type
      the name of the request type that is being run on the driver.
   channel
      the name of the iom or tty channel of the driver.
   <minor device>
      the name of the request type that is being processed on the minor
      device.
   rqt_string
      a string of request type names, separated by spaces, of all
      (printer, punch, etc) request types the driver can process.  This
      key is equivalent to the request_type key if the driver is
      running only one minor device.


For remote drivers:
   request_type
      the request type for a single printer device, if present.
   pun_rqt
      the request type for a single punch device, if present.


Notes:  If a key is given that has not been defined, the string
"undefined "  is returned.
