04/05/85 retrieve_from_volume

Syntax as a command:  retrieve_from_volume {-control_args}


Function:  processes queued retrieval requests.  This command can be
operated in an automatic or step mode.  It must be run from a process
that has access to the retrieval queues located in
>daemon_dir_dir>volume_retriever, the volume logs and contents segments
produced by the volume dumper, and the ring 0 gates hc_backup_ and
system_privilege_.


Control arguments:
-accounting
   specifies that accounting data is to be collected in the directory
   >sc1>volume_backup_accounts for later processing.  The default is
   off.  This control argument is optional.
-all, -a
   specifies that all queues are to be processed.  This is the default.
-error_on
   specifies that all error messages are to be written to the switch
   error_output as well as the file retv_err.mm/dd/yy.hhmm.s.  The
   default is off.


-input_volume_desc i_att_desc
   where i_att_desc is used to replace the default attach description
   "tape_mult_ ^a -system.  The dump volume name is inserted in the
   attach description at the first occurrence of the string "^a" in the
   attach description.
-list
   lists all requests in the private queue and the options for each
   request.
-long
   logs all requests in the error file.
-manual
   specifies that the dump volumes are requested by the volume
   retriever, rather than being automatically determined.  If there are
   no more dump volumes to read, the operator should type a period (.).


-queue N, -q N
   specifies the queue that requests are to be taken from.  If not
   specified, all queues are searched.
-step
   specifies that each request in the queue is to be printed on the
   terminal before processing so that the operator can decide if he
   wishes to proceed.  If not specified, each request is processed
   until the queue is exhausted.  See "Notes" below for more
   information.
-working_dir, -wd
   specifies that the volume backup databases are to be searched for
   relative to the working directory.  The default is to search
   relative to the >ddd>volume_backup directory.  This control argument
   is optional.


Notes:  If the -step control argument is specified, each retrieval
request is printed and the retriever waits for the user to type one of
the following commands:
proceed, p
   do the retrieval request and delete the request from the queue.
skip, s
   skip the retrieval request but leave the request in the queue.
cancel, c
   do not process the retrieval request and delete it from the queue.


quit, q
   stop processing and return to command level.
help, h
   print out the acceptable arguments to the -control control argument.

A list operation only lists the retrieval requests remaining.  It does
not process them.
