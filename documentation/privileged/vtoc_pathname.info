02/28/85 vtoc_pathname

Syntax as a command:  vtoc_pathname volname vtocx {-control_arg}
vtoc_pathname pvtx vtocx {-control_arg}


Function:  determines the pathname of a segment from the location of
its VTOC entry (VTOCE).  Specify the location of the VTOCE by giving
its volume name (or physical volume table index, if known) and an index
into the VTOC of that volume.


Arguments:
volname
   is the physical volume name of the volume on which the VTOCE
   resides.  This volume must be mounted and must be part of a mounted
   logical volume.
pvtx
   is the physical volume table index of the volume on which the VTOCE
   resides, if known.  is the VTOC index of the VTOCE.  You must give
   it in octal.
vtocx
   is the VTOC index of the VTOCE.  You must give it in octal.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the printing of an error message when the VTOCE is free.


Access required:  You need access to the phcs_ gate, since it must copy
directories.


Notes:  Your process must have status access to each of the containing
directories of the segment.  The command supplies "-NO-ACCESS-" as the
entryname at the level at which further access is necessary, if needed;
it gives "-NOT-LISTED-" as the entryname at that level if one of the
containing directories specified in the VTOCE does not exist in its
containing directory; and it provides "-????-" as the entryname at any
level below that at which either of these problems occurs.
