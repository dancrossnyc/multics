02/27/85 reclassify_sys_seg

Syntax as a command:  reclassify_sys_seg path {access_class}


Function:  changes the access class of a ring 1 system segment or
converts a ring 1 normal segment to/from a system segment.  A ring 1
system segment is a segment whose access class is greater than that of
its containing directory, e.g., message segments such as those used for
daemon queues and user mailboxes; a ring 1 normal segment is a segment
whose access class is equal to that of its containing directory.

The reclassify_sys_seg command is needed only if the site is using the
AIM access controls.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment to be reclassified.
access_class
   is the access class (sensitivity level and category) to be assigned
   to the segment.  Use the print_auth_names command for a list of
   valid access class values.  See the Multics Programmer's Reference
   manual, Order No.  AG91, for a detailed discussion of the AIM
   mechanism.


Access required:  The user must have access to the
system_privilege_gate to use the command.  Additionally, the user must
have modify permission specified on the acl of the containing
directory.  However, the reclassification is performed without checking
the validation level of the process.  Therefore, reclassification of
ring 1 segments may be performed from the user ring.


Notes:  If the segment is to become a normal segment, the access_class
argument must be omitted.  A specified access_class argument must be
greater than the access_class of the containing directory.
