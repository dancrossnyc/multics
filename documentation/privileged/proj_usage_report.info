02/27/85  proj_usage_report, pur

Syntax as a command:  pur {Project_id} {-control_args}


Function:  prints a project usage report for the current billing
period.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project.  If this argument is not given,
   the project under which the project administrator is currently
   logged in is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints reports in one short line per user.
-long, -lg
   prints detailed information about per shift, per absentee, per
   device, and I/O daemon queue usage.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.
-pathname path, -pn path
   is the pathname of a PDT.  The pdt suffix must be given.  This
   control argument is used to print a PDT not currently being used by
   the answering service.  If this control argument is specified, the
   Project_id argument may not be given.


-reverse, -rev
   reverses the order of the sort.
-sort XX
   sorts output according to XX, where XX can be the string:

         name
         usage
         rem
         limit
         fraction_used

   to specify users' names, usage, remainder, limits, or entries in
   order of ratio between usage and limit.  Only one string may be
   specified.  The default prints the PDT as is.


-total, -tt
   does not print a line for each user; rather prints a totals line
   (plus any other lines specified by other arguments).
-user Person_id
   prints information on only the user specified by Person_id.


Access required:  The user must have read access on the PDT; usually
only project administrators have such access.


Notes:  If neither the -brief nor -long control argument is given, the
report printed contains one detail summary line for each user.

See also the print_pdt command to get more detailed information about
each user and the display_account_status command to obtain a summary of
the charges accrued to the project.
