02/27/85 set_x25_packet_threshold

Syntax as a command:  set_x25_packet_threshold channel_name packet_size


Function:  sets the minimum size of X.25 "long" packets.  Packets of
this size or larger are given lower priority than short packets.


Arguments:
channel_name
   is the name of an X.25 multiplexer channel.
packet_size
   is the minimum length of a long packet, in characters.


Access required:  Use of this command requires access to the hphcs_
gate.


Notes:  If packet_size is set larger than the maximum packet size in
use by the multiplexer, no packets are given preferential treatment on
the basis of size.  The initial value of the minimum long packet size
is determined by the "packet_threshold" parameter in the terminal type
definition for the multiplexer.  The present value of the parameter,
and the maximum size for all packets, is included in the output from
the tty_dump command.
