02/26/85 print_pnt

Syntax as a command:  print_pnt {Person_id} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the contents of a binary person name table (PNT) in a
readable form on the administrator's terminal.  Note that, while
portions of the user entry in the PNT are stored in encrypted form, any
encryption algorithm is susceptible to a sophisticated,
computer-assisted code-breaking effort.  Therefore the System
Administrator should ensure that access to the PNT is as restricted as
possible.  In general, only the SysAdmin and SysDaemon projects should
have access to the PNT.


Arguments:
Person_id
   specifies the person whose PNT entry is to be printed.  If this
   argument is omitted, the entire PNT is printed.


Control arguments:
-brief
   makes no attempt to access information in the user registration file
   (URF).
-force_no_password_info
   same as -no_password_info, but additionally causes the rejection of
   the -password_info control argument for this invocation of
   print_pnt.  This control argument can be used to ensure that limited
   system administrators cannot obtain password information.


-no_password_info
   suppresses the display of information about good or bad passwords
   and the date of password change.  The rest of the PNT/URF entry is
   displayed.
-password_info
   displays any information about good or bad passwords and the date of
   password change with the rest of the PNT/URF entry.  (Default)
