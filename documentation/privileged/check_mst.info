03/15/84  check_mst

Syntax:  check_mst REEL_NAME {-control_args}
    or:  check_mst -file MST_FILE_NAME {-control_args}
    or:  check_mst -tape REEL_NAME {-control_args}
    or:  check_mst OUTPUT_FILE_NAME


Function: scans a Multics system tape (MST), producing a report on the
segments it defines and checking for certain errors and
inconsistencies.


Arguments:
REEL_NAME
   is the name of the reel to be checked containing an MST written
   with generate_mst.
MST_FILE_NAME
   is the pathname of the file created by generate_mst -file.
OUTPUT_FILE_NAME
   is the name to be given to the output file if the input file has
   already been attached by generate_mst -hold.


Control arguments:
-density N, -den N
   specifies the recorded density of the MST.
-severity N, -sv N
   specifies the minimum severity of errors to be printed.


Notes on output format:  The check_mst command produces an output file
named REEL_NAME.ckrout (or OUTPUT_FILE_NAME.ckrout) that contains a
list of the segments on the tape, as well as diagnostic information.
For each segment there is an entry of the form:

   PRIMARY_NAME SEGNO (W, R, E) ATTRIBUTES1
    NAME2              ATTRIBUTES2
    NAME3              ATTRIBUTES3
    NAME4              PATHNAME
    NAME5                ...              ...
    ...                  ...              ...
    ACL LIST             ...


where--
PRIMARY_NAME
   is the primary name of the segment.
NAME1...NAMEN
   are additional names of the segment.  Names that are not printed to
   the left of ATTRIBUTES are printed in a third column.
W, R, E
   are the segment ring brackets, in the conventional order.
ATTRIBUTES1
   are the standard SDW access attributes for the segment: read,
   execute, write, privileged, encacheable, gate, and wired.  The gate
   attribute is derived from the ring brackets.


ATTRIBUTES2
   are chosen from:
   init seg
      a segment that is deleted at the end of system initialization.
   temp seg
      an init seg that is deleted when its collection is complete.
   per process
      segments in the Initializer's process directory.
   firmware
      segments that contain MPC firmware images.


ATTRIBUTES3
   indicate that the segment has one of the following types of storage
   allocated or that no storage is allocated:
   wired length
      is the amount of memory used rounded up to an even 16-word
      boundary.  This attribute is only meaningful for segments loaded
      before paging has been initialized.
   paged length
      is the length in pages of a segment that is either loaded after
      paging is initialized or that is made paged.  The latter results
      in entries for both wired length and paged length.
   max length
      is a standard file system max length and is set for segments
      that grow dynamically.


PATHNAME
   is any pathname the segment gets.
ACL LIST
   is a standard access control list.


Notes: After the segments have been listed a cross-reference is run
over the contents of the tape, in an effort to detect links to
nonexistent segments or entry points or types of links that the
hardcore prelinker cannot snap.  The cross-referencer produces messages
for links between temp segments and other segments that do not exist.
For example, a collection 1 temp seg cannot legally reference a
collection 2 segment because the first is guaranteed to have been
deleted before the second is loaded from the tape.


Next, the cross-referencer produces four sorted lists--
1.  A list of references to entrypoints that cannot be found in
    segments.  These are usually errors.
2.  A list of links to segments that cannot be found on the MST, but
    are present in your search rules.  This is a normal occurrence,
    since many hardcore programs check their ring of execution and make
    appropriate calls.  When producing a modified system tape, check
    this list.
3.  A list of segments that cannot be found at all.  Unless the code
    that uses them is not executed, or unless they are installed
    online, they produce linkage errors.
4.  A list of links to special star segnames (*system, *symbol, etc.).
    A *system link cannot be used in the hardcore, and the symbol
    section of hardcore programs is not retained; thus, any entries in
    this list should be investigated.


Notes on error messages:  The checker detects and reports on several
classes of errors--
SEVERITY 4--FATAL
   the tape is malformed and cannot be read.  This can be due to a
   logic error in generate_mst or tape I/O errors.
SEVERITY 3--SEVERE ERROR
   a segment has run out of space, or the rules for the system tape
   have been violated.  The checker keeps track of the amount of space
   used in the linkage segments, definitions_, and name_table.  If an
   error indicates a wired overflow, then increase the cur_length
   specified in the header file to the size given in the total summary
   in the output file.  If the error indicates a paged overflow,
   increase the max_length.


SEVERITY 2--ERROR
   the cross-referencer finds references to entrypoints that are
   undefined in their containing segments or segments that cannot
   be found.
WARNING
   other errors detected by the cross-referencer.

Checker errors are reported by com_err_ and are written to the
output file.

There is a severity indicator that is zero or one if there are no
errors detected.  It is accessible with the severity active function:
   [severity check_mst]
