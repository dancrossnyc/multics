02/26/85 priv_move_quota

Syntax as a command:  priv_move_quota path1 quota_change1 {...  pathN
quota_changeN}


Function:  moves records of quota between two directories (one
immediately inferior to the other) regardless of the authorization of
the process.

This command is identical to the standard move_quota command except
that directory system privileges are turned on while quota is being
moved.  The priv_move_quota command is needed only if the site is using
the AIM access controls.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the pathname of a directory branch.  The quota change takes place
   between this branch and its containing directory.  The working
   directory may be specified by -wd.  The star convention may not be
   used.
quota_changei
   is the number of storage records to be subtracted from the
   containing directory quota and added to the quota on pathi.  If this
   number is negative, the number of records is added to the containing
   directory quota and subtracted from the quota on pathi.


Access required:  The user must have "re" access to system_privilege_
gate and must have modify permission specified on the ACL of both pathi
and its containing directory.
