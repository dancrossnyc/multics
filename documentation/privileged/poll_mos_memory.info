03/27/85 poll_mos_memory

Syntax as a command:  poll_mos_memory


Function:  reads the maintenance register of each memory on the system
and prints information about these registers on your terminal.  In
addition, if the maintenance register indicates that an EDAC error has
occurred, it is logged in the syserr log.


Access required:  You must have re access to phcs_ to use this command.


Notes:  This command should be used with care on systems that have core
memories.  Unless the TEST/NORMAL switch on the maintenance panel of
the memory (not controller) is set to TEST, the result of reading the
maintenance register is undefined, and spurious errors may be logged.
