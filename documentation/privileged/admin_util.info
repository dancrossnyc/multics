04/09/86  admin_util

Syntax as a command:  admin_util {args}


Function: sets and prints values in the segment sys_admin_data in the
working directory.  This segment is normally kept in >udd>SysAdmin>lib
(with a link to it in >udd>SysAdmin>admin).  It contains a number of
values used by system administration procedures.  One of these values
is a lock, which prevents two system administrators from modifying the
system administration data bases simultaneously.  This command also
sets several values in the header of the administrator's copy of the
SAT (smf.cur.sat, in the working directory); these values are printed
by the print_sat command.


Arguments:
lock wait_time
   attempts to lock the lock in sys_admin_data.  If the lock is already
   locked (by another process) and remains locked for more than the
   specified wait_time (in seconds), then an error message is printed
   and the program_interrupt condition is signaled.  (Default: 60)
print
   prints all values in sys_admin_data.


set key value,
default key value,
dft key value
   sets the variable indicated by key to the given value.  Since some
   of the settable variables are default values of project parameters,
   used when a new project is created, the words "default" and "dft"
   are accepted as synonyms for "set."  The keys correspond to three
   classes of variables: installation-dependent items, project
   parameters, and the SAT header.
unlock
   attempts to unlock the lock in sys_admin_data.  If the lock was not
   locked by the process that is executing the command, an error
   message is printed.  If it was locked by an existing process (other
   than the one executing the command), it is not unlocked.


List of installation-dependent variables: The following variables
   contain installation-dependent items that are printed on monthly
   bills and other administrative documents.  Enclose the values of
   these items in quotes if they contain any blanks or other special
   characters.
b1 XX, b2 XX, b3 XX
   where XX strings, each of which can be up to 10 characters long, are
   printed in large letters by the mailing_page_ subroutine, as a set,
   below and to the left of the address of the bill recipient.  For
   example,
      INTER
      DEPARTMENT
      MAIL


user_accts XX,
user_accts_office XX
   where XX is the official name of the office responsible for Multics
   billing, for example: "Fiscal Office" or "Accounting Department."
   It is the first line of a return address printed on bills by the
   mailing_page_ subroutine.  It can be up to 64 characters long.
user_accts_addr XX
   where XX is the address of the above office, for example, a building
   and room number or a mail station.  It is the second line of a
   return address printed on bills.  It can be up to 64 characters
   long.
user_accts_phone XX
   where XX is the phone number of the above office.  It is also
   printed on bills.  It can be up to 16 characters long.


List of project parameter variables: The following variables contain
   default values for several project parameters.  They are used by the
   new_proj command when the accounting administrator does not specify
   values for these parameters.
attributes XX
   where XX, enclosed in quotes if it contains any blanks, must be
   acceptable to the parse_attributes_ subroutine.  This string sets
   the default attributes for a new project.  The anonymous attribute,
   which allows anonymous users to be registered on a project, can only
   be assigned by a system administrator.  The other attributes can be
   assigned by a project administrator if the system administrator has
   set them for his project.  For convenience, all the valid attributes
   are listed below.  (See the Multics Project Administrator's manual,
   AK51.)


      administrator       no_primary          nopreempt
      admin               no_prime
      anonymous           no_secondary        op_login
      anon                no_sec	      daemon

      multip
audit XX
   where XX is the default audit flags to be used when new projects
   are created or new users registered.  For a description of the
   audit flags see new_user.info.


grace N
   where N is the default grace time (in minutes) for a new project.
   The grace time specified by N is the length of time primary users
   retain their primary status (protected from preemption).  (Default:
   2880 minutes or 48 hours, which really means "never to be subject to
   preemption")
group XX
   where XX identifies the default load control group for new projects.
   It can be up to eight characters long.  (Default: "Other")


init_ring N
   where the ring number specified by N must be a single digit from 1
   to 7, inclusive.  This is the default initial ring for new projects.
   (Default: 4)
max_ring N
   where the ring number specified by N is the default max_ring for new
   projects.  (Default: 5)


List of sat header variables: The following variables are in the
   header of the SAT.
administrator1 User_id
administrator2 User_id
   These two items are the User_ids of two persons who are permitted to
   act as system administrators.  They may be specific people or more
   general User_ids.  For example,
      AMarsdensen.*
      *.SysAdmin
   permits anyone on the SysAdmin project, plus AMarsdensen when logged
   in on any project, to act as a system administrator.


max_units N
   where N is the load limit, which is 10 times the actual user
   weights.  For example, if the system can handle 80 users of weight
   1, the N should be 800.  (Default: 750)

   This limit is usually overridden by the per-shift values from the
   configuration table in the installation_parms segment.  However,
   when automatic load control is disabled (in a special session, for
   example), the max_units figure in the SAT header is used.


uwt weight XX
   is the load control weight for the corresponding process overseer
   named XX, which can be up to 64 characters long.  The weight must be
   an integer, equal to 10 times the actual weight.  For example, users
   with the standard process overseer (process_overseer_) have a weight
   of 1, which is expressed as 10; users who have a process overseer
   that restricts them to an edit-only environment (for example,
   clerical personnel engaged in typing tasks) might have a weight of
   0.5, which is expressed as 5.  The default value of uwt depends on
   the process overseer, for example:


      Weight          Overseer
        10        process_overseer_
        10        >system_library_tools>iod_overseer_
        10        >system_library_tools>card_overseer_
         5        >limited_service_system
   You can give the word "delete" (dl) instead of weight to delete the
