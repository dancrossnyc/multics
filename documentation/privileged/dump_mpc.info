03/26/85 dump_mpc

Syntax as a command:  dump_mpc mpc_name {-control_args}


Function:  performs a dump of the read/write memory of a MPC and
selectively edits the dump, the trace table, and MPC and device
statistics.


Arguments:
mpc_name
   is the name of the MPC to be dumped.  This name must appear on an
   mpc card in the config deck.  If this argument is omitted, -channel
   must be given.


Control arguments:
-dump
   displays a hexadecimal dump.
-trace
   displays an interpreted trace of the MPC.
-extend, -ext
   extends the output file if it exists.  The default is to overwrite
   the file.
-stat
   displays the MPC and device statistics.
-mpc
   displays MPC error data only.


-channel channel_name, -chn channel_name
   specifies a channel name, where channel_name is of the form
   [iomtag][channel_no] (i.e., a14).  The iomtag field must be a tag of
   a configured IOM and the channel_no must be a decimal channel
   number.  If this control argument is used, the mpc_name argument is
   optional.  If both are used, the channel must be connected to the
   MPC specified.
-output_file {path}, -of {path}
   directs dump output to the segment specified by path.  If path is
   not given, a default segment name of [mpc_name].list is used.  If
   this control argument is not given, the default is to direct output
   to your terminal.


-long
   formats output for devices with 132 columns or more.  The default is
   based on output type and can be used to override the file output
   default.
-short
   formats output for devices with fewer than 132 colums.  The default
   is based on output file type and can be used to override the file
   output default.


Access required:  You must have re access to rcp_priv_ to use the
dump_mpc command.


Notes:  If neither the -stat, -dump, -mpc, nor -trace control arguments
are specified, only the MPC and device statistics are displayed.

Switch 4 on the MPC maintenance panel is used to control tracing in the
MPC.  Tracing is only done if this switch is in the down position.  If
the trace table is being dumped to see the events leading up to a
particular error condition, it may be useful to place switch 4 in the
up position as soon as possible after the error occurs.  This inhibits
further tracing of I/O in the MPC and reduces the chances of losing
trace data caused by the table wrapping around before the dump can be
taken.
