11/06/86  disk_meters

Syntax as a command:  disk_meters {subsystems} {-control_args}


Function:  Prints metering output from Multics disk management.


Arguments:
subsystems
   Multiple position-independant subsystem identifiers may be
   specified to select specific subsystem information.  If no
   subsystem identifiers are supplied, all subsystems are
   listed.  A subsystem identifier can be a starname and takes
   the form of:

      disk_meters dska

   Subsystem identifiers can also be supplied with the -subsystem
   control argument.


Control arguments:
-channels, -chn
      Requests subsystem channel information.  This will be of the
   form:

      Channel Information
                  Term by  Interrupt   get_io  Term w/o
        Connects    RUN    w/o term   w/o term  Active   Status
     B36  229327       26         26
     A38   35334        7          6
     B37    3729        1          1
     A39     132


   Connects	- Number of channel connections made.
   Interrupt w/o term - Number of interrupts without terminate
   		  status on the interrupting channel.
   Term by RUN	- Number of IO's seen by RUN polling, this
		  is a non-interrupt drive service.
   get_io w/o term	- Number of io_manager calls not returning
		  terminate.
   Term w/o Active	- Number of interrupts with terminate on an
		  inactive channel.

   Status		- Current status of the channel can be one
		  of:

      IOI		- The channel has been released to IOI use.
      INOP	- The channel is deemed to be inoperative.
      BROKEN	- The channel is deemed to be broken.


-detail, -dtl
   Requests detailed printout of drive information.  It is of
   the form:

  dska_16: PV-rpv       	of LV-root
          #Seeks AveSeek Queue-wait Channel-wait Queued Multiplier
  PageRd  124498  135.53       57.0  9.5%   37.6      0       79.9

-device, -dv
   Followed by a list of device starnames causes selection of
   those devices for display.

-drive, -drv
   Selects drive information to be printed.  This is the normal
   default unless -system, -channel or -header is selected. (See
   Examples)

-header, -he
   Selects header information to be printed, containing lock and
   error information.  This is the normal default unless
   -system, -channel or -drive is selected. (See Examples).


-logical_volume, -lv
   Followed by a list of logical volume starnames causes
   selection of drives which are members of those logical
   volumes for display.

-long, -lg
   Requests all of -dtl, -chn, -q, -sys, -drv, -he.


-physical_volume, -pv
   Followed by a list of physical volume starnames causes
   selection of those physical volumes for display.

-queue, -q
   Requests inclusion of drive queue information, of the form:

 dska_04 Queue: Ave 16.1, Alloc 99, Max Depth 50/280, Cur Depth 0

   This indicates the average queue depth for the specified
   number of queue allocations, the maximum depth since
   max_depth_meters were last reset and the current depth in the
   queue.  Requests are only queued if a drive is busy and/or it
   already has requests queued.


-report_reset, -rr
   Requests normal statistics to be printed, according to the
   other control arguments, and then meters to be reset to this
   point in time (see reset).

-reset, -rs
   Requests that disk_meters reset its meters to this point in
   time, and not print statistics.  A reset is accomplished by
   making a copy of the statistics as of the reset time; future
   invocations of the command will display the difference
   between current statistics and the copy.

-subsystem, -sub
   Followed by a list of subsystem starnames causes all the drives
   which are members of those subsystems to be selected for
   display.


-system, -sys
   Requests that system statistics and optimizing information be
   printed, in the form:

 FREE Queue: Ave 9.9, Alloc 31060, Max Depth 53/272, Cur Depth 15
      Stagnate time 5.000 seconds, 32228 PL/1 interrupt services.
      Maximum Depth Meters reset at: 11/26/84  2026.9 mst Mon
    PageRd   Max Load    6, Depth   5 (PageRd), Fraction 0.1667
    PageWt   Max Load 2040, Depth   2 (PageWt), Fraction 0.9990
    VtocRd   Max Load    6, Depth   0 (VtocRd), Fraction 1.0000
    VtocWt   Max Load   12, Depth   0 (VtocWt), Fraction 1.0000
    BootRd   Max Load    6, Depth   0 (BootRd), Fraction 0.0000
    BootWt   Max Load   12, Depth   0 (BootWt), Fraction 0.0000


   This indicates FREE Queue use, stagnation time beyond which
   the system does disk combing and the number of times that the
   ALM driver had to call the PL1 driver to process complex
   interrupt information.  The time that max_depth meters were
   last reset at is given, as is the current status of the
   system-wide load optimization algorithm.

-unreset, -urs
   Requests  that  disk_meters  reset its meters to boot time, by
   releasing its temporary meters segment.


Examples:
   The default invocation of disk_meters will provide information
   using -header and -drive. The first set of information displayed
   is the -header information for each selected subsystem. This is
   followed by the -drive information.

   The -header information is displayed for each subsystem as follows:

 Subsystem  dska: 4 Errors 1 EDAC Error
                  Locks   Waits    %Calls  Average      %CPU
  Call Lock:     969088   20686   2.1346%    0.610   0.02466%
  Run Lock:        5946     101   1.6986%    0.399   0.00008%
  Int Lock:      998154   20608   2.0646%    0.796   0.03207%
  Alloc Lock:    968813       0   0.0000%    0.000   0.00000%

   The -drive information is displayed for each device of the selected
   subsystems. The display varies dependent on device type.

   For MSU451 devices the display will be like:

 Drive      PV                          Ave     ATB     ATB        ATB
                       Reads   Writes  Seek    Reads   Writes      I/O
dska_01  pub01          4194     2762   160      671     1019      404
dska_02  list01           34             38    82854             82854
dska_03  pub07          3724     2309   169      756     1220      466
dska_04  pub04          3565     2358   160      790     1194      475

  This indicates the metering period, the subsystem and lock
information for the subsystem, and individual drive IO information for
all drives which have performed IO in the metering period.  Typically 0
counts are suppressed to highlight useful information.  The drive name
and physical volume name are included in the output.

   For MSU500, 501 devices the display will be like:

 Drive      PV                          Ave     ATB     ATB        ATB
                       Reads   Writes  Seek    Reads   Writes      I/O

dskb_18  pdir04         1939     1850    23     1452     1522

  In this example, meters are displayed for primary and secondary
devices, the ATB I/O is the ATB I/O of the physical spindle, rather
than of the logical device.  The ATB for read and write are the ATB on
the logical device.  ATB I/O appears only on the line for the primary
device of the spindle.

  For MSU3380, 3381 devices:

 Drive      PV                          Ave     ATB     ATB        ATB

dskd_01b fpdir04       4100     4051    34      687      695      345

dskc_02c                277      372    62     4241     3158     1810
dskc_03a root3

dskc_03c                223      416    60     5268     2824     1838

 In this example meters are kept and displayed for the entire device.
However, each subvolume name of the device is displayed with the
physical volume name, if one is assigned.  The metering information
appears on the line for the last subvolume.
