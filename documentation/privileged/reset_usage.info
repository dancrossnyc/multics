02/27/85 reset_usage

Syntax as a command:  reset_usage sat_path pdt_dir admin_sat admin_pdt


Function:  subtracts the resource usage in each PDT located in an
administrative directory from the resource usage information in the
system copy of each PDT.  This procedure modifies only the system copy
of the PDTs.


Arguments:
admin_pdt
   is the pathname of the directory in which administrative copies of
   the PDTs reside.
admin_sat
   is the pathname of an administrative copy of the SAT.
pdt_dir
   is the pathname of the directory containing the system copies of the
   PDTs.
sat_path
   is the pathname of the system copy of the SAT.


Notes:  This command is used by biller.ec.  Projects are billed for the
usage recorded in the administrative copies of the PDTs.  (These copies
are created by the crank, called by master.ec, from the system copies
of the PDTs.)  Meanwhile, logged in users are accruing additional usage
charges, recorded in the system copies of the PDTs.  Execution of this
command subtracts the charges that have just been billed, leaving in
the system PDTs only the most recently accrued charges that have not
yet been billed.

If the system crashes while this command is running, the command can be
restarted from the beginning.
