04/08/86  list_extra_personids

Syntax as a command:  list_extra_personids


Function: lists Person_ids that are registered in the PNT but do not
exist in any PDT.  Person_ids in a PDT but not in the PNT are also
listed.


Notes: This command is useful for checking the consistency of system
tables and listing those Person_ids that can be removed from the PNT to
compress it.  (See remove_user for more information.)

The command also references the SAT in  >scl and the PDTs for all valid
projects in >sc1>pdt.

First, the PDTs are scanned, and a list of users missing from the PNT
is printed.  This is probably due to errors by project or accounting
administrators.  Then a list of Person_ids in the PNT but not in the
PDTs is printed.

This command is expensive.  Therefore run it on absentee or at least
using file_output (see the Multics Commands and Active Functions
manual, AG92) so that the results can be saved.
