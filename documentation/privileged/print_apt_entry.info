02/26/85  print_apt_entry, pae

Syntax as a command:  pae {identifiers} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [pae APTE_item]


Function:  prints one or more Active Process Table Entries (APTEs).
Each APTE can be printed in octal form, interpreted form, or both.  As
an active function, it returns individual items from the APTE.


Arguments:
identifiers
   can be User_ids, channel names, or process IDs.  The three types of
   identifier are distinguished from one another by their format (see
   "Notes" below).  They can be preceded by control arguments to
   eliminate any ambiguity (see "Control Arguments for Entry
   Selection").
APTE_item
   can be the process directory pathname or process termination event
   channel.


Control arguments for entry selection:
-absentee, -as
   selects absentee users.
-all, -a
   selects all three process types.  (Default)
-channel CHN, -chn CHN
   selects the user logged in over channel CHN.
-daemon, -dmn
   selects daemon users.
-interactive, -ia
   selects interactive users.
-process_id PID, -pid PID
   selects the specified process.
-user User_id
   selects the given user.


Control arguments for output format:
-brief_display
   prints the heading and only the first line of the interpretation
   produced by -display.
-display
   prints a header and a four-line interpretation of some of the
   variables in the APTE (see "Notes on Output Format").  (Default)
-dump
   dumps the selected APTE(s) in octal.
-long, -lg
   causes octal dumps (when selected) to be eight words per line.
   (Default)
-no_display
   prints the heading, but none of the interpretation.


-no_dump
   eliminates octal dump of APTEs.  (Default)
-process_dir, -pd
   prints or returns the process directory pathname (see "Notes").
-short, -sh
   causes octal dumps (when selected) to be four words per line.
-term_channel, -tchn
   prints or returns the process termination event channel (see
   "Notes").


Access required:  You need read access to the three user tables
(absentee_user_table, answer_table, and daemon_user_table) in >sc1, as
well as access to the gate metering_ring_zero_peek_.


Notes:  If you give no process selection arguments, the APTE of the
current process is printed.

The type of an identifier not preceded by a control argument is
determined as follows:  if it contains only octal digits, it is a
process ID; if it contains any uppercase letters, it is a User_id;
otherwise, it is a channel name.

Channel names and User_ids can be star names.  User_ids are of the form
Person.Project.tag.  You can omit any of the three components, along
with any trailing periods.  Omitted components are treated as if they
had been "*".  The presence of a tag component restricts the search to
the corresponding user table for that user only.


A channel is a communications channel for an interactive process (e.g.,
a.h017), an absentee slot number for an absentee process (e.g., abs3),
or a message coordinator source name for a daemon process (e.g., bk,
prta).

If you supply a process ID of six digits or less, it is assumed to be
the left half of a process ID, which is the octal offset of the APTE.

When you give mutually exclusive control arguments, the last one on the
line from each set is used.  This allows you to define your own
defaults by an abbreviation and to override them conveniently by using
opposing control arguments on a command line.  The control arguments
-interactive, -absentee, and -daemon are not mutually exclusive, but
are mutually exclusive with -all.
