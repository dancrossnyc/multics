Syntax:  copy_liveproc process_dir_name user_name {-control_args}


Function: sets up a process directory for a running (or hung) process
in preparation for use by the analyze_multics command.  It copies a
live process directory specified by process_dir_name into the directory
under the >dumps>save_pdirs directory.


Several hardcore segments needed by analyze_multics are also copied
into the directory.  Two segments are created by the copy_liveproc
tool, pdir_info and uid_hash_table.  These are used by analyze_multics
when examining a live process.  Any target segments pointed to by links
in the process directory will also be copied.  Access to the new pdir
is determined by the initial dir_acl of the save_pdirs directory.


Arguments:
process_dir_name
   is the name of the live process directory to be copied.  If just
   an entryname is given, it is assumed to be an entryname in >pdd
   (i.e., >process_dir_dir>process_dir_name).
user_name
   is the person_id of the user owning the process.  This name is used
   when creating the saved process directory.  The saved process
   directory is named user_name.pdir, where "pdir" is the standard
   suffix.  If user_name.pdir already exists, it is renamed, before
   copying the new directory, to user_name.N.pdir, where N=1.  If
   person.1.pdir already exists, it is renamed to person.N+1.pdir, and
   so on.


Control arguments:
-directory process_dir_name, -dr process_dir_name
   specifies the name of the process directory to be saved.
-name user_name, -nm user_name
   specifies the name of the user owning the process.
-owner, -ow
   specifies that access be set appropriately for the owner of the
   fatal process.  This access is status on the live process directory.


Access required: The use of this command requires access to phcs_.  A
user can copy his own process if he has "sma" on the save_pdirs
directory and access to phcs_.  If the live process doesn't belong to
the process doing the copying, access to the hphcs_ gate is required,
along with s access to >pdd and sma access to the target process
directory.  When copying a process at a different authorization level
than the process doing the copying, access to the system_privilege_
gate is required.


Examples:
