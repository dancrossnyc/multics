11/06/89  poll_mpc

Syntax as a command:  poll_mpc {mpc_list} {-control_args}


Function:  initiates and controls automatic polling of MPCs.  Polling
consists of reading statistics on device usage and errors from the MPC
memory and logging it in either the syserr log or a file.  If an error
condition is detected, a message is entered in the syserr_log with a
code of 3.  This sounds the bootload console alarm and prints the
message in the bootload console log on a normally configured system.
This command sets up timers and event call handlers within the process.
Once initiated, MPC polling is performed periodically, independent of
whatever else is going on in the process.  This command is used by the
initializer or a daemon; Utility.SysDaemon is recommended.


Arguments:
mpc_list
   is a list of the names of the tape or disk MPCs to be polled.  If no
   names are listed, all tape and disk controllers are polled.


Control arguments:
-debug, -db
   prints extra debugging information each time polling is performed.
-log
   writes statistical information to the syserr log.  Access to the
   hphcs_ gate is required.  This is the default.
-output_file path, -of path
   writes statistical information to the segment specified by path.
   This report is the same as the one generated by the -stat control
   argument of the dump_mpc command.  This control argument can be used
   in conjunction with -log.
-time N, -tm N
   specifies the polling interval in minutes.  The default polling
   interval is 15 minutes.


The following control arguments modify the polling already in process
and cannot be used on the initial invocation of the poll_mpc command.
-finish
   schedules the last polling cycle immediately.  Once this cycle
   completes, polling is disabled, and a new poll_mpc command is
   required to start it again.  To stop polling without performing one
   last cycle, use both -stop and -finish.
-start, -sr
   resumes polling for the MPCs specified with the mpc_list argument.
   If no MPCs have been specified, polling of all MPCs is resumed.
   Note that the next polling does not occur immediately; it is
   performed during the next scheduled polling cycle.


-stop, -sp
   stops polling for the MPCs specified with the mpc_list argument.  If
   no MPCs have been specified, polling of all MPCs is stopped.
   Polling continues to be scheduled periodically, even though no MPCs
   are being polled.


Notes:  If polling of an individual MPC fails three consecutive times,
either because it cannot be attached or because of I/O errors, polling
of that MPC is stopped.  If three consecutive scheduled polling cycles
are missed because a previous cycle did not complete, an automatic
finish operation is performed, and no further cycles are scheduled.

When the system is reconfigured to add an MPC, if you want that MPC to
be polled you must issue "poll_mpc <mpc_name> -start".

Polling of MPCs has no effect on the users of devices connected to the
MPC.
