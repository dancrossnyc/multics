02/27/85 reset_use_totals

Syntax as a command:  reset_use_totals use_totals control


Function:  clears all totals in a month-to-date statistics data base at
the end of a billing period and reloads the list of reporting
categories.


Arguments:
use_totals
   is the pathname of the statistical data base.
control
   is an ASCII file that classifies projects into reporting categories.


Notes:  Each line in the control file is of the form shown below.

      Project_id, reporting category

All projects in the same reporting category are classified together in
the data base by the usage_total program.  Lines beginning with "*" are
ignored.

The last control line in the file must be of the form as shown below.

      other, category title

to provide for the classification of all other projects.  Up to 3258
individual projects (in addition to the "other" control line) and 300
category titles may be specified.


This command is executed by biller.ec with the arguments as shown
below.

      today.use_totals daily_report.control

after a copy of the use_totals segment (containing statistics for the
month just ending) has been saved for historical purposes.  This
command initializes the today.use_totals segment to begin collecting
statistics for the next month.  This is the only time during the month
when the classification of projects into reporting categories may be
changed.  The pathname of the control segment, describing the
classification, must be given, even if the classification is not
changing.


If multiple rate structures are defined at the site, it is recommended
that a separate category (or group of categories) be used for the
projects in each rate structure (i.e., that projects of different rate
structures not be placed in the same category).  The rate structure of
the first project in each category (in the control file) is used for
computing usage statistics for all projects in that category.

If the use_totals segment does not exist, it is created.  This segment
is updated by the system_total and usage_total commands and is input to
the system_daily_report and system_monthly_report commands.
