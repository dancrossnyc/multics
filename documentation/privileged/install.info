02/21/85 install

Syntax as a command:  install path {-control_args}


Function:  requests installation of a system control table.  The
request is transmitted to the system control process which validates
the request and performs the installation.  A message from the system
control process indicates successful installation or rejection of the
table.

A project administrator can install a PDT only; a system administrator
can also install a number of additional tables.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the table to be installed.
   The appropriate suffix (e.g., pdt) must be given.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   installs all attributes.
-attributes, -attr
   installs only nonsecurity related attributes.  This is the default
   if no control arguments are specified.
-authorization, -auth
   installs only security related attributes.


Notes:  The install command reports PDT parameters that exceed limits
specified for the project in the SAT, but it allows the PDT to be
installed.  If the SAT limits are not subsequently raised, they are
enforced at login time and a message to that effect is logged.  This is
done for the initial ring, max ring, grace time, and pdir quota
parameters.
