02/27/85 reconstruct_registry

Syntax as a command:  reconstruct_registry registry_names
   {-control_args}


Function:  recovers a current copy of RCP Resource Management
registries after a catastrophic system failure causing the loss of one
or more registries.  It assumes that the registry to be reconstructed
is a consistent earlier copy of the registry desired, and that the RCP
Resource Management journal contains a record of all operations
performed on the registry since the time represented by the earlier
copy.


Arguments:
registry_names
   are the entrynames of the registries to be reconstructed.  The star
   convention is accepted.  If the suffix .rcpr is not given, it is
   assumed.


Control arguments:
-pathname path (-pn path)
   to specify the directory in which the registries reside.  If this
   control argument is not specified, the registries are sought in
   >sc1>rcp.


Notes:  An explanation of the creation and maintenance of checkpointed
registry copies can be found in the documentation of the copy_registry
command.

The prescribed sequence of operations is to delete the damaged
registries; copy the desired checkpointed registries into place; and
invoke the reconstruct_registry command to update the registries.  The
command locates the RCP Resource Management journal relative to the
directory in which the registries to be updated reside.


If an online checkpoint copy of a system registry is not available, a
copy of the registry may be retrieved from a system backup tape.  In
this case, the file retrieved must be from a time that is more recent
than the last time the RCP Resource Management journal was reset (see
the documentation of the copy_registry command).

The reconstruction of system registries must only be performed from the
Initializer, in the "standard" environment, before the answering
service is activated.


Access required:  This command requires access to the rcp_sys_ gate.
