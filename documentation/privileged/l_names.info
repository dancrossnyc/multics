03/31/83  l_names


This command is intended to be a tool for those users who update the system
libraries.  Users must have access to the gate segment
installation_tools_.


Entry points in l_names:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  move:  03/16/83 l_names$move


This entry moves all the extra names from one multiple-named directory
entry to another for any number of entry pairs.  The name used to
designate the segment is not moved; all others are moved.


Syntax:
l_names$move from_path_ to_path_ ...  from_path_ to_path_


Arguments:
from_path_
   is the pathname of the segment whose names are to be moved.
to_path_
   is the pathname of the segment to which names are to be moved.


:Entry:  copy:  03/16/83 l_names$copy


This entry is similar to l_names$move but leaves the names on the
segment that originally has them.  Note that in this case the names
cannot be copied to a segment in the same directory because that would
attempt to duplicate names in the directory.  All of the names on the
original segment are copied.


Syntax:
names$copy {from_path_ to_path_ ...  from_path_ to_path_}


Arguments:
from_path_
   is the pathname of the segment whose names are to be copied.
to_path_
   is the pathname of the segment to which names are to be copied.
