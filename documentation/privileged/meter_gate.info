02/25/85  meter_gate, mg

Syntax as a command:  mg STR {entry_nm} {-control_arg}


Function:  is used to interpret and print per-system metering
information for entries in specified hardcore gates.


Arguments:
STR
   is the name of the gate segment to be examined; i.e., hcs_, phcs_,
   hphcs_, ioi_, hc_backup_, etc.
entry_nm
   is the name of a single entry in the specified gate.  Only the
   information for that entry is printed.  If entry_nm is not
   specified, information for all entries is printed.  No control
   argument can be given if an entry_nm is specified.


Control arguments:
-average, -av
   sorts the output on the average time spent in each entry.
-call, -cl
   sorts the output on total calls to each entry.
-page, -pg
   sorts the output on the average number of page faults in each entry.
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.
-time, -tm
   sorts the output on the total time spent in each entry.


Notes:  If the meter_gate command is given with no control argument, it
does not sort the output.

The output header consists of the time the system was brought up, the
current time, and the total charge time (which equals total_cpu_time
minus idle_time).  Also printed is the total number of calls to the
gate, the amount of time spent in the entries that were called, and the
percentage of total charged time that was spent in the entries that
were called.


Metering information is collected only for gate segments defined with
the "hgate" macro, and only for those entries in the segment defined
with the "gate" macro (refer to the gate_macros.incl.alm include file
for these macros, and refer to the source listing of a particular gate
to apply this principle).  For example, some hardcore gate entries are
defined with the "fgate" macro for efficiency or because ring 0 stack
history is abandoned during the call (e.g., hcs_$block); such gate
entries are not metered.

The following is a brief description of the variables printed out by
the meter_gate command.
calls
   is the total number of times the gate entry point was called.


pcnt
   is the percentage of total charge time spent in the called segment.
avg
   is the average virtual time in milliseconds spent in the called
   segment.
pfault
   is the average number of page faults incurred during a call to a
   segment through the specified entry.
entry name
   is the name of an entry point to the gate.
