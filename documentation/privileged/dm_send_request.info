04/07/86  dm_send_request

Syntax as a command:  dm_send_request keyword {value}


Function: enables administrators to intervene during data management
operations by sending requests to the data management (DM) daemon to
perform actions it normally performs through internal interfaces.  This
is an efficient mechanism for administrators to activate operations
that require access to dm_daemon_gate_.


Arguments:
   keyword can be any of the following:
adjust_tdt, adjtdt
   calls on the DM daemon to scan the transaction definition table
   (TDT) and abort those transactions associated with dead processes
   and those that have been abandoned.  This is the same function that
   the daemon performs as caretaker of Data Management System (DMS)
   upon receiving a periodic wakeup call.
adjust_tdt_entry value, adjtdte value
   calls on the DM daemon to check on the specified transaction and
   abort it if it belongs to a dead process or if it has been
   abandoned; value is the transaction index associated with the TDT
   entry.


adjust_txn value, adjtxn value
   calls on the DM daemon to check on the specified transaction and
   abort it if it belongs to a dead process or if it has been
   abandoned; value is the unique transaction identifier assigned when
   the transaction was started.
kill_txn value, kill value
   calls on the DM daemon to expunge the specified transaction from the
   TDT without rolling it back or committing it; value is the unique
   transaction identifier assigned when the transaction was started.
   Any DM files modified by the transaction may be left inconsistent,
   so use this request only as a last resort.
new_proc
   calls on the DM daemon to do a new_proc.  This request is useful for
   setting the daemon to use a newly installed version of DMS.


new_process_notifications, notify
   calls on the DM daemon to send a dm_shutdown_scheduled_ IPS to the
   process sending this request.  The implication is that the process
   logged in after the Multics shutdown was scheduled.
shutdown
   calls on the DM daemon to schedule a DM shutdown coinciding with the
   scheduled Multics shutdown.  The times of each stage of the shutdown
   are calculated according to the scheme described in  the
   dm_system_shutdown command write-up.  Shutdown is included to enable
   a Multics operator to shutdown Data Management via the reply
   operator command.  Administrators should use the dm_system_shutdown
   command to shutdown Data Management, as it affords the full range of
   shutdown specifications.


Access required: You must have re access to dm_admin_gate_.
