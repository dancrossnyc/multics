02/28/85 wire_pages

Syntax as a command:  wire_pages path {first_page n_pages}
   {-control_arg}


Function:  wires all, or selected, pages of a segment into main memory.
Such pages are not subject to removal by the page replacement
algorithm.  Wired pages remain in memory until shutdown, or until
unwired.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment to be wired.  Supervisor segments
   cannot be wired by this command.
first_page
   specifies the page number of the first page to be wired.  The first
   page of a segment is page zero.  If this argument is specified, the
   next argument must be specified.  The default is to wire all pages.
   If first_page ends with a decimal point, it is treated as a decimal
   number, otherwise it is treated as an octal number.
n_pages
   specifies the number of pages to be wired.  If n_pages ends with a
   decimal point, it is treated as a decimal number, otherwise it is
   treated as an octal number.


Control arguments:
-text
   to specify that path is an object segment and that only the text
   section should be wired.  The default is to wire the whole segment.


Access required:  Use of this command requires re access to the hphcs_
gate.
