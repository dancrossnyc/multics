:Entry:  lfree_name:  1983-03-11 lfree_name, lfn


Function:  interfaces with the installation subroutine that frees names
on one directory entry so that those names can be used on a replacement
entry.  It is part of the Multics Installation System (MIS), which is
used to install modifications in the Multics Online Libraries.


Syntax:  lfree_name PATHNAME
         lfn PATHNAME


Arguments:
PATHNAME
   is the relative or absolute pathname that identifies the entry whose
   name is to be freed.  Only the final entryname of the pathname is
   freed.  All other names on the entry remain intact.  The star
   convention can not be used.


:Entry:  restore:  1983-03-11 lfree_name$restore


Function:  This entry point unfrees (or restores) a freed entryname by
reversing the algorithm described above.


Syntax:  lfree_name$restore PATHNAME
         lfn$restore PATHNAME


Arguments:
PATHNAME
   is the relative or absolute pathname that identifies the restored
   entryname.  A freed name is constructed from this entryname, the
   directory entry having the freed name is found, and its name is
   restored to entryname.


Notes:  This entry point calls an installation subroutine that is part
of the MIS to free entry names.  This installation subroutine, in turn,
calls the installation_tools_ gate into ring 1 to allow the names on
ring 1 library segments to be freed.  However, access to
installation_tools_ is no longer required in order to use this tool.
