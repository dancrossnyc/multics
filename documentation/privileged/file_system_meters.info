11/10/89  file_system_meters, fsm

Syntax as a command:  fsm  {-control_args}


Function:
   used to meter certain storage system variables and functions.


Control arguments:
-ast
   prints certain meters about active segment table (AST) usage.
-brief,  -bf
   generates a shortened report.  Those meters not printed if -brief is
   specified are indicated by a plus (+) in "Notes" below.
-page  -pg
   prints certain meters about paging.


-report_reset, -rr
   generates a report and then performs the reset operation.  The
   report can be shortened by using the -brief control argument.
-reset,  -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.


Access required:
   This command requires access to phcs_ or metering_gate_.


Notes:
If the file_system_meters command is given with no control arguments,
it prints a full report.


The following meters, which reflect the activity of the AST lists, are
printed if the -ast control argument is specified.  The two columns
printed by this command contain the number of occurrences of the
specified item and the average time between occurrences.

Activations
   is the number of segment activations

   segfault
      is the number of activations caused by segment faults; also
      expressed as a percentage of all activations.


   makeknown
      is the number of activations not caused directly by segment
      faults, but resulting from explicit calls from the makeknown_
      routine; also expressed as a percentage of all activations.

   backup
      is the number of activations resulting from calls to
      activate$backup_activate; also expressed as a percentage of all
      activations.

   directories
      is the number of directories activated; also expressed as a
      percentage of all activations


Deactivations
   is the number of segment deactivations

Demand deactivate

   attempts
      is the number of deactivations explicitly requested by users.

   successes
      is the number of demand deactivations which succeeded; also
      expressed as a percentage of attempts and as a percentage of all
      deactivations.


Seg Faults

   faults
      is the number of segment faults

   call
      is the number of calls to the segment fault handler to activate a
      segment without taking a segment fault; also expressed as a
      percentage of segment faults.

   activations
      is the number of segment faults that resulted in an activation;
      also expressed as a percentage of segment faults.


Bound Faults
   is the number of bound faults.

+ Setfaults
   is the number of setfaults performed during segment deactivation and
   during the handling of bound faults.  Setfaults are segment faults
   forced when dynamic segment attributes are changed (e.g., access to
   a segment is revoked by another process).

   access
      is the number of setfaults performed because the access was
      changed on a segment; also expressed as a percentage of all
      setfaults.


+ ASTE  Trickle
   is the number of times the vtoce was updated from the ASTE because
   the information in the VTOCE was noticed to have changed during ASTE
   allocation.  ASTE Trickle is a hedge against system crashes, as it
   updates ASTEs into the VTOCEs periodically, rather than on demand.

+ Steps
   is the number of steps taken through the AST lists searching for a
   free, usable AST entry.

+ Skips
   is the number of times an entry was skipped; also expressed as a
   percentage of Steps.


+ ehs
   is the number of times an entry was skipped in the search for a
   free, usable entry because the entry-hold-switch was on.  The
   entry-hold-switch is set for certain segments that cannot be
   deactivated.  Also expressed as a percentage of Skips.

+ mem
   is the number of times an entry was skipped because it had pages in
   memory; also expressed as a percentage of Skips.

+ init
   is the number of times an entry was skipped to give it a grace lap
   after all of its pages were removed from core; also expressed as a
   percentage of Skips.


+ Searches
   is the number of full AST searches required because no entry was
   readily available.

+ Avg. Cost
   is the average "cost" in I/Os of deactivations arising from full
   searches.

Cleanups
   is the number of calls to cleanup.  The percentage of real time
   spent in cleanup is also given.


Force writes
   is the number of calls to force_write.  The three following meters
   relating to force_writes are printed only if any force_writes
   occurred.

   without pwrites
      is the number of times force_write wrote no pages.

   pages written
      is the number of pages written by force_write.

   force updatev
      is the number of calls to update_vtoce resulting from
      force_writes.


Lock AST
   is the number of lockings of the AST.


The following meters provide information about AST lock contention.

AST locked
   is the average real time during which the AST lock is held locked
   and the percentage of the metering interval during which the AST was
   locked.  This percentage cannot exceed 100%, and the closer the 100%
   figure is approached, the more AST lock contention becomes the
   limiting function in system throughput.

AST lock waiting
   is the average real time delay between an attempt to lock the AST
   and successful locking of the AST.  The total real time spent by all
   processes waiting for the AST lock, expressed as a percentage of the
   metering interval, is also given.  This number may exceed 100% if,
   on the average, more than one process was waiting for the AST lock.


The following items represent a table indexed by page table size and
they show the activity and use of the four AST lists.

AST Sizes
   indicates the page table sizes being used by the system (constant).

Number
   is the number of entries of the specified size.

Need
   is the number of entries of the specified size that were needed.


Steps
   is the number of steps taken while scanning the specified list.

Ave Steps
   is the average number of steps taken in the specified list to find a
   usable entry in the list.

Lap Time (sec)
   is the average time for the replacement algorithm to make one pass
   over the list.


The following meters are printed if the -page control argument is
specified.  The two columns printed by this command contain the number
of occurrences of the specified item and the average time between
occurrences.

Needc
   is the number of times a frame of main memory was needed (for page
   faults, process loadings, etc.).

Ceiling
   is the number of times too many write requests were queued at once.
   Not printed if zero.


Claim runs
   is the number of times the page removal algorithm could not queue an
   additional write until a previous write was completed.  If the
   average time between claim runs is less than .010 minutes, then an
   I/O bottleneck probably exists in the system.  If the value of claim
   runs is zero, then the value is not printed.

Ring O faults
   is the percentage of page faults that occurred while executing in
   ring O.

PDIR faults
   is the percentage of page faults that occur on pages of segments in
   process directories.


Level 2 faults
   is the percentage of page faults on pages of segments in directories
   directly off the root.  This is a measure of the activity of the
   system libraries.

DIR faults
   is the percentage of page faults on directory pages.

New Pages
   is the percentage of page faults that resulted in the creation of
   pages.  This happens because the page faulted has never been
   referenced or logically contains all zeros.


Volmap_seg
   is the number of page faults taken on free storage maps; also
   expressed as the average time between faults.

Zero pages
   is the number of page writes that were avoided because the page to
   be written contained all zeros.  In general, pages of zeros are not
   written to disk but are converted to null addresses (an indication
   in the file map for the segment that the page is logically zero).
   Also expressed as the average time between zero pages.


Segment State Change
   is a measure of suspected covert channel activity.

   audited
      is the number of times all processes performed suspected covert
      channel segment state changes at a rate exceeding the
      system-defined limit.

   delayed
      is the number of times all processes had to be delayed in order to
      keep the rate of suspected covert channel segment state changes
      within the system-defined limit.

   avg.
      is the average time processes were delayed.


Laps
   is the number of times the used pointer has gone around the main
   memory used list in the search for a usable block of main memory.

+ Steps
   is the number of steps taken around the main memory used list.  A
   step consists in moving the used pointer to the next entry on the
   list.

+ Skip
   is the number of times a page was skipped; also expressed as a
   percentage of Steps.


+ wired
   is the number of times a page was skipped while searching the main
   memory used list because it was wired down; also expressed as a
   percentage of Skip.

+ used
   is the number of times a page was skipped because it was used in the
   last lap; also expressed as a percentage of Skip.

+ mod
   is the number of times a page was skipped because it had been
   modified; also expressed as a percentage of Skip.


+ fc pin
   is the number of times a page was skipped by find_core because it
   was pinned; also expressed as a percentage of Skip.

+ cl pin
   is the number of times a page was skipped by claim_mode_core because
   it was pinned; also expressed as a percentage of Skip.

pages
   is the number of pages available in the system.  This is the total
   main memory minus the permanently wired down supervisor.


wired
   is the number of pages temporarily wired down.  This includes
   descriptor segments and process data segments (PDS) for loaded
   processes.

Average steps
   is the average number of steps taken around the main memory used
   list to find a usable frame of main memory.
