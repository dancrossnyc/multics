02/20/2017  library_pathname, lpn

Syntax as a command:  lpn {search_names} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [lpn {search_names} {-control_args}]


Function:  returns the pathname of one or more entries in a library.
Archive pathnames are returned in the case of archive component entries
in the library.

This command uses library descriptor and library search procedures, as
described in "The Library Descriptor Commands" of the Multics Library
Maintenance (AN80) manual.


Arguments:
search_names
   are entrynames that identify the library entries whose pathnames are
   to be returned.  The star convention can be used to identify a group
   of entries with a single search name.  Up to 1000 search names can
   be given in the command.  If none are given, then any default search
   names specified for the library_info command in the library
   descriptor are used.


Control arguments:
-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   provides a pathname or reference name that identifies the library
   descriptor describing the libraries to be searched.  If no
   -descriptor control argument is supplied, then the default library
   descriptor is used.  The initial default library descriptor
   describes the Multics System Libraries.
-library library_name, -lb library_name
   identifies a library that is to be searched for entries matching the
   search names.  The star convention can be used to identify a group
   of libraries to be searched.  Up to 100 -library control arguments
   can be given in each command.  If none are given, then any default
   library names specified for the library_info command in the library
   descriptor are used.


-search_name search_name
   identifies a search name that begins with a minus (-) to distinguish
   the search name from a control argument.  There are no other
   differences between the search names described above and those given
   with the -search_name control argument.  One or more -search_name
   control arguments can be given in the command.
-entry, -et
   returns pathnames for only the library entries that match one of the
   search names.  This is the default.


-components, -comp
   returns pathnames for all the components related to a matching
   library entry, in addition to output for the matching entry. (See
   "Notes" below.)
-container, -cont
   for an archived entry, returns pathname for the library archive
   that contains the matching entry, rather than pathname of the
   matching entry. (See "Notes" below.)


-all_matches, -amch
   returns the names of all entries matching the specified search
   names. (Default)
-first_match, -fmch
   returns only the name of the first entry matching a specified search
   name.


Notes: The -container and -components control arguments are provided
to facilitate information gathering on all library entries related to
a given bound segment.  When only one component of a bound segment
archive is matched, -entry returns the archive component pathname for
only this matching library entry; -container returns pathname of the
containing archive; -components returns archive pathnames of all
components in that archive.
