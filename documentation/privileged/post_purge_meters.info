02/26/85  post_purge_meters, ppm

Syntax as a command:  ppm {-control_arg}


Function:  displays information collected at post purge time, if post
purging is enabled.  The print_tuning_parameters and work_class_meters
commands (described later in this section) are used to determine which
work classes, if any, are being post purged.


Control arguments:
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.
-report_reset, -rr
   generates a full report and then performs the reset operation.


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_.


Notes:  If the post_purge_meters command is given with no control
argument, it prints a full report.

The following is a brief description of each of the variables printed
out by the post_purge_meters command.
Post purge time
   is the average CPU time per post purge call.
Ave list size
   is the average number of page fault entries found in the per-process
   page trace list at post purge time.


Ave working set
   is the average estimated working set.  The current estimated working
   set for each process is computed by the following formula.

         working set = working_set_factor * raw_working_set
         + working_set_addend

   The raw working set is estimated by page control at post purge time.
Working set factor
   is the current value of the wsf tuning parameter, and can be changed
   by the change_tuning_parameters command.  Increasing the value tends
   to reduce page thrashing, but may increase multiprogramming idle.
   Decreasing the value has the opposite effects.


Working set addend
   is the current value of the wsa tuning parameter, and can be changed
   by the change_tuning_parameters command.  Increasing and decreasing
   this value has the same effects as noted above.
Thrashing percentage
   is the percentage of page faults that were taken on pages faulted
   earlier in quantum.
Ave post in main memory
   is the average number of entries in the trace list for which the
   page was still in main memory at post purge time, and the ratio of
   incore pages to faulted pages expressed as a percentage.
