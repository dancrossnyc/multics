02/25/85 meter_rcp

Syntax as a command:  meter_rcp {-control_args}


Function:  prints information about devices controlled by the resource
control package (RCP).


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   displays meters for both locks and devices.
-device STR, -dv STR
   displays meters only for the device named STR.  This control
   argument cannot be used with the -lock or -type control arguments.
-lock
   displays only meters for locks.  The default is to display meter
   information only for devices and not for locks.
-long, -lg
   displays additional information about devices/locks (as selected by
   the other control arguments) that is not otherwise printed (e.g.,
   for -type, an assignment histogram; for -lock, four lines of
   totals).


-report_reset, -rr
   generates a full report and then performs the reset operation.
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.
-type STR, -tp STR
   displays meters only for devices of the type specified by STR.  This
   control argument cannot be used with the -lock or -device control
   arguments.  STR can be tape, disk, console, printer, punch, reader,
   or special.


Notes:  If the meter_rcp command is given with no control arguments, it
prints information for all devices only (no locks).

The following is a brief description of the variables printed if the
-lock control argument is specified.
% time locked
   is the percentage of time spent locked.
% time waiting
   is the percentage of time waiting for locks.
% number of waits
   is the percentage of the number of attempts to lock that required a
   wait.


If the -type control argument is specified, the following variables are
printed for that type only.  This same information is printed for all
device types if no control argument is given, and for the named device
if the -device control argument is given.
Total assignments
   is the number of times the device has been assigned during the
   metering interval.
Total errors
   is the number of I/O transfer errors for the device during the
   metering interval.


Total time assigned
   is the time (in hours, minutes, and seconds) the device has been
   assigned during the metering interval.
% time assigned
   is the percentage of the metering interval that the device has been
   assigned.
