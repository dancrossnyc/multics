04/05/85 volume_dump_trace_on

Syntax as a command:  volume_dump_trace_on


Function:  turns on dump process tracing.  As each segment is dumped to
the output tape volume, the volume_dump_trace_on command causes the
segment's unique id and pathname to be written to the user_output I/O
switch.  This command is only useful for incremental volume dumps.  It
may be used to start tracing of a currently running incremental volume
dump process.
