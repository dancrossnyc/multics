02/26/85 print_sat

Syntax as a command:  print_sat path {Project_id}


Function:  prints the contents of a binary system administrator table
(SAT) in a readable form on the administrator's terminal.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the sat to be printed.  If the entryname portion
   of path is given without a suffix of sat, the suffix is added
   (unless the entryname portion is simply "sat").
Project_id
   specifies the project whose SAT entry is to be printed.  If this
   argument is omitted, the entire SAT, including the header, is
   printed.
