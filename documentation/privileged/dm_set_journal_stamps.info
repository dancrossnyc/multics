04/07/86  dm_set_journal_stamps

Syntax as a command:  dm_set_journal_stamps


Function: sets the time stamp for all journals currently in use to the
time at which the command is invoked.


Access required: You need re access to dm_admin_gate_.


Notes: The effect of altering the time to the present subverts the
write_ahead_log (WAL) protocol, which guarantees that modified control
intervals of protected data management (DM) files are not written to
disk until their before images have been safely stored in a before
journal.

Without the protection imposed by the time stamp, sync-held pages (as
modified control intervals are called when they are detained in main
memory) can be flushed to disk prior to their before images.  In the
event of a system crash without emergency shutdown (ESD), some before
images may not be available on rollback during recovery.


It may be necessary you invoke this command if before journals become
damaged, preventing transactions from being committed, or if there is
an unusually large number of sync-held pages, stalling system
performance.  This command provides a means of keeping the system
running instead of shutting it down.  Use this request only as a last
resort.
