04/05/85 merge_volume_log

Syntax as a command:  merge_volume_log vlname1 vlname2 {vlname3}


Function:  merges the contents of two volume logs that describe the
same physical volume.  It should only be used to merge the segment
produced by a recover_volume_log operation with the volume log already
in existence.


Arguments:
vlname1
   is the pathname of the old volume log.  After vlname1 and vlname2
   are combined, the merged copy is given the name of the old volume
   log (vlname1), unless the optional argument vlname3 is specified.
vlname2
   is the pathname of the new volume log.
vlname3
   is the pathname of the resultant merged volume log.


Notes:  The suffix volog is assumed for all vlnames, if not specified.
