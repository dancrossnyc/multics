03/31/83  l_delete_name, ldn

Syntax:  ldn paths


Function:  deletes specified names from ring 1 segments and
multisegment files.  See the descriptions of the l_add_name and
l_rename commands for adding and changing names, respectively.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames that are to be deleted.  The star convention is
   allowed.


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_gate is required.

In keeping with standard practice, each path can be a relative
pathname or an absolute pathname, its final portion (the storage system
entryname in question) is deleted from the segment, multisegment file,
or link it specifies, provided that doing so does not leave the entry
without a name.  In this case, the user is interrogated whether or not
to delete the entry in question.

The user must have modify permission on the containing directory.
