02/28/85 system_daily_report

Syntax as a command:  system_daily_report today.use_totals
   yesterday.use_totals


Function:  prints a report of the system usage for the day just ending.


Arguments:
today.use_totals
   is a data base giving month-to-date usage information including the
   usage of the current day.
yesterday.use_totals
   is the previous day's month-to-date usage segment.


Notes:  The day's usage totals are computed by subtracting the
month-to-date totals in yesterday.use_totals from those in
today.use_totals.  This command is executed by the crank (in master.ec)
and assumes that the two use_totals segments contain the information
for the respective days, as suggested by their names.  The information
in these segments is placed there by the system_total and usage_total
commands, also executed by the crank.
