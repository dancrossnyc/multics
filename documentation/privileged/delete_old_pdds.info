09/10/86  delete_old_pdds

Syntax as a command:  delete_old_pdds {-control_args}


Function: deletes old copies of >process_dir_dir and system_library_1
created during bootload.


Control arguments:
-exclude_first N
   does not delete the first N old copies of >process_dir_dir and
   >system_library_1 (that is, the N oldest ones).
-exclude_last N
   does not delete the last N old copies of >process_dir_dir and
   >system_library_1 (that is, the N most recent ones).


Access required: You need access to the hphcs_ gate.


Notes: This command is intended for use mainly in the start_up.ec of
Utility.SysDaemon.  If the system is unable to boot for lack of quota,
boot to standard and run from the initializer process in admin mode.

The old copies of >process_dir_dir are named pdd.[unique], and branch
directly off the root.  The old copies of >system_library_1 are named
sl1.[unique], and also branch directly off the root.

The control arguments are useful when you need to have the process
directory contents of processes at the time of a crash, to debug system
problems.

If the process running delete_old_pdds has access to the soos
privilege, it is enabled to allow salvaging of soos directories.  Run
this command in a process with access to the soos privilege.
