02/27/85 remove_registry

Syntax as a command:  remove_registry paths


Function:  remove RCP Resource Management registries from service.
This command should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  (See
"Notes" below.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a registry to be removed from service.  The star
   convention is accepted.  If the suffix rcpr is not given, it is
   assumed.


Notes:  When a registry is removed, its suffix is changed from rcpr to
old.

The activity of removing registries is normally reserved to the
Initializer process, which will automatically remove a registry when a
new RTDT is installed that no longer contains an entry for the resource
type associated with that registry.  In general, manual removal of
registries is only necessary in the process of recovery from a
catastrophic system failure and reload, where the existing registries
and the existing RTDT may be out of agreement.  Manual removal of
registries at other times can result in unrecoverable errors by RCP
Resource Management.


Access required:  This command requires access to the rcp_sys_ gate.
