Syntax:  ldc DESC_NAME {-control_arg}


Function:  compiles a library description to produce a library
descriptor data segment.

Refer to "Library Description Language" in the Multics Library
Maintenance (AN80) manual for a discussion of the syntax and semantics
of the library description language.


Arguments:
DESC_NAME
   is the relative pathname of the segment containing the library
   description to be compiled.  This pathname need not end with the
   ld suffix.  The archive component pathname convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   indicates that the brief form of error messages is to be used for
   all errors diagnosed during the compilation.  (See "Notes" below.)
-long, -lg
   indicates that the long form of error messages is to be used for all
   errors diagnosed during the compilation.  (See "Notes" below.)
-trace {on|off}
   a value of on enables tracing of each language rule, as it matches
   items in the library description segment.  off is the default.
-list, -ls
   produces an ALM listing describing contents of the library
   descriptor: DESC_NAME.list.  If problems are found when using the
   descriptor, this listing segment might help in isolating such
   problems.  However, it is usually not needed.


Notes: If the segment being compiled is called DESC_NAME.ld, then the
compilation generates a segment called DESC_NAME.alm in the working
directory.  This segment is automatically assembled by the alm command
to produce the library descriptor data segment.

If neither -brief nor -long is used, then the long form of error
messages is used for the first occurrence of an error, and the brief
form is used for subsequent occurrences of that error.
