02/26/85  print_tuning_parameters, ptp

Syntax as a command:  ptp {name1 ...  nameN} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the current values of various tuning parameters
within the system.  The values of most of these tuning parameters can
be changed by using the change_tuning_parameters command described
earlier in this section.


Arguments:
namei
   is the name of a tuning parameter whose value is to be printed.  It
   can be either the long name or the short name of the parameter.  If
   no names are supplied, all tuning parameters that can be changed
   while the system is running are printed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   if no names are specified, prints all tuning parameters, including
   those that are "special" and not alterable while the system is
   running (e.g., max_max_eligible, which can only be changed by means
   of a bootload).
-long, -lg
   lists the short and long names of the parameter(s),as well as a
   pointer to the location of the tuning parameters in ring zero.
-short, -sh
   prints only the long name and the value of the parameter(s)
   (default).


Access required:  This command requires access to metering_gate_.


Notes:  See the Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.
AM81, for explanations of the tuning parameters.
