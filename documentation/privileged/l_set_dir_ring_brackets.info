03/31/83  l_set_dir_ring_brackets, lsdrb

Syntax:  lsdrb path {rb1 {rb2}}


Function:  allows a user to modify the ring brackets of a specified
directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the directory whose ring
   brackets are to be modified.
ring_numbers
   are the numbers that represent the directory ring brackets (rb1,
   rb2).  The ring brackets must be in the allowable range v through 7
   (where v depends upon the user's current validation level) and must
   have the ordering:

        rb1 _ rb2

   If rb1 and rb2 are omitted, they are set to the user's current
   validation level.


  rb1
     is the number to be used for the first ring bracket of the
     directory.  If rb1 is omitted, rb2 cannot be given, and rb1 and
     rb2 are set to the user's current validation level.

  rb2
     is the number to be used for the second ring bracket of the
     directory.


Notes:  The user's process must have a validation level less than or
equal to rb1.  (See the Programmer's Reference Manual for a discussion
of ring brackets and validation levels.)
