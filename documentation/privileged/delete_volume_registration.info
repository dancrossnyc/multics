Syntax as a command:  dvr -control_args


Function: deletes the registration information for a physical or
logical volume.


Control arguments: You can supply only one of the following control
   arguments.
-logical_volume LV_NAME, -lv LV_NAME
   specifies that the registration information for the given logical
   volume is to be deleted.
-physical_volume PV_NAME, -pv PV_NAME
   specifies that the registration information for the given physical
   volume is to be deleted.


Access required: You need re access to the mdc_priv_ page and sm to

Notes: You can't delete the last physical volume registered to a
logical volume.  You must delete the whole logical volume registration.

volume are deleted.

There is no reason to delete and reregister volumes.  If there is an
error in registration, use change_volume_registration to correct it.
