02/07/85 fnp_throughput

Syntax as a command:  fnp_throughput {fnp_id} {-control_arg}


Function:  reports character throughput for an FNP or all FNPs and
optionally allows the resetting of the metering interval.


Arguments:
fnp_id
   is the name of an FNP or "*", which means all currently running
   FNPs.  This argument must be specified unless the -reset control
   argument is specified, in which case fnp_id must not be specified.


Control arguments:  may be either, but not both, of the following.  If
neither is specified, information is printed and the metering interval
is not reset.
-report_reset, rr
   causes statistics to be printed and the metering interval to be
   reset.  If this control argument is specified, fnp_id must be
   specified.
-reset, -rs
   causes the metering interval to be reset without printing any
   statistics.  If this control argument is specified, fnp_id must be
   omitted.


Notes:  The start of the metering interval in effect is measured from
the time the FNP was last booted, or from the time the interval was
last reset, whichever was the most recent event.

The reset action of the -report_reset control argument applies to the
metering interval for all FNPs, even though the command invocation is
specific to the statistics for a particular FNP.
