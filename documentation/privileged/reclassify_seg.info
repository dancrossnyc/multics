02/27/85 reclassify_seg

Syntax as a command:  reclassify_seg path


Function:  sets the access class of a segment equal to the access class
of its containing directory.

The reclassify_seg command is needed only if the site is using the AIM
access controls.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment to be reclassified.


Access required:  The user must have access to the
system_privilege_gate to use this command.  Additionally, the user must
have modify permission specified on the ACL of the containing
directory.  However, the reclassification is performed without checking
the validation level of the process.  Therefore, reclassification of
ring 1 segments may be performed from the user ring.


Notes:  This command corrects one of the possible inconsistencies that
could cause a directory to be marked security-out-of-service by the
salvager.  However, the directory is not placed back into service by
this command.  (See the reset_soos command for that function.)

When the specified pathname is a ring 1 system segment (i.e., a segment
whose access class is greater than that of its containing directory),
this command makes it a ring 1 normal segment (i.e., a segment whose
access class is equal to that of its containing directory).
