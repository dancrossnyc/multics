08/11/87 list_proc_required

Syntax as a command:  list_proc_required {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [list_proc_required {control_arg}]


Function:  determines the group of CPUs on which the invoking process
can be run or the default group of CPUs for all processes that have not
requested specific CPUs.


Control arguments:
-priv
   indicates that this command applies to the default group of CPUs for
   processes that have not requested specific CPUs.  If omitted, this
   command applies to the group of CPUs for the invoking process only.


Access required:  This command requires access to
>sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs.  If -priv is used, access to
phcs_ or metering_gate_ is also required.


Notes:  When invoked as a command without the -priv control argument,
list_proc_required indicates that the set of CPUs needed for this
process is the system default by printing "(default)" following the
list of CPUs.  This information is not provided when list_proc_required
is invoked as an active function.  If invoked as an active function, it
returns a string of CPU tags that represent the group of CPUs requested
(e.g., "ABCF").

This command prints the list of CPUs required as an uppercase string.
If invoked as an active function, it prints the returned list of CPU
tags in uppercase.
