02/26/85  ms_create, mscr

Syntax as a command:  mscr paths


Function:  creates a queue message segment with a specified name in a
specified directory.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of queues to be created.


Access required:  The user must have modify and append permission on
the directory in which he is creating a queue.


Notes:  If pathi does not have the ms suffix, it is assumed.

If the creation of a queue would introduce a duplication of names
within the directory, and if the old queue has only one name, the user
is interrogated as to whether he wishes the old queue to be deleted.
If the user answers "no", no action is taken.  If the old queue has
multiple names, the conflicting name is removed and a message to that
effect is issued to the user.

The extended access placed on a new queue message segment is

      adros     user who created the queue
      ao        *.SysDaemon.*

For more information on extended access, see the ms_set_acl command in
this document.
