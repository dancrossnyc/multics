02/28/85 write_user_usage_report

Syntax as a command:  write_user_usage_report sat_path pdt_dir reqfile
   projfile miscfile


Function:  produces one or more pages for each project, giving the
usage for the month for all users.


Arguments:
sat_path
   is the pathname of a copy of the SAT.  This data base contains a
   list indicating the valid projects and the projects deleted during
   the month.
pdt_dir
   is the pathname of the directory where the copies of the PDTs are
   found.  These segments contain per-user virtual CPU, memory units,
   and terminal usage for each project.
reqfile
   is the pathname of the reqfile segment.  This segment contains
   per-account requisition information.


projfile
   is the pathname of the projfile segment.  This segment contains
   per-project information.
miscfile
   is the pathname of the miscfile segment.  This segment contains
   miscellaneous charges and detailed information for the month for
   each project.


Notes:  The command writes its output on four switches, named:
long_bill, mailing_copy, short_bill, and both_bills.  These switches
must have been previously attached (all I/O attachments are the
responsibility of the caller).  Output intended for both the long and
short versions of the bill is written on the both_bills switch.  The
long version of the bill is written on the long_bill switch.  This
version has from one to four sections per project to include.

      summary of total charges (one line per user)
      summary of interactive charges (one line per shift per user)
      summary of interactive charges (one line per queue per user)
      summary of I/O daemon charges (one line per queue per user)


The mailing copy version of the bill (written on the mailing_copy
switch) includes all of the above, plus the following.

1. Page containing the mailing address of the intended recipient
   precedes the section for each project.

2. Current billing rates at the site are printed at the end of the
   total-charge summary.

3. Contents of the billing_footnote segment (if it exists) are printed
   in the total-charge summary, after the billing rates.  The
   billing_footnote segment contains announcement material for all
   project supervisors.


The short version of the bill (written on the short_bill switch)
consists of the per-project total-charge summary followed by a grand
total page.

If a user entry appears in a PDT for which there is no reqfile or
projfile entry, the command types out an error message and aborts.

If the calculated total dollar figure for an account (the sum of the
user dollar figures in the PDT entries) does not match the total dollar
figure kept in the reqfile, an error message is printed giving both
totals, and the command continues using the total dollar figure from
reqfile.


It should be noted that, since the charges for each user are computed
and stored as floating-point binary numbers, some rounding occurs
during the conversion of each user's usage figures to dollars and cents
for printing.  Thus, discrepancies occur between the sum of the printed
user usage figures and the total usage figure for the account.  The
total figure is the one that is billed.

This command is used by biller.ec to create the long_bill, short_bill,
and mailing_copy segments.

The operation of this command depends on the proper attachment of the
I/O switches (by biller.ec).
