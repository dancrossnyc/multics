03/27/85 mos_edac_summary

Syntax as a command:  mos_edac_summary {-control_args}


Function:  scans the syserr log and summarizes MOS EDAC activity in a
brief report.


Control arguments:
-day_limit N
   sets a threshold of N days that a memory chip can fail before
   including it in the summary.  The maximum value for N is 16.
-for T
   specifies a relative time (such as "1 hour") used to compute the
   ending time from the starting time.
-from DT, -fm DT
   specifies the date/time to start scanning the log.
-limit N
   sets a threshold of N EDAC errors for a memory chip before including
   it in the summary.


-mem list
   specifies a list of memories for which information is required
   (i.e., mem a b c).
-to D
   specifies the date/time to stop scanning the log.


Access required:  Read permission is required on the log segments
themselves and status permission is required on their containing
directories.


Notes:  If -from DT is not specified, the scan starts with the earliest
message in the syserr log.  The ending time may be specified by using
-for or -to, but not both.  If both are omitted, the scan terminates
with the last message in the log.  All dates and times must be in a
format acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine, described
in the Multics Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93.
