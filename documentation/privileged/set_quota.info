02/27/85  set_quota, sq

Syntax as a command:  sq path1 quota1 {...  pathN quotaN}


Function:  sets the segment record quota of a specified directory,
without affecting, or being limited by, the quota of the superior
directory.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the name of the directory on which the quota is to be set.  The
   active function wd can be used to specify the working directory.
quotai
   is the quota in 1024 word records to be set on the directory.


Access required:  The user must have access to the highly privileged
gate hphcs_ to use this command.


Notes:  No permission in the directory whose quota is being set is
required to use this command.  It is not necessary that the new quota
be greater than the current number of records being used by this
directory.  This command causes the directory to have a terminal quota
even if it is set to zero.  This command does not cause the inferior
counts of the superior directory to be updated.  It is recommended that
the set_quota command be used only on the root, and that quota be
transferred to inferior directories using the move_quota command.
