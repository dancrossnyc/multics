08/11/87  set_proc_required, sprq

Syntax as a command:  sprq {tag1}...{tag2}...{tagi} {-control_arg}


Function:  restricts processes to run only on specified CPUs.  It can
be used to specify the set of CPUs on which the invoking process can be
run and the default set of CPUs for all processes that have not
requested specific CPUs.


Arguments:
tagi
   is the tag for one of the CPUs in the group being specified.  It can
   be one of the letters a through h or A through H.  If no tag is
   specified, the group is assumed to contain all CPUs (tags A through
   H).  If -priv is given, then at least one tag is required.


Control arguments:
-priv
   indicates that the group of CPUs specified is to become the default
   group for processes that have not requested specific CPUs.  If
   omitted, the group of CPUs specified applies only to the invoking
   process.


Access required: This command requires access to
>sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs.  If the -priv control argument is
specified, access to phcs_ and hphcs_ is needed.


Notes:  If none of the CPUs specified are online, an error message is
printed, and the command has no effect.
