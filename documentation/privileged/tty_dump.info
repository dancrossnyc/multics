02/28/85 tty_dump

Syntax as a command:  tty_dump channel_name {-control_args}


Function:  displays on the user's terminal the contents of the ring
zero data bases describing either the current state of selected
communications channels managed by the Multics Communication System or
the state of such channels at the time of a system crash.


Arguments:
channel_name
   specifies the communications channels for which the state is to be
   displayed.  The star convention is allowed (e.g., b.h202.**).  This
   argument is incompatible with the -user control argument.


Control arguments:
-ascii
   specifies that the contents of buffers are to be interpreted as
   ASCII characters in addition to being displayed as octal or
   hexadecimal values.
-all, -a
   specifies that, for each channel selected by the above arguments,
   information is to be displayed from the data bases of the channel,
   its parent multiplexer, its grandparent multiplexer, etc., up to the
   top level multiplexer channel.  For example, for b.h202.prt1, all
   information from the data bases of b.h202.prt1, b.h202, and b that
   is related to b.h202.prt1 would be displayed.
-brief, bf
   suppresses display of the buffer contents.  Only the addresses,
   size, and flags for each buffer are displayed.


-ebcdic8
   specifies that the contents of buffers are to be interpreted as
   EBCDIC (8-bit byte) characters in addition to being displayed as
   octal or hexadecimal values.
-ebcdic9
   specifies that the contents of buffers are to be interpreted as
   EBCDIC (9-bit byte) characters, in addition to being displayed as
   octal or hexadecimal values.
-erf N
   specifies that information about the channels is to be taken from
   the system dump associated with error report form (ERF) N located in
   >dumps.  If this control argument is omitted, information about the
   currently running system is displayed.  This control argument is
   incompatible with the -user control argument.


-hex8
   specifies that the contents of buffers are to be displayed as
   hexadecimal values, in addition to any character interpretation.
   Each 8-bit byte in a word is displayed (nine hexadecimal digits).
-hex9
   specifies that the contents of buffers are to be displayed as
   hexadecimal values, in addition to any character interpretation.
   The low order 8 bits of each 9-bit byte in a word is displayed as
   two hexadecimal digits.
-lcte
   specifies that the logical channel table entries (LTE) for the
   selected channels are to be displayed in addition to the other
   information normally displayed.  If -all is specified, the LCTEs of
   all parent multiplexers are also displayed.


-long, -lg
   specifies that the contents of any input and output buffers for the
   channels are to be displayed.  This is the default.
-octal
   specifies that the contents of buffers are to be displayed as octal
   values in addition to any character interpretation.  Octal is the
   default numeric mode for buffer contents display.
-subchan, -sbc
   specifies that information from the data base of the parent
   multiplexer related only to the selected channels is to be
   displayed.


-user STR
   specifies that the state of all communications channels attached by
   the specified user(s) is to be displayed.  STR is a starname used to
   identify the users and is matched against the Person_id.Project_id
   of each logged in user.  For example, "*Smith.M*" would match any
   user whose Person_id ends with "Smith" that is logged in on a
   project that starts with "M".  This control argument is incompatible
   with the channel_name argument and the -erf control argument.


Access required:  Use of the tty_dump command without the -erf control
argument requires access to the gate phcs_.


Notes:  The description of the dump_segment command in the Multics
Commands and Active Functions manual, Order No.  AG92, provides
detailed information on the various buffer display formats.

The default mode for buffer displays is to display their contents as
octal values without any character interpretation.

There are two sets of conflicting control arguments in tty_dump, three
with which to specify the base of numeric display (-octal, -hex8, and
-hex9), and three with which to specify character code interpretation
(-ascii, -ebcdic8, and -ebcdic9).  If conflicting control arguments are
given on the command line, the last one specified will be used.
