03/27/85 set_mos_polling_time

Syntax as a command:  set_mos_polling_time {N}


Function:  sets the time interval used by the system for polling MOS
memories to check for and log EDAC errors.


Arguments:
N
   is a decimal integer representing the time in minutes between MOS
   memory polls.  If omitted, the command prints the current polling
   interval.  If N is 0, MOS memory polling is disabled.


Access required:  You must have re access to hphcs_ to use this
command.


Notes:  MOS memory polling is disabled when the system is initialized.
This command must be used to enable it.

MOS memory polling should not be enabled on systems that have core
memories unless the TEST/NORMAL switch on the maintenance panel of the
memory (not controller) is set to TEST.  If this switch is set to
NORMAL, spurious errors may be logged for the memory.
