03/27/85 save_history_registers

Syntax as a command:  save_history_registers {state} {-control_args}


Function:  allows a user to save processor history registers upon each
occurrence of a signalable fault in the signalers stack frame.  By
default, the history registers are not saved, and the history register
block in the signalers stack frame is set to all zeros.


Arguments:
state
   can be either "on" or "off."  If state is not specified, it is off.


Control arguments:
-priv
   specifies manipulation of the per-system state by directing the
   state and -print arguments to operate on the per-system history
   register save switch, wired_hardcore_data$global_hregs.  When set,
   this switch causes all processes to save their history registers
   upon each occurrence of a signalable fault in the signalers stack
   frame.  If -priv is not specified, then the state and -print
   arguments operate on pds$save_history_regs, the per-process history
   register save switch of the process executing this command.


-print, -pr
   displays the current state of the history register save switch if
   the state argument is not specified; if the state argument is
   specified, the state of the switch is displayed before the new state
   is applied.


Access required:  When -priv is used, hphcs_ access is required.
