02/28/85 sys_full_report

Syntax as a command:  sys_full_report {log1 log2 ...  logN}
   {-control_arg}


Function:  is used by the crank in master.ec to update, and by
biller.ec to print, the contents of a segment containing a history of
all instances where a user was refused login because the system was
full.


Arguments:
logi
   is the pathname of a system log segment.


Control arguments:
-print
   print the contents of the segment.


Notes:  The history is kept in the segment sys_full_report_seg in the
working directory (normally >udd>SysAdmin>admin).  This segment is
created if it does not exist.

If given, the -print control argument must be the last, or the only,
argument.  The crank (in master.ec) invokes this command with the name
of just one log segment at a time; the biller.ec segment invokes it
with just the -print control argument.
