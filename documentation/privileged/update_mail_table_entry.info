02/28/85 update_mail_table_entry

Syntax as a command:  update_mail_table_entry name {address}
   {-control_args}


Function:  modifies an entry in the mail table.


Arguments:
name
   specifies the name of the mail table entry which is to be updated.
   The name must be enclosed in quotation marks if it contains blank
   spaces.  If the name is an alias, the associated normal entry is
   updated.
address
   is a destination specifier, that is, a mailing address in the form
   used by the -mailbox or -user control arguments (see below).  If
   this is given, it becomes the new mail address of the entry.


Control arguments:
-acs_path path
   specifies the Access Control Segment (ACS) which controls who may
   update the entry's mail address.  rw access to the ACS indicates
   that a user may update the entry.  If path is the null string there
   will be no ACS, and only system administrators (anyone with access
   to mail_table_priv_) may update the entry.
-alias name
   specifies an alternate name for the entry.  If this is specified
   multiple times, each alias is added.
-delete_alias name
   causes the specified alternate name to be removed from the entry.
   In order to maintain consistency with the person name table (PNT),
   this alias may not be the user's login alias.


-log path
   specifies the pathname of a logbox and is equivalent to:

         -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx

   If this used, the pathname specified becomes the new mail address of
   the entry.
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix "mbx" is added if
   necessary.  If this is used, the pathname specified becomes the new
   mail address of the entry.


-mailing_list path, -mls path
   specifies the name of a mailing list.  The suffix "mls" is added if
   necessary.  The archive component pathname convention is accepted.
   If this control argument is used, the pathname specified becomes the
   new mail address of the entry.
-meeting path, -mtg path
   specifies the pathname of a Forum meeting.  The suffix "control" is
   added if necessary.  If this is used, the pathname specified becomes
   the new mail address of the entry.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix "sv.mbx" is added
   if necessary.  If this is used, the pathname specified becomes the
   new mail address of the entry.


STR -at FSystem {-via RelayN...-via Relay1}
   specifies an address on another computer system.  STR identifies the
   user (or group of users) to receive the message and is not
   interpreted in any way by the local system.  FSystem is the name of
   the foreign system where the address is located.  If the optional
   -via control arguments are not present, FSystem must be one of the
   names of a foreign system in the local system's network information
   table (NIT).  If, however, the -via control arguments are specified,
   the foreign system name does not need to be known to the local
   system.


   If the -via control arguments are specified, they identify an
   explicit route to be used to reach the foreign system.  In this
   case, Relay1 must be one of the names of a foreign system in the
   local system's NIT.  Mail destined for this foreign address is
   forwarded to the system identified as Relay1.  From there it is
   forwarded to the system identified as Relay2, etc.  until it reaches
   the system identified as RelayN, where it is delivered to the system
   on which the foreign address actually resides.  When the NIT is
   queried for either FSystem or Relay1, the query is performed in a
   case insensitive manner.


-user Person_id.Project_id
   specifies the given user's default mailbox under the specified
   project.  This control argument is equivalent to:

         -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx

   If this is used, the pathname indicated becomes the new mail address
   of the entry.


Access required:  The user must have e access to the gate
mail_table_priv_.
