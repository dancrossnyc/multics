07/30/87 disk_queue

Syntax as a command: disk_queue {subsystem_name} {-control_args}


Function: prints the entries from the disk read/write queue for some
          or all disk subsystems.


Arguments:
subsystem_name
   is the name of a particular disk subsystem to print the queue for.
   If none is specified, the queues for all configured disk subsystems
   are printed.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   print the long form of the information; the extra information
   printed in this format is the time of the I/O request, the
   cylinder address and the physical volume name of the drive.
-brief, -bf
   print the normal (short) form of the information. (DEFAULT)
-all, -a
   print all queue entries, both from the live queue and the processed
   queue.
-live
   print only the live queue entries; those for which the requested I/O
   has not yet been completed. (DEFAULT)


-last N, -lt N
   print the last (most recent) N entries from the queue of already
   processed requests. To print all available processed queue entries,
   any large value for N (such 100000) may be specified.
-erf N
   print the disk queue from the FDUMP for ERF NNN.
-online
   print the online disk queue. (DEFAULT)
-read
   print information only for read requests. The default is to print
   information for both read and write requests.
-write
   print information only for write requests.


-record, -rec, -page, -pg
   print information only for page (record) I/O requests. The default
   is to print information for both page and VTOC I/O.
-sector, -sec, -vtoc
   print information only for VTOC (sector) I/O requests.


Notes:
   The drive name of the disk drive is printed for both -long and
   -brief output formats.  In -long format the physical volume name is
   also printed.  Due to synchronization between queuing and
   processing of requests and ring 0 peeking disk_queue will
   frequently list requests which are not for the subsystem of
   interest and/or have already been processed.  If requests have
   already been processed, and the used bit is off in the entry, the
   queue chaining ceases for that drive and an informative message is
   printed.  Queue chaining for other drives continues.
