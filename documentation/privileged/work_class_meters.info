02/28/85  work_class_meters, wcm

Syntax as a command:  wcm {-control_arg}


Function:  prints certain information from the tc_data segment about
each work class currently defined.


Control arguments:
-report_reset, -rr
   generates a full report and then performs the reset operation.
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_.  Additionally, in order for the command to print the
names of the work classes, access to both the Master Group Table (MGT)
and the answer table is required.  These tables are located in the
directory >system_control_1.


Notes:  If the work_class_meters command is given with no control
argument, it prints a full report.

When the scheduler is operating in percent mode, percentages are
computed against two different base CPU quantities.  It is necessary to
understand the differences between these quantities in order to
interpret the output of work_class_meters.


One base quantity is the total system CPU time.  This is simply the
total realtime all CPUs have been active doing anything (including
running an idle process).  In any interval of time when there was no
reconfiguration of CPUs, the total system CPU time is the product of
the length of the interval and the number of CPUs.  Another base
quantity is nonidle CPU time.  This is the total CPU time expended by
all CPUs except when running an idle process.  It is given by the total
system CPU time minus the sum of all idle time reported by
total_time_meters (MP Idle, Non-MP Idle, and Zero Idle).


When the scheduler is operating in percent mode, it distributes CPU
resources among contending work classes according to their guaranteed
percentages.  These percentages are percentages of total nonidle CPU
time.  So, if there are two work classes, each with a guarantee of 50
percent, and the system is 50 percent idle, each work class gets 25
percent of total system CPU time (assuming that there is enough demand
for this to be possible).  In this example, each work class is getting
50 percent of the nonidle CPU time, but only 25 percent of the total
system CPU time.  Another way of viewing this is that the guaranteed
percentages define a relationship among work classes according to the
ratio of percentages.  That is, a work class with a guaranteed
percentage of 10 percent gets about half as much CPU time as a work
class with a guaranteed percentage of 20 percent, assuming sufficient
demand by both.  Further, this ratio is independent of the system load.


The system administrator can limit the CPU resources consumed by a work
class to a fixed percentage of the total system CPU time.  The
scheduler enforces this limitation, even at the expense of going idle.
That is, a work class with a maximum percentage of 10 percent gets no
more than 10 percent of the total CPU time in any interval, regardless
of load.  Excess CPU time is distributed among work classes with no
maximum percentage, according to their guaranteed percentages.  If this
cannot be done, the excess CPU time becomes idle time.

At any time one or more work classes may be a realtime work class with
specified response time and quanta.  A process in such a work class is
low priority until its deadline arrives, at which time it is made
eligible regardless of any other constraints.  The remainder of the
work classes are scheduled either by percentage of CPU time (percentage
mode) or by soft deadlines (deadline mode).


The following parameters are always displayed for each work class.
WC
   is the number of the work class.
%GUAR
   is the percentage of nonidle CPU time guaranteed to the work class
   if the scheduler is being operated in percent mode and if there is
   sufficient demand by the work class for this to be possible.
%MAX
   is the maximum percentage of total CPU time allowed by the system
   administrator to be consumed by this work class.  This field is
   blank if the work class has no limitation on CPU consumption.


%TCPU
   is the percentage of total CPU time actually received by this work
   class in the metering interval.
V/ELIG
   is the average amount of CPU time used per eligibility quantum.
PW
   is the pin weight, or number of free laps for pages brought into
   memory.

The following parameters are always displayed for realtime work
classes, and are displayed for other work classes only if the scheduler
is operating in deadline mode.
IRESP
   is the response time (in seconds) specified for the work class after
   an interaction.


IQUANT
   is the initial quantum (in seconds) for the work class after an
   interaction.
RESP
   is the specified delay (in seconds) between subsequent quanta.
QUANT
   is the value (in seconds) of subsequent quanta.

The following parameters are displayed when the scheduler is operating
in either deadline or percentage mode.
P
   if printed, members of the work class are post purged.


M
   is the max_eligible limit per work class.  A zero means the work
   class has no particular limit.
R2
   if printed, the members of the work class are scheduled in realtime
   mode.  They are made eligible at or before their deadlines.
I
   if printed, members of the work class are given scheduler priority
   after interactions.
LCG
   are the load control groups that are placed in the work class.  If
   the LCG name is parenthesized, only the absentee processes in the
   LCG are placed in the work class.
