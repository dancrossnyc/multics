03/27/85 patch_firmware

Syntax as a command:  patch_firmware path mem addr
   word1...word2...wordi


Function:  patches a segment containing an image of a firmware module
for an MPC.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment containing the firmware.
mem
   is the memory overlay to patch.  This argument can be cs to patch
   the control store overlay, or rw to patch the read/write memory
   overlay.
addr
   is the starting address to patch, in hexadecimal.
wordi
   is a new MPC word, in hexadecimal.  All wordi arguments must be in
   the range 0-FFFF.  At least one wordi argument must be specified.
   Up to 16 words can be patched with one patch_firmware command.


Notes:  The patch_firmware command displays the old and new contents of
each firmware word patched, as well as the checksum, before the patch
is made.  The user is then asked whether the patch is correct.  The
patch is not made unless you answer yes.

Firmware modules can be retrieved from the IFAD tape using the
load_tandd_library command (described in the Multics Online Test and
Diagnostics Manual, Order No.  AU77).  Normally, firmware modules are
kept in the sequential file >system_library_tandd>tandd_deckfile.
