02/27/85 response_meters

Syntax as a command:  response_meters {-control_args}


Function:  displays statistics on interactive response time.


Control arguments:
-report_reset, -rr
   generates a report and then performs the reset operation.
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in the process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at system initialization time.
-total, -totals, -tt
   prints summary information for all work classes.
-work_class N, -wc N
   prints information only for work class number N.


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_.


Notes:  If neither -reset nor -report_reset is specified,
response_meters prints a report.

The control arguments -total and -work_class cannot be used together.
If either of these is used, the remaining control arguments must be
such that response_meters prints a report.


The fundamental concept needed to understand the output produced by the
response_meters command is that of a terminal interaction.  A terminal
interaction is essentially an atomic unit of work by a Multics user at
a remote terminal.  A terminal interaction is triggered by a set of
characters keyed by a user at a terminal, which are passed into the
user ring as a unit.  The activity between the receipt of the set of
characters at the Multics mainframe and the next request by user-ring
software for more input is a terminal interaction.  For a typical user,
a terminal interaction corresponds to a line of input.  Some user-ring
software, however, receives input as sets of characters rather than as
lines (the Emacs editor is an example of such software).  For software
of this sort, a terminal interaction corresponds to the set of
characters handed out by ring 0 TTY software at one time.  If, in
processing a set of characters keyed by a user at a terminal, the
user-ring software blocks itself on anything other than terminal input,
that activity is not considered a terminal interaction.  For example,
any command that results in tape I/O is not considered a terminal
interaction.


The output of response_meters is summarized by work class.  Any work
class for which no interactions were measured is not displayed.  The
following are brief descriptions of the variables printed out by
response_meters for each work class and for the system.
WC
   is the work class number.  Work class "All" represents statistics
   for the entire system.
# Thinks
   is the number of times a process in the work class blocked itself
   awaiting terminal input.  The term "Think" is used because the delay
   represented here corresponds to what is commonly called "Think Time"
   in models of interactive computer systems.  This term is derived
   from the assumption that during this time the interactive user is
   cogitating about the response just received and is formulating an
   appropriate next input.


Avg Thinks
   is the average time in seconds for all blocks awaiting terminal
   input.  This is the average external delay between interactions to
   the same process in the work class.  This external delay includes
   communications processing time (in the FNP), communications line
   delay, and user idle (or "Think") time.
# Queues
   is the number of times a process in the work class was queued for
   eligibility following receipt of terminal input.  It may be less
   than the number of interactions because of type-ahead.  That is, by
   keying input sufficiently rapidly, a user may cause several
   interactions to be processed during the same eligibility period.  It
   may be larger than the number of Thinks because of perturbations
   associated with process initiation.


Avg Queues
   is the average eligibility queue time (in seconds) following the
   receipt of terminal input.  This is the average clock time between
   the receipt of the terminal input at the Multics mainframe and the
   awarding of eligibility to the target process by traffic control.
   The average queue time corresponds to what is called "response time"
   in the output of traffic_control_meters.
Load Control Group
   is the set of Load Control Groups corresponding to the work class.
   Read access to the Answer Table and to the Master Group Table (MGT)
   is required for this information to be displayed.  If the requesting
   process does not have this access, then this field is left blank.


Response times by VCPU Range
   Up to four detail lines and one summary line are printed, with each
   line corresponding to a set of interactions.  Each interaction
   measured is categorized by the amount of virtual CPU time consumed
   by the interaction.  Based on the virtual CPU time for the
   interaction, the interaction is recorded against one of four
   "buckets."  Each of the detail lines represents all terminal
   interactions for processes in the work class that fell into the
   corresponding "bucket."  A bucket is simply a range of virtual
   times.  Intuitively, the first bucket represents trivial
   interactions, the last bucket represents exceptionally long
   interactions, and the remaining two buckets lie between these
   extremes.  If there were no interactions recorded against a bucket,
   the detail line corresponding to that bucket is not printed.  The
   summary line contains information on all terminal interactions for
   processes in the work class.


VCPU Range
     From
     To
   is the range of virtual CPU times for interactions presented on that
   line, in seconds.  "From" is the beginning of the range, and "To" is
   the end of the range.  The summary line is identified by "-----" in
   both the "From" and the "To" fields.
# Int
   is the number of interactions in the bucket for the line.  That is,
   this is the number of interactions whose virtual CPU time fell
   between the values of "From" and "To."
Avg VCPU
   is the average virtual CPU time per interaction for the bucket.


Avg RT
   is the average response time per interaction for the bucket.  It is
   the average clock time required to process an interaction, including
   any eligibility queue time.
Resp Fact
   is the response factor.  This is defined as the ratio of the average
   response time per interaction to the average virtual CPU time per
   interaction.  Intuitively, this ratio represents an "extension
   factor" for virtual CPU time.  That is, it is a factor expressing
   the average amount of clock time required to process an interaction
   with a given virtual CPU time.  This number can be used as a "quick"
   indicator of work class or system performance.


In addition to the per-work class data described above, the following
summary information is displayed.
calls to meter_response_time
   is the number of subroutine calls to the ring 0 routine that
   collects the raw response time data.
invalid transitions
   is the number of invalid calls to this routine; meter_response_time
   implements a finite-state automaton that models a terminal user's
   interaction with the Multics system.  The number of invalid
   transitions is the number of events that did not fit into this
   models.  Typically, invalid transitions result from perturbations
   associated with process initiation.
Overhead
   is the CPU time consumed by the measurement routine, expressed as a
   percentage of total system CPU time, and as the average CPU time in
   milliseconds per call to this routine.
