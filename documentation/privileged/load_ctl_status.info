02/25/85 load_ctl_status

Syntax as a command:  load_ctl_status {group} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the current status of the system load control groups.
It does this by printing selected items from the system copy of the
master group table (MGT).


Arguments:
group
   if specified, prints only the header and the line for the group
   named; otherwise, prints one line for each group in the MGT.  Each
   line gives the maximum number of primary load units, the current
   number of primary load units, the current number of secondary load
   units, and, if the group has an absolute maximum, the total and
   maximum number of units.  Also, the group's current load, as a
   percent of the total allowable system load, is given.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   requests a long format header.
-total, -tt
   requests that only a header be printed.


Notes:  If the priority scheduler is enabled, then each line gives, in
addition, the interactive and absentee work class of the group, and the
header contains two additional lines giving the defined work classes
and their percents, for the current shift.
