02/28/85 system_total

Syntax as a command:  system_total meter_data use_totals


Function:  inspects a daily copy of the answering service metering
segment, extracts system availability and performance information, and
places it in a month-to-date statistical data base.


Arguments:
meter_data
   is the pathname of the meter data base in the form produced by
   as_meter_.
use_totals
   is the pathname of the statistical data base.


Notes:  This command is executed by the crank (in master.ec).  The
meter_data segment is a copy, made by the copy_as_meters command, of
the segment actually being used by as_meter_.  The use_totals segment
is today.use_totals, which is subsequently used as input to the
system_daily_report program.
