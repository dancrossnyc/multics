06/21/90  set_system_console

Syntax as a command:  set_system_console {console_name} {-control_args}


Function:  controls the configuration of system consoles.


Arguments:
console_name
   is the name of the console as it is specified in the configuration
   deck.  If this argument is not provided, the bootload console is
   assumed.


Control arguments:
-crash
   specifies that the system should crash in the event of console
   recovery failure.
-reset
   forcibly resets the bootload console as well as the oc_data
   database.  If the console specified by console_name is not the
   bootload console, no action is taken.
-run
   specifies that the system should continue running in the event of
   console recovery failure.  This overrides -crash.


-state STATE
   changes the operational state of the specified console to STATE.
   where STATE must be one of the following:
   on
      makes the specified console the bootload console and the primary
      recipient of I/O.  If a bootload console is currently assigned it
      will be made an alternate console.
   alternate, alt
      makes the specified console an alternate console.  In the event
      of a bootload console failure, the first alternate console which
      appears in the configuration deck will be selected as the
      bootload console.


   io
      specifies that this console exists, but is not to be used as an
      alternate console.  If this is the bootload console, it will be
      unassigned.
   inop
      specifies that this console is inoperative.  If this is the
      bootload console, it will be unassigned.
   off
      specifies that this console is being deconfigured and should not
      be used by the console software.  This state cannot be used for
      the bootload console.


Notes of warning:  When the bootload console is deconfigured with the
set_system_console command, Multics will crash if the Crash on Console
Recovery Failure option has been selected, either by using the -crash
control argument above or by presence of the ccrf parameter in the
config_file.  The following message will be printed:

   ocdcm_ (reconfigure):  Bootload console deconfigured with CCRF set.


Notes:  If the bootload console's state is set to IO or INOP and no
other console is assigned as the bootload console, Multics will send
subsequent output to the Message Coordinator.  If no Message
Coordinator is available, Multics will act with respect to the
specification of the ccrf parameter.

Although it is possible to run the system from the Message Coordinator,
it is not recommended that sites run without an active bootload console
for extended periods of time.  During the period that there is no
bootload, console sites will be restricted to running only those
commands executable at an initializer terminal.  Failure of the FNP to
which the initializer terminal is attached while running without a
bootload console could produce severe problems.
