02/28/85  system_performance_graph, spg

Syntax as a command:  spg sample_time {-control_args}


Function:  generates a system of graphs that meter information
concerning system performance and operation.  The output can be
directed to a file or to the controlling terminal.  Periodically,
metering information is presented in an output line.  The initial line
contains the cumulative values since system initialization.  Whenever
there is a change in system configuration or any of several parameters
affecting system performance, an additional line noting the change is
issued before the sample line.  In this way, a system of graphs is
developed where various metered quantities are plotted against time.
Because the sampling is implemented by means of an event call channel,
it is possible to use the terminal in a restricted way for other
purposes while metering is in progress.  All output is produced on the
I/O switch spg_output_.


Arguments:
sample_time
   is a decimal integer giving the time, in minutes, desired between
   meter display lines.


Control arguments:
-halt, -ht
   terminates plotting.
-output_file {path}, -of {path}
   directs output to a file called spg_output, or if a path is
   supplied, directs output the the file specified by path.
-short
   compresses the width of the meter display lines (see "Notes" below).


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_.


Notes:  Description of the output pattern.

1. An initial line gives the date and time that metering sampling
   began.

2. A line is given describing configuration and scheduling parameter
   settings.

3. The current state of the meters since system initialization is on
   the next line where the sample time is replaced by the system
   initialization line.


4. Each subsequent meter display line gives the incremental status of
   the meters since the previous line.  In addition, whenever the
   configuration or scheduling parameter settings change, a
   notification line is interspersed.


The following is a description of the meter display line.

Each line contains, in the left margin, the time that the sample was
taken.  Each sample is scheduled to be taken at an exact minute so that
the amount that the time given exceeds the minute represents the
response time.  Strictly interpreted, the time discrepancy is the
response time of a trivial request only if the metering computation is
less than the quantum and if the command argument sample_time is
greater than one minute so that interactive scheduling occurs.


The remainder of the meter display line consists of a sequence of
superimpositions over a grid 100 units wide.  When the -short control
argument is given, the total width of the grid is only 50 units, so all
individual components are correspondingly compressed.  The "Example"
section below shows the output when the command is invoked with the
-short control argument.  The wider display would, of course, be easier
to read.  The 100-unit grid is created by vertical bars every 10 spaces
with periods at the intervening midpoints between the bars.  Over this
grid, various metering quantities are superimposed in the order shown
below.  When the superimposition is complete, the resultant line
containing only the last characters superimposed is printed.


1. Time Usage Percentages
   blank
      located to the right of y to right margin user processing not in
      ring 0.  (The position of y is an estimate; it is a figure that
      divides user processing into ring 0 and non-ring 0 sections.)
   blank
      located to the right of s to left of y user processing in ring 0.
   s
      time spent handling segment faults.
   p
      time spent handling page faults.
   t
      time spent in the traffic controller.


   i
      interrupt processing.
   multiprogramming idle, *
      nonmultiprogramming idle.
   blank
      located from the left margin to left of *'s zero idle.

2. Other Values

   The current average is determined from samples taken at one-second
   intervals weighted backwards in time exponentially, with a smoothing
   constant of 1/64.  The effect is to average over roughly the last
   minute.


   q
      relative to the left margin
      current average of the ready list length.
   e
      relative to the left margin
      current average of the number of eligible processes.
   r
      relative to the left margin
      current average of the response time in seconds, for trivial
      requests.
   Q
      relative to the left margin
      average over a sample of quits/minute.


   S
      relative to the left margin
      average over a sample of schedulings/(10 seconds).
   D
      relative to the right margin
      average over a sample of disk read and write traffic in units of
      pages/(.1 seconds).  Full scale equals 1000/sec.
   P
      relative to the right margin
      average over a sample of all read and write traffic (bulk store
      and disk) in units of pages/(.1 seconds).  Full scale equals
      1000/sec.


   V
      relative to the right margin
      average over a sample of VTOC entry read and write traffic in
      units of VTOCES/(.1 seconds).  Full scale equals 1000 VTOCES
      transferred per second.
   -
      relative to the left margin
      number of load units at the time of the sample.  If this number
      is greater than 100, 100 is assumed.
   +
      relative to the left margin
      number of users at the time of the sample.  If this number is
      greater than 100, 100 is assumed.
