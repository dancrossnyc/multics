02/26/85 print_pdt

Syntax as a command:  print_pdt path {Person_ids} {-control_args}


Function:  The print_pdt command prints a listing of a project
definition table (PDT).


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the PDT segment to be printed.  If the pdt suffix
   is not given, it is assumed.  If the pathname given does not start
   with a greater-than or less-than character, it is interpreted as a
   project name and the PDT in the directory containing PDTs (>sc1>pdt)
   is used.
Person_ids
   are the Person_ids about whom information is desired.  If this
   argument is omitted, information is printed for all users listed in
   the PDT.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints small amount of information about each user.
-long, -lg
   prints all data items in the PDT.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.
-pmf
   prints the PDT in project master file (PMF) format.  The file_output
   command (described in the Multics Commands and Active Functions
   manual, Order No.  AG92) can be used to place the printed PDT in a
   segment for daemon printing or for subsequent use as a PMF (see
   "Notes" below).


Notes:  If no control arguments are given with this command, all
PMF-specifiable attributes and the total amount spent are printed.  The
user must have read access to the PDT; usually only project
administrators have such access.  The following command line is
recommended to make a PMF from a PDT.

      fo Project_id;print_pdt Project_id -pmf;ro

See also the proj_usage_report command to get a brief summary of each
user's resource consumption and the display_account_status command to
obtain the charges accrued to the account.
