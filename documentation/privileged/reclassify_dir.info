02/27/85 reclassify_dir

Syntax as a command:  reclassify_dir path {access_class}


Function:  changes the AIM access class of a directory and all
immediately inferior segments.  The access class of inferior
directories and system segments (in ring 1) is not changed.

The reclassify_dir command is needed only if the site is using the AIM
access controls.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory to be reclassified.
access_class
   is the access class to be assigned to the directory and its
   segments.  Use the print_auth_names command for a list of valid
   access class values.  See the Multics Programmer's Reference manual,
   Order No.  AG91, for a detailed descussion of AIM access controls.


Access required:  The user must have access to the
system_privilege_gate to use this command.  Additionally, the user must
have modify permission specified on the acl of "path" and its
containing directory.  However, the reclassification is performed
without checking the validation level of the process.  Therefore,
reclassification of all immediately inferior segments to "path" may be
performed from the user ring regardless of the ring brackets of the
segments.


Notes:  If the access_class argument is omitted, the current access
class of path is assumed, and only the immediately inferior segments
are reclassified.

If the new access_class is not greater than or equal to the access
class of the containing directory of path, the reclassification is
refused.  If the new access_class would make the access class of a
branch in path inconsistent, the branch is set security-out-of-service.
If the new access_class would make a directory in path upgraded, but
with 0 quota, this directory is set security-out-of-service.  If the
new access_class would make path upgraded, but with no terminal quota,
the command fails, indicating that terminal quota is required for an
upgraded directory.


This command corrects some of the possible inconsistencies that could
cause the directory to be marked security-out-of-service by the
salvager.
