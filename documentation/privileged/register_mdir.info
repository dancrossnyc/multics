02/27/85 register_mdir

Syntax as a command:  register_mdir {path} {-control_args}


Function:  is used to register an existing master directory in the ring
1 master directory control segment (MDCS) for its volume.  This may be
necessary if the MDCS has become damaged or lost.


Arguments:
path
   is the name of the master directory to register, or if -all is used,
   the starting node of the hierarchy tree to be scanned for master
   directories.  This argument can only be omitted if the -all control
   argument is specified, in which case it defaults to the root.


Control arguments:
-all
   specified that the path given is the starting node to scan for
   master directories to register.  All directories including the
   starting node are checked and registered if they are master
   directories.
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the names of master directories registered by this
   command are not to be printed.  (Applies only when -all is used.)


Access required:  Access to the gate mdc_priv_ is required to use this
command.


Notes:  This command is only required as part of an error recovery
procedure in repairing a master directory control segment.  Normally,
all master directories are registered in the MDCS when they are
created.

All master directories registered by this command are charged to the
quota account Initializer.SysDaemon, which is automatically created if
it does not exist.
