08/13/87 check_cpu_speed

Syntax as a command:  check_cpu_speed {cpu_tags} {-control_args}


Function:  performs a relative check of the speed of a currently
running CPU on the system.


Arguments:
cpu_tags
   are the tags of CPUs configured on the system.  If more than one is
   supplied, the values must be separated by spaces.  The default is to
   run on all CPUs listed by the list_proc_required command that are
   currently marked as ON in the configuration deck.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   does not display information for a CPU that is found to be within
   the acceptable speed window.

-warn
   displays a message on the operator's console when a CPU is found to
   to be slower than the acceptable speed.


Access required:  This command requires access to
>sc1>admin_acs>set_proc_required.acs to run.  Use of the -warn control
argument requires access to phcs_.


Notes:  If the speed is found to be less than acceptable the program
will attempt to determine if it is because the associative memory or
the cache memory is off.  Your process is left running with the
original set of system CPUs.

The command runs on a CPU outside of your original set of CPUs if the
CPU tag is given on the command line.
