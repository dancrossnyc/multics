01/14/87  print_configuration_deck, pcd

Syntax as a command:  pcd {card_names} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [pcd {card_names} {-control_args}]


Function:  displays the contents of the Multics configuration deck.
The data is kept up-to-date by the reconfiguration commands and, hence,
reflects the current configuration being used.  The active function
returns the selected cards in quotes, separated by a single space.


Arguments:
card_names
   are the names of the particular configuration cards to be displayed.
   You can give up to 32 card names (see the _M_u_l_t_i_c_s _S_y_s_t_e_m _M_a_i_n_t_e_n_a_n_c_e
   _P_r_o_c_e_d_u_r_e_s _M_a_n_u_a_l, AM81, for the names of the configuration cards).


Control arguments:
-exclude FIELD_SPECIFIERS, -ex FIELD_SPECIFIERS
   excludes particular cards or card types from being displayed.  You
   can supply one to 14 field specifiers with each -exclude and up to
   16 -exclude control arguments.  To be eligible for exclusion a card
   must contain fields that match all field specifiers selected with
   any -exclude.
-label, -lbl
   displays cards with mnemonic labels for each field.
-match FIELD_SPECIFIERS
   selects particular cards or card types to be displayed.  You can
   give one to 14 field specifiers with each -match and up to 16 -match
   control arguments.  To be eligible for selection a card must contain
   fields that match all field specifiers supplied with any -match.
-no_label, -nlbl
   does not display field labels.  (Default)
-pathname PATH, -pn PATH
   displays the configuration deck in the segment specified by PATH,
   rather than the configuration deck of the live system.


Notes:  Field specifiers can consist of a complete card field or a
partial field and an asterisk.  An asterisk matches any part of any
field; for example, the field specifier "dsk*" matches any card
containing a field beginning with the characters "dsk".  You can give
specifiers for numeric fields in octal or decimal, but if decimal they
must contain a decimal point.  You can't use asterisks in numeric field
specifiers.  All numeric field specifiers are converted to decimal and
matched against numeric card fields, which are also converted to
decimal.  Hence, the field specifier "1024."  matches a card containing
the octal field 2000, and the field specifier "1000" matches a card
containing the decimal field 512.

Selection is performed as follows.  If you give no card names, all
cards are selected; if you supply any card names, only the cards
matching those names are selected; and if more than one card exists
with a specified name, all such cards are displayed.  If you request a
nonexistent card, an error message is displayed.  If you give any
-match arguments, those eligible cards are matched against all field
specifiers of each -match argument group; however, at least one -match
group must have all its field specifiers match some field on the card
to make that card eligible.  A similar algorithm is used for any
-exclude argument groups.  So, if a card is eligible and you supply
-exclude arguments, then at least one -exclude group must have all its
field specifiers match some field on the card to make that card
ineligible.  If no match for a given card name or -match group is found
in the configuration deck, nothing is displayed for that name or group
and no error is displayed.  If you give no arguments, the complete
configuration deck is displayed.

Specify all card names before the first -match or -exclude argument.
Field specifiers following a -match or -exclude argument include all
arguments until the next -match or -exclude argument.

No action is taken for misspelled arguments or valid arguments for
which there are no corresponding configuration cards.
