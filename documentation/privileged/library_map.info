02/10/86  library_map

Syntax as a command:
   library_map {search_names} {-control_args} {-output_args}


Function:  selects entries from a library and writes the status of
these entries into a map file suitable for printing.  The entries in
the file are alphabetized by primary name.

A full range of status information can be included in the map items by
using one or more of the output arguments.  Besides information
returned by the status command, the map items can include access
information, object segment attributes and other segment contents
information, quota information, etc.

This command uses library descriptor and library search procedures, as
described in "The Library Descriptor Commands" of the Multics Library
Maintenance (AN80) manual.  When no output arguments are given, the
information included by default in the map items is controlled by the
search program for the particular library being mapped.  The default
map item includes the information most appropriate for a library map.


Arguments:
search_names
   are entrynames that identify the library entries to be output.  The
   star convention can be used to identify a group of entries with a
   single search name.  Up to 100 search names can be given in the
   command.  If none are given, then any default search names specified
   in the library descriptor are used.


Control arguments:
-chase
   suppresses map items for any intermediate links that exist between a
   library link and its eventual target.
-components, -comp
   displays map items for all the components of a matching library
   entry, in addition to the item for the matching entry.  It also
   displays map items for all components of a library entry containing
   a matching entry.  (See "Notes" below.)
-container, -cont
   displays a map item for the library entry that contains each
   matching entry, in addition to the item for the matching entry.
   (See "Notes" below.)  (Default)


-cross_reference, -cref
   includes cross-reference map items in the output for the secondary
   names on library entries that are output.  (See "Notes" below.)
   (Default)
-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   gives a pathname or reference name that identifies the library
   descriptor describing the libraries to be searched.  If -descriptor
   is not given, then the default library descriptor is used.
-entry, -et
   includes map items in the output only for library entries matching
   one of the search names.


-footer footing, -fo footing
   gives a character string that is used in the footing line at the
   bottom of each page to identify the libraries being mapped.  If the
   string contains blanks, then it must be enclosed in quotes.  Only
   the first 45 characters of the string are used.  If -footer is not
   given, then a default character string is used in the footing line.
   (See "Notes" below.)
-header heading, -he heading
   gives a character string that is used as a heading line on the first
   page of the map to identify the libraries that have been mapped.  If
   the string contains blanks, then it must be enclosed in quotes.
   Only the first 120 characters of the string are used.  If -header is
   not given, then a default heading line is used.  (See "Notes"
   below.)


-library library_name, -lb library_name
   identifies a library that is to be searched for entries matching the
   search names.  The star convention can be used to identify a group
   of libraries with a single library name.  Up to 100 -library control
   arguments can be given in each command.  If none are given, then any
   default library names specified in the library descriptor are used.
-no_chase
   causes map items for the intermediate links.  (Default)
-no_cross_reference, -ncref
   suppresses cross-reference map items.
-omit
   suppresses the map item for library entries awaiting deletion from
   the libraries.  (Default)


-output_file file, -of file
   identifies the output file in which the library map is to be
   generated.  A relative or absolute pathname can be given for the
   file.  If it does not have a suffix of map, then one is assumed.  If
   -output_file is not given, then the map is generated in the
   library.map file that is created in the user's working directory.
-retain, -ret
   causes a map item for library entries awaiting deletion from the
   libraries (as determined by the library search program).
-search_name search_name
   identifies a search name that begins with a minus (-) to distinguish
   the search name from a control argument.  There are no other
   differences between the search names described above and those given
   with the -search_name control argument.  One or more -search_name
   control arguments can be given in the command.


List of output arguments:
-access
   displays all access control information, which includes:  the user's
   access mode to the library entry, its ring brackets, ACL, access
   class, AIM attributes, safety switch setting, and for directory
   entries the initial ACLs.
-all, -a
   displays all available information.
-contents
   displays information describing the contents of library entries,
   which includes:  compilation information, object attributes, and
   segment printability information.


-default, -dft
   displays default information in addition to the information
   requested by other output arguments.  This is the default when no
   other output arguments are given.
-status, -st
   displays all status information printed by the command "status
   -all", except for access control information.


   The following output arguments are available, but are probably not
   of interest to every user.  They provide more selective control over
   which status information is included in the output.
-access_class, -acc
   displays the access class (if other than system low), the setting of
   the security-out-of-service switch, the audit switch, and the
   multiple access class switch (if on).
-acl
   displays the access control list.
-author, -at
   displays the author and bit count author (if different from the
   author).
-bit_count, -bc
   displays the bit count.


-compiler_name
   displays the name of the compiler of an object segment.
-compiler_options
   displays the compiler option information stored in an object
   segment.
-compiler_version
   displays the version information for the compiler of an object
   segment.
-copy, -cp
   displays the setting of the copy-on-write switch (if on).
-current_length
   displays the current length (if different from records used).


-date, -dt
   displays the date/time contents modified, date/time used, date/time
   entry modified, date/time dumped, and date/time compiled.

   displays the date/time entry modified.  For archive components, this
   corresponds to the date/time component updated into the archive.
-date_time_used, -dtu
   displays the date/time used.


-device, -dv
   displays the name of the logical volume on which the entry resides
   for nondirectory and non-MSF entries, the name of the son's logical
   volume for directory and MSF entries, and the setting of the
   transparent-to-paging device switch.
-error
   displays messages that indicate the errors that occurred while
   obtaining the status information.
-initial_acl, -iacl

   records used), maximum length (if different from
   sys_info$max_seg_size), bit count, archive component offset, and
   directory quota information.
-level, -lev
   causes a level number to precede each output entry.  This number
   indicates the relationship between a library entry and its
   components.  Normally, this relationship is indicated only by
   indenting the component names beneath those of the library entry.
-link_target
   displays the pathname of the target of each library link.
-match
   displays all names that match any of the search names.

   output.  Normally, no lines are skipped between entries.
-non_ascii
   displays an indication that a library entry contains non-ASCII
   characters.


-object_info
   displays information about format of an object segment and its entry
   bound.
-offset, -ofs

   quota switch setting (if on), a count of inferior directories with
   terminal quota (if nonzero), the time/record product for the
   directory, and the date-time/time-record product updated.  If a

   segment, archive, archive component, multisegment file, multisegment
   file component, and directory.
-unique_id, -uid
   displays the unique identifier.


Notes:  Any combination of output arguments can be used in a command,
since the use of several output arguments merely causes more
information to be included in each map entry.  However, the following
groups of control arguments are mutually exclusive, and only one
argument from each group can be given in a command:

     -cross_reference and -no_cross_reference
     -chase and -no_chase
     -retain and -omit.

The -container and -components control arguments are provided to
facilitate the mapping of library entries related to a given bound
segment.  When only one component of a bound segment archive matches
one of the search names, -entry causes a map item for only the matching
library entry.  The -container and -components control arguments, which
can be used singly or together but neither with -entry, cause map items
for entries related to a matching entry as well.


The -container and -components control arguments have the following
effects.  If a search name is given that matches a component in a
source archive, giving -entry produces a map item for only that
component.  Giving -container instead would produce a map item for the
source archive, as well as one for the matching component.  Giving
-components produces map items for all of the components of the source
archive containing the matching component.  Giving both -container and
-components produces map items for the source archive and all of its
components.

When -cross_reference is used, a cross-reference map item is included
in the map for each secondary name on a matching library entry.  The
cross-reference item includes:  the secondary name, the date/time
modified for the library entry, and its pathname.  The pathname ends
with the primary name of the library entry, providing a reference to
the map item that includes complete information about the entry.


The library map is generated in an output file identified by
-output_file.  If this control argument is not given, then a file
called library.map is created in the user's working directory.  If the
output file already exists, it is truncated before the new map is
created.  Thus, several library_map commands executed in the same
working directory (in the same or different processes) without
-output_file can produce unpredictable results.  In such cases, this
control argument should be used to create a different map file in each
command.


If -header is given, then the heading line is centered on the first
page of the map beneath the lines:

                         Map of the nn Entries

                                 of the

The heading line should be worded with this in mind.  For example:

                         Map of the 35 Entries

                                 of the

                Standard Library Bind Listing Directory


If -header is not given, a default heading line is constructed by
concatenating the names of the libraries that were searched:

                         Map of the 350 Entries

                                 of the

                               Libraries

             standard_library.list, unbundled_library.list,
      tools_library.list, user_library.list, network_library.list

If -footer is given, then the footing line placed at the bottom of each
page of the library map contains the footing character string given
with the control argument, along with a page number and the names of
the first and last map items that appear on the page; if not given,
then the concatenated library names used in the heading line are also
used in the footing line.
