Syntax:  lren path1 name1 {pathN nameN}


Function:  replaces specified ring 1 segment and multisegment file
names by specified new names without affecting any other names the
entry might have.


Arguments:
path1
   specifies the old name that is to be replaced; it can be a pathname
   or an entryname.  The star convention is allowed.
name1
   specifies the new name that replaces the storage system entryname
   portion of path1.  The equal convention is allowed.


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_ gate is required.

The access mode of the user with respect to the directory specified by
path1 must contain the modify attribute.

Since two entries in a directory cannot have the same entryname,
special action is taken by this command if name1 already exists in the
directory specified by path1.  If the entry having the entryname name1
has an alternate name, entryname name1 is removed and the user is
informed of this action; the renaming operation then takes place.  If
the entry having the entryname name1 has only one name, the entry must
be deleted in order to remove the name.  The user is asked if the
deletion should be done; if the user answers "no," the remaining
operation does not take place.
