03/26/85 exercise_disk

Syntax as a command:  exercise_disk disk_type volume_id {-control_args}


Function:  exercises a disk drive.  Maximal arm motion occurs all over
the disk, and data is written and read back later for checking at each
point.  This activity can be used to make unstable drives fail
repeatedly.


Arguments:
disk_type
   a valid Multics disk device type (e.g., d451, d500, and d501).
volume_id
   the label of the disk pack on which the test is to be run.


Control arguments:
-alternate_track, -altrk
   removes the alternate track area of the disk from the test
   parameters.  The default is to use the entire pack.
-device STR, -dv STR
   specifies the device on which you want to run the test, where STR
   can be dska_02, dskb_13, etc.).  Either this control argument or the
   assign_resource (ar) command must be used to attach an I/O disk.
-from M, -fm M
   sets the lower limit of the range of addresses to be tested to M,
   where M is a decimal integer specifying a valid cylinder number for
   the device to be tested.


-no_data_compare, -ndc
   makes no data compare on the read pass; only errors detected by the
   hardware are reported.  This enables testing of a disk pack without
   knowing what data is recorded on it.  The default is to compare the
   data with a known pattern.
-random
   the test performs random rather than sequential seeks; the test
   takes several hours.  This is the default.
-read, -r
   reads back the information on the disk pack, for checking purposes.
   The default is -write_read.
-sequential, -sq
   the test runs sequentially, writing and reading from sector 0.


-to N
   sets the high limit of the range of addresses to be tested to N,
   where N is a decimal integer specifying a valid cylinder number for
   the device to be tested.
-write, -w
   writes a known pattern over the entire disk pack.  The default is
   -write_read.
-write_read, -wr
   writes a known pattern over the entire disk pack, and then reads
   this information back for checking purposes.  This is the default.


Notes:  The exercise_disk command requests the mounting of a scratch
pack.

The assign_resource command must be used in conjunction with this
command to exercise a given drive.  Such drives must be configured as
user I/O drives (nonstorage system) via the udsk config card (described
in the Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81)
or by the use of the set_drive_usage (sdu) initializer command.


When the -from or -to control arguments are used, testing is confined
to the range of addresses specified.  The seek pattern used in this
mode is from inner cylinder to outer cylinder, with M incrementing to N
or the maximum address of the device, and N decrementing to M or
cylinder zero.  When M reaches its inner limit, the pattern is
repeated.  Testing continues until you stop it, by hitting the break
key and then typing the release (rl) command.
