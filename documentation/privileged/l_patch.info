Syntax:  l_patch segment offset value_ ...  value_


Function:  intended to be a tool for those users who maintain the
online system libraries.  It is used to change selected locations of a
ring 1 segment.  It requires write access to the directory containing
the segment and access to the gate segment installation_tools_.


Arguments:
segment
   is the pathname or segment number of the segment to be patched.
offset
   is the offset of the first word to be changed; it must be expressed
   as an octal number.
value_
   are the new values for the locations to be changed.


Notes:
When in ring 1, the user is given rew access to the segment
before the patch is made.  This is done by adding an access control
list (ACL) entry to the segment with the access control name,
"person.project.tag".  This ACL entry is removed after the patch is
complete.

The command prints out the changes that will be made and asks the
user if these changes are correct.  In order for the patch to be done,
the user must answer "yes" followed by the newline character.
