02/27/85 send_ips

Syntax as a command:  send_ips process_id signal_name


Function:  sends an IPS signal to a process.  It is a command interface
to the hphcs_$ips_wakeup subroutine entry point.


Arguments:
process_id
   is a 12-digit octal number specifying the ID of the process that is
   to receive the signal.  You can omit leading zeros from process_id.
signal_name
   is name of one of the system-defined IPS signals; it can be up to 32
   characters long.  The signal names must be defined in
   sys_info_$ips_mask_data.  Presently the defined signal names are
   quit, alrm, neti, cput, trm_, sus_, wkp_, pgt_,
   system_shutdown_scheduled_, and dm_shutdown_scheduled_.


Access required:  You need access to the highly privileged hphcs_ gate.


Notes:  No error message is given if you supply an undefined IPS signal
or a nonexistent process.

The process_id active function is a convenient way of obtaining a
process_id, given a User_id or channel name.
