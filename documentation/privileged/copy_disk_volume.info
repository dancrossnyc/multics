03/28/87  copy_disk_volume

Syntax as a command:  copy_disk_volume  source_device_name
                        target_device_name  {-control_args}


Function: copies data from one Multics physical volume to another of
the same device type when the source is a system-storage disk and both
disk packs are mounted on non-system-storage (I/O) disk drives.  This
command can be used to recover data from a failing disk pack without
shutting down the system.


Arguments:
source_device_name
   is the name of the disk drive to be copied from, in the form
   dska_xx{s}.
target_device_name
   is the name of the disk drive to be copied to, in the form
   dskb_xx{s}.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the informative messages produced by default.
-check, -ck
   causes the target disk to be written in "wrtcmp" mode, which uses
   write-compare DCWs to do the writing.
-error_threshold {N}
   sets the threshold for number of bad pages allowed on the disk
   before you will be queried whether or not you wish to continue
   copying.  (Default 10).
-long, -lg
   prints informative messages at the beginning and end of the copy,
   and announces the location after every hundred cylinders are copied.
   (Default)


-no_check, -nck
   writes the target disk using ordinary write DCWs. (Default)
-no_query
   no queries will be issued.  If -no_query is used in conjunction with
   -error_threshold, when the threshold is reached, the program will
   exit.
-no_trace
   suppresses the trace messages. (Default)
-pv_name name, -pv name
   optional argument to allow specification of a volume name for
   either the source_device or the target_device.  This argument is
   considered a modifier for either source_device_name or
   target_device_name and must appear after the device name to which it
   applies.  For example:


   copy_disk_volume dska_nn{s} -pv foo dska_nn{s}
   copy_disk_volume dska_nn{s} dska_nn{s} -pv bar
   copy_disk_volume dska_nn{s} -pv foo dska_nn {s} -pv bar

   If no pv_name is given, the default pv_name "scratch" will be used
   in the attach description for the volume.

-query
   allows issuing of queries and the chance to respond with an
   appropriate answer.  (Default).


-trace {N}
   prints a message for every N I/Os performed by copy_disk_volume,
   giving the disk name, elapsed time, sector number, and length.
   N is an optional parameter designating the increment for number of
   I/Os (default 1).  The trace is off when copying in page-mode on a
   retry after an unrecoverable read error.


Notes:

Access required -  Access to workspace.acs is required so that large
DCW lists can be used.  Access to the dskX_NN.acs segments for the disk
drives is required.  Access to rcp_sys_ is required in order to attach
system storage volumes.

Error Recovery -  When an error occurs while reading the source disk,
copy_disk_volume retries the I/O by breaking it into single records.
Errors in writing the target disk will cause the program to exit.  Any
errors which persist during single record I/O are considered
unrecoverable, the record is skipped and an error message is printed
with information about which sectors of the disk are unreadable.


The use of very large I/O buffers requires that only one copy of
copy_disk_volume be performed at a time in a given process.  It is also
recommended that this command not be performed from the initializer
because of the I/O requirements.
