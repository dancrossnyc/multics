10/21/87 instr_speed

Syntax as a command:  instr_speed {-control_args}


Function:  measures the speed of a processor by timing a series of code
sequences.  The code sequences are chosen to test the more common and
important sequences of instruction as well as to get a general idea of
the limiting speed that can be expected.  It is generally useful to
select a processor (with the use of the set_proc_required command
described in System Diagnostic Aids, Order No.  AR97) before running
timing tests.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   displays a histogram of MIP rate for 100 passes of each code
   sequence.


Notes:  Code sequences that take longer than expected, probably due to
interrupt or fault action, are factored out and not counted.
