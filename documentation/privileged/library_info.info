02/10/86  library_info, li

Syntax as a command:  li {search_names} {-control_args} {-output_args}


Function:  selects entries from a library and prints the status of
these entries in alphabetical order by primary name on the user's
terminal.

A full range of status information can be included in the output by
using one or more of the output arguments.  Besides information
returned by the status command, the output can include access
information, object segment attributes and other segment contents
information, quota information, etc.

This command uses a library descriptor and library search procedures,
as described in "The Library Descriptor Commands" of the Multics
Library Maintenance (AN80) manual.  When no output arguments are given,
the information included by default is controlled by the search program
for the particular library being searched.  The default output includes
the information most appropriate for library maintenance.


Arguments:
search_names
   are entrynames that identify the library entries to be output.  The
   Multics star convention can be used to identify a group of entries
   with a single search name.  Up to 100 search names can be given in
   the command.  If none are given, then any default search names
   specified in the library descriptor are used.


Control arguments:
-chase
   suppresses status information for any intermediate links that exist
   between a library link and its eventual target.
-components, -comp
   causes status information for all the components of a matching
   library entry, in addition to the output for the matching entry.  It
   also causes status information for all components of a library entry
   containing a matching entry.  (See "Notes" below.)
-container, -cont
   displays status information for the library entry that contains each
   matching entry, in addition to the output for the matching entry.
   (See "Notes" below.)


-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   gives a pathname or reference name that identifies the library
   descriptor describing the libraries to be searched.  If -descriptor
   is not given, then the default library descriptor is used.
-entry, -et
   displays status information for only the library entries that match
   one of the search names.  This is the default.
-no_chase
   displays status information for the intermediate links.  This isthe
   default.
-omit
   suppresses status information for library entries awaiting deletion
   from the libraries.  This is the default.


-library library_name, -lb library_name
   identifies a library that is to be searched for entries matching the
   search names.  The Multics star convention can be used to identify a
   group of libraries with a single library name.  Up to 100 -library
   control arguments can be given in each command.  If none are given,
   then any default library names specified in the library descriptor
   are used.
-retain, -ret
   displays status information for library entries awaiting deletion
   from the libraries (as determined by the library search program).


-search_name search_name
   identifies a search name that begins with a minus (-) to distinguish
   the search name from a control argument.  There are no other
   differences between the search names described above and those given
   with the -search_name control argument.  One or more -search_name
   control arguments can be given in the command.


List of output arguments:
   These arguments control which status information are included in the
   output.  The output arguments can appear anywhere in the command.
-access
   displays all access control information, which includes:  the user's
   access mode to the library entry, its ring brackets, ACL, access
   class, AIM attributes, safety switch setting, and for directory
   entries the initial ACLs.
-all, -a
   displays all available information.
-contents
   displays information describing the contents of library entries,
   which includes:  compilation information, object attributes, and
   segment printability information.


-default, -dft
   displays default information in addition to the information
   requested by other output arguments.  This is the default when no
   other output arguments are given.
-status, -st
   displays all status information printed by the command "status
   -all", except for access control information.


   The following output arguments are available, but are probably not
   of interest to every user.  They provide more selective control over
   which status information is included in the output.
-access_class, -acc
   displays the access class (if other than system low), the setting of
   the security-out-of-service switch, the audit switch, and the
   multiple access class switch (if on).
-acl
   displays the access control list.
-author, -at
   displays the author and bit count author (if different from the
   author).
-bit_count, -bc
   displays the bit count.


-compiler_name
   displays the name of the compiler of an object segment.
-compiler_options
   displays the compiler option information stored in an object
   segment.
-compiler_version
   displays the version information for the compiler of an object
   segment.
-copy, -cp
   displays the setting of the copy-on-write switch (if on).
-current_length
   displays the current length (if different from records used).


-date, -dt
   displays the date/time contents modified, date/time used, date/time
   entry modified, date/time dumped, and date/time compiled.
-date_time_compiled, -dtc
   displays the date/time compiled.
-date_time_contents_modified, -dtcm
   displays the date/time modified.
-date_time_dumped, -dtd
   displays the date/time dumped.
-date_time_entry_modified, -dtem
   displays the date/time entry modified.  For archive components, this
   corresponds to the date/time component updated into the archive.
-date_time_used, -dtu
   displays the date/time used.


-device, -dv
   displays the name of the logical volume on which the entry resides
   for nondirectory and non-MSF entries, the name of the son's logical
   volume for directory and MSF entries, and the setting of the
   transparent-to-paging device switch.
-error
   displays messages that indicate the errors that occurred while
   obtaining the status information.
-initial_acl, -iacl
   displays the initial access control lists associated with library
   directory entries.


-length, -ln
   displays the records used, current length (if different from the
   records used), maximum length (if different from
   sys_info$max_seg_size), bit count, archive component offset, and
   directory quota information.
-level, -lev
   causes a level number to precede each output entry.  This number
   indicates the relationship between a library entry and its
   components.  Normally, this relationship is indicated only by
   indenting the component names beneath those of the library entry.
-link_target
   displays the pathname of the target of each library link.
-match
   displays all names that match any of the search names.


-max_length, -ml
   displays the maximum length (if different from
   sys_info$max_seg_size).
-mode, -md
   displays the user's mode of access to the library entry.
-name, -nm
   displays all names.
-new_line, -nl
   causes a line to be skipped between each level-one entry in the
   output.  Normally, no lines are skipped between entries.
-non_ascii
   displays an indication that a library entry contains non-ASCII
   characters.


-object_info
   displays information about format of an object segment and its entry
   bound.
-offset, -ofs
   displays the word offset of an archive component within its archive.
-pathname, -pn
   displays the pathname of the parent of each library entry.
-primary, -pri
   displays the primary name.


-quota
   displays directory quota information for library directory entries,
   which includes:  quota set on the directory, quota used, terminal
   quota switch setting (if on), a count of inferior directories with
   terminal quota (if nonzero), the time/record product for the
   directory, and the date-time/time-record product updated.  If a
   directory is a master directory, this information is also printed.
-records, -rec
   displays the records used.
-ring_brackets, -rb
   displays the ring brackets.
-safety
   displays the setting of the safety switch (if on).


-type, -tp
   displays the type of each library entry, which includes:  link,
   segment, archive, archive component, multisegment file, multisegment
   file component, and directory.
-unique_id, -uid
   displays the unique identifier.


Notes:  Any combination of output arguments can be used in a command,
since the use of several output arguments merely causes more
information to be included in the output; however, -chase and -no_chase
as well as -retain and -omit are mutually exclusive.

The -container and -components control arguments are provided to
facilitate information gathering on all library entries related to a
given bound segment.  When only one component of a bound segment
archive is matched, -entry causes status information to be printed for
only the matching library entry; -container and -components, which can
be used singly or together but neither with -entry, cause status for
related library entries as well.


The use of -container and -components has different effects.  If a
search name is given that matches a component in a source archive,
giving -entry produces status for only that component.  Giving
-container instead produces status for the source archive, as well as
for the matching component.  Giving -components produces status for all
of the components of the source archive containing the matching
component.  Giving both -container and -components produces status for
the source archive and all of its components.
