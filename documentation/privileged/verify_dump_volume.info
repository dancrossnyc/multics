04/05/85 verify_dump_volume

Syntax as a command:  verify_dump_volume dvname {-control_args}


Function:  checks the validity and readability of a dump volume
produced by the volume dumper subsystem.  Optionally it will also
produce a pathname list of the segments and directories, if known, on
the dump volume.


Arguments:
dvname
   is the name of the dump volume.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   produces a short form list of objects on the dump volume consisting
   only of pathnames.
-input_volume_desc STR
   uses the attach description STR (default attach description is
   tape_mult_ ^a -system).  The volname is inserted at the first
   occurrence of ^a in the attach description.
-long, -lg
   produces a long form list of objects on the dump volume consisting
   of pathname, object type, and other information where applicable.
-stop_vtocx N
   stops the verification process when a VTOCE with octal index N is
   encountered, calls the debug command, and prints a pointer to the
   VTOCE.


Notes:  If no control argument is specified, the entire dump volume is
read and an error count message is printed at the end of the volume.
If read errors occur, the same resynchronization mechanism used by the
volume reloader and volume retriever is used.  If the pathname cannot
be determined, the string "UNKNOWN" is used.
