02/27/85 reconfigure, rcf

Syntax as a command:  rcf operation type name {-control_args}


Function:  adds or deletes selected reconfigurable entities to or from
the current configuration.


Arguments:
operation
   is one of the functions listed below under "List of Operations."
type
   is one of the reconfigurable entities listed below under "List of
   Reconfigurable Entities."
name
   is the name of the item being reconfigured.  Examples of names are
   given under "List of Reconfigurable Entities."


Control arguments:
-add_all_attachments
   used only after an add operation.  This control argument causes all
   reconfigurable entities which are newly accessible to be added.
-brief, -bf
   does not print out a list of every item which is added or removed.
   This is the default.
-delete_all_attachments
   used only after a delete operation.  This control argument causes
   all reconfigurable entities which will become inaccessible to be
   deleted.
-long, -lg
   prints out a list of every item which is added or removed.


List of operations:
add
   the specified item is to be added to the current configuration.  It
   will thus become available for use.
delete, dl
   the specified item is to be deleted from the current configuration.
   It will thus become unavailable for use.


List of reconfigurable entities:
channel, chan, chnl
   a logical channel.  A channel's name is the name by which IOI knows
   it (e.g., a9, b23).
cpu
   a Central Processing Unit.  A processor's name is its tag as it
   appears on a cpu card in the config deck (e.g., a, b).  Only
   processors that are defined in the configuration deck can be added.
   You must set all of the switches correctly and initialize the
   processor before you issue this command.
device, dv, prph
   a peripheral device.  A device's name is the name by which RCP knows
   it (e.g., tapa_03, dskb_13, fnpc, opca).


iom
   an Input/Output Multiplexer.  An IOM's name is its tag as it appears
   on an iom card in the config deck (e.g., a, b).
link_adapter, la
   a link adapter or physical channel.  This is a shorthand way of
   specifying a collection of logical channels.  A link adaptor's name
   is the name of its lowest numbered channel (e.g., b28).
mpc
   a Microporgrammed Peripheral Controller.  This is a shorthand way of
   specifying a collection of link adapters (and thus, a collection of
   logical channels).  An MPC's name is its name as it appears on an
   mpc card in the config deck (e.g., mspa, mtpb).


page
   a page of memory.  A page's name is its number.  Pages are numbered
   starting at 0.  Numbers may be given in any form acceptable to the
   cv_integer_string_ function.  A range of pages may be specified by
   an expression of the form <low>:<high>.  Pages to be added must
   reside within system controllers already in the Multics
   configuration.  Pages to be removed must reside within a single
   system controller.
mem, scu
   a System Control Unit.  An SCU's name is its tag as it appears on a
   mem card in the config deck (e.g., a, b).  Only system controllers
   that are defined in the configuration deck can be added.  You must
   set all of the switches on the system controller correctly before
   you issue this command.


Access required:  Use of the reconfigure command requires re access to
the hphcs_gate.


Notes:  When you add an SCU, all of its pages are also added.  However,
when you delete all of an SCU's pages, the SCU itself is not deleted.

Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, and the Operator's
Guide to Multics, Order No.  GB61.
