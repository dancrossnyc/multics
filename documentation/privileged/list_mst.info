01/13/87  list_mst


Syntax as a command:  list_mst input_spec {names} {-control_args}


Function:  lists segments on a Multics System Tape (MST), or in an MST
image stored in a file.


Arguments:
input_spec
   can be either the -input_volume or -input_file control argument, or
   a reel identification number of the tape to be listed.  The reel
   identification number, which is site dependent, can be up to 32
   characters long.
names
   are names of segments to be listed.  If you give no names, all the
   segments on the tape are listed.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-input_volume volname, -ivol volname
   gives the input tape volume name of the MST to be listed.
-input_file path, -if path
   gives the pathname of a file containing an MST image to be listed.
   This file must have been previously created by generate_mst or
   copy_mst.
-density DEN, -den DEN
   gives a tape density.  DEN may be 800, 1600 or 6250.  The input tape
   is mounted on a tape drive capable of reading density DEN.  However,
   the actual density at which the input tape is written determines the
   density used for reading.  The default density is 1600 BPI (bits per
   inch).


Notes:  A summary line, giving the length of each segment and its
primary name, is printed out for each segment listed.  A special name
is printed out for segments written with the first_name keyword of the
generate_mst command because the proper name of such segments does not
appear on the tape.  A diagnostic is issued if you provide names that
match no segments on the tape.
