Syntax as a command:  retrieve path {-control_args}


Function:  retrieves specified storage system segments, directories and
subtrees.  It does this by copying them from a hierarchy dump tape into
the hierarchy, possibly into different places in the hierarchy than
those from which they were originally dumped.  The retireve command
calls the backup_load command to do the actual retrieving.

The retrieve command requires a retrieval control file, containing the
pathnames of the objects to be retrieved.  It calls backup_load once
for each line in the control file.  See "Notes on Format of a Retrieval
Control File" below.  Cross retrievals are allowed; i.e., objects can
be retrieved into different places in the hierarchy than those
specified on the dump tape.  The retrieve command places its maps in
the working directory and doesn't automatically dprint them.  Quota on
the retrieved directories is not force-set.


The retrieve command is one of the commands used for hierarchy
reloading and retrieving of storage system segments and directories.
The other commands are:

   backup_load
   reload (initializer command)
   reload (Multics command)
   reload_system_release


You should note that argument processing for all of the hierarchy
backup commands is performed by a common argument processing procedure.
The values of all arguments are remembered in static storage and remain
in effect for the life of the process, unless changed by arguments
given in subsequent invocations of backup commands.  It should also be
noted that the dumping commands and the reloading/retrieving commands
are all part of the same hierarchy backup system, and argument values
set by the dumping commands remain in effect for the
reloading/retrieving commands and vice versa, unless overridden.
However, dumping and reloading cannot be done in the same process; use
the new_proc command between dumping and reloading.  See "Notes on
Default Arguments" below.


Arguments:
path
   is the absolute pathname of a retrieval control file (see "Notes on
   Format of a Retrieval Control File" below).  This argument is
   required.  It can be given anywhere on the command line.


Control arguments:
-all
   causes segments to be retrieved from the tape regardless of their
   date/time dumped.  This is the default.  This control argument
   overrides a previously given DATE argument.
-brief_map, -bfmap
   creates a map file that lists the processed entires.
-control path
   indicates that path is a hierarchy retrieval control file pathname.
   See "Notes on Format of a Retrieval Control File" below.


-debug
   disables those hphcs_ calls that set quotas and transparency
   switches.
-destination STR, -ds STR
   specifies a destination for printing maps and error file.  The
   default is "incremental" for maps and "error file" for error files.
-error_of
   writes error messages into a file rather than printing them.  The
   name of the error file is printed when the first error is
   encountered.  This is the default.
-error_on
   writes error messages on the user's terminal.
-first
   prevents searching a tape for additional copies of a requested
   segment or subtree after the first copy has been retrieved.


-header STR, -he STR
   specifies a heading for printing maps and error files.
-last
   indicates that the last copy of a given segment or subtree on a tape
   or set of tapes is to be retrieved.  This is the default.
-map
   writes a list of the segments and directories processed into a file.
   This is the default.
-nodebug
   enables hphcs_ calls to set quotas and the transparency switches.
   This is the default.


-nomap
   inhibits listing of the names of processed segments and directories.
-noprimary, -npri
   uses each pathname as given.  The default is -primary.
-noqcheck
   causes the hierarchy reload to be done with quota checking
   suspended.  Access to hphcs_ is required.  This is the default.
-noquota
   inhibits resetting of quotas.  See -quota.  This is the default.
-noreload
   inhibits actual hierarchy reloading of segments into the hierarchy.
   This control argument can be used with -map to create a table of
   contents of the tape.  The -noreload control argument also causes
   the names that would have been reloaded to be put into the map.


-nosetlvid
   inhibits the setting of the logical volume identifiers for each
   directory to be reloaded.
-notrim
   inhibits deletion of entries in a directory.  Entries can only be
   added or modified.  This is the default.
-operator STR
   indicates that STR is the user's name or initials (up to 16
   characters in length).
-primary, -pri
   replaces all directory names in each pathname with the primary
   names.  This is the default.
-pvname STR
   indicates that segments and directories can only be retrieved onto
   the physical volume specified by STR.


-qcheck
   causes quota restrictions to be enforced during the reload.
-quota
   causes the quotas on directories being reloaded to be set to the
   values they had when the directories were dumped.  Access to hphcs_
   is required.
-reload
   enables actual reloading of segments into the hierarchy.  This is
   the default.
-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   specifies an output request type for printing maps and error files.
   Available request types can be listed by using the
   print_request_types command (described in the Multics Commands and
   Active Functions manual, Order No.  AG92 ).  The default is
   "printer".


-setlvid
   enables setting of the logical volume identifier for reloaded
   entries inferior to each directory reloaded.  This is the default.
-trim
   enables deletion of all entries in a directory not found in the copy
   of that directory being reloaded.  This causes entries deleted from
   an earlier version of the directory to be deleted when a later
   version is reloaded.  It has effect only in the case of a directory
   that is both on the tape and in the hierarchy.  This is the default.
DATE
   an argument beginning with a character other than "-", or ">" is
   assumed to be a date in a format acceptable to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If it can be converted
   successfully, then the hierarchy retriever only retrieves segments
   and directories dumped at or after the given date/time.


Notes on default arguments:  The values of arguments given to any of
the hierarchy backup commands are remembered in static storage and
remain in effect for the life of the process, unless explicitly changed
during the invocation of a subsequent backup command.

The following defaults are in effect for the reloader and retriever
before any backup commands are given; they are not, however, reset to
these values at the start of each backup command, except as noted
below.

      -all		-noquota
      -error_of		-primary
      -map		-reload
      -nodebug		-setlvid
      -nohold		-trim


The following defaults are set automatically at the time the respective
commands are executed:

      reload (initializer command), reload (Multics command),
         reload_system_release:
         -quota
         -trim

      retrieve:
         -all
         -noquota
         -notrim

      All of the above commands:
         -map


Notes on format of a retrieval control file:  The hierarchy retrieval
is controlled by an ASCII segment containing one line for each object
to be retrieved.  A line can contain a single pathname or two pathnames
separated by an equal sign.  The left-hand side specifies the segment
or directory sought and the right-hand side, if present, specifies the
new name under which that entity is to be retrieved.  The sought
pathname must begin with a > and end with either an entryname or the
characters >**.  If an entryname is specified, a single object of that
name is retrieved.


If >** is specified, the entire directory hierarchy, beginning at the
point indicated in the pathname, is retrieved.  In this case, the
right_hand pathname, if present, ends in the name of the directory
under which these entries are to be reloaded.  For example:

      >udd>one_dir>**=>udd>two_dir

If a new name is specified on the right, it can be either a pathname or
an entryname.  If an entryname is given, the single object found is
loaded with its former pathname and the new entryname.


If two pathnames are specified, both are checked against the current
hierarchy and a new pathname consisting only of the primary entryname
is created.  This new pathname, as well as the original, is then used
in searching the hierarchy.  For example, >udd>sd is translated into
>user_dir_dir>SysDaemon and both versions are sought.  Primary names
are used unless the -noprimary control argument is in effect.

A hierarchy retrieval control file can contain a maximum of 256 lines.
