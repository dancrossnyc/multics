04/04/85 delete_volume_log

Syntax as a command:  delete_volume_log vlname {-control_arg}


Function:  deletes the volume log segment used by the volume backup
subsystem in a way that keeps the other segments used by the volume
backup subsystem consistent.


Arguments:
vlname
   is the name of the volume log.  The volog suffix is assumed if not
   specified.


Control arguments:
-manual_free
   specifies that if deleting is done, volumes are not freed from the
   volume pool automatically; manual freeing is required.  This means
   that dump volumes are deleted from the respective volume logs but
   are not reused until they are marked as free in the volume pool.
   The default is to automatically free volumes in the volume pool.


Notes:  This command should only be used to delete volume log segments
of physical volumes for which neither retrieval nor reloading is
intended in the future.
