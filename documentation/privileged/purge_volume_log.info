10/3/89  purge_volume_log

Syntax as a command:  purge_volume_log vlname {-control_args}


Function:  removes, in a consistent manner, those entries in a volume
log that represent out-of-date information.  Each entry in a volume log
is part of a reload group.  A reload group consists of a set of dump
volumes that would be used during a reload of the physical volume.


Arguments:
vlname
   is the name of the volume log.  The volog suffix is assumed if not
   specified.


Control arguments:
-auto
   if specified, the volumes purged are freed in the default dump
   volume pool, which is also known as the tape pool or the volume pool
   segment, and is located at >ddd>volume_backup>Volume_Dumper.volumes.
   For more information, see the description of the manage_volume_pool
   command in the Multics Commands and Active Functions manual, Order
   No.  AG92.  The default is off.
-force
   if specified, causes purging even when some required databases
   cannot be located.


-test
   runs in test mode and reports what would have been done.  No
   databases are affected except for pvolog locks which are reset.
-working_dir, -wd
   specifies that the volume logs are in the working directory, and the
   physical volume logs searched for in the [wd]>pvolog directory.  The
   default is to search relative to the >ddd>volume_backup directory.


Notes: After purging, two reload groups are left in a volume log unless
the number of reload groups has been changed (see the set_volume_log
command).  A reload group consists of the following: all incremental
volume dumps not superseded by consolidated volume dumps; all
incremental and consolidated volume dumps not superseded by a complete
volume dump; a complete volume dump.  By default all consolidated dumps
and those incremental dumps which are not superseded by a complete
dump are retained.  To modify the number of incremental and
consolidated dump sets retained see the -incr_sets and -cons_sets
control argument of the set_volume_log command.
