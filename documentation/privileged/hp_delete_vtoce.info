02/08/85 hp_delete_vtoce

Syntax as a command:  hp_delete_vtoce pvname vtoc_index {-control_args}


Function:  deletes a specified Volume Table of Contents Entry (VTOCE).
You can use it when cleaning up after a sweep_pv to get rid of orphans,
or whenever you want a forward connection failure.


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the physical volume on which the VTOCE to be expunged
   exists.
vtoc_index
   is the index (in octal) of the VTOCE to be expunged.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message announcing the deletion of the VTOCE, which
   is only printed if no questions are asked.
-clear
   uses the privileged entry that sets an entire VTOCE to zero, rather
   than deleting it.  Give -clear only when a VTOCE contains invalid
   information that may cause problems (reused addresses, crashes,
   etc.)  if you delete it as usual, since it leaves the volume on
   which the VTOCE existed in an inconsistent state.  Salvage such
   volume with the volume salvager after you have deleted all the
   seriously inconsistent VTOCEs.  Don't use this control argument to
   delete a reverse connection failure VTOCE (an ordinary orphan).


-force, -fc
   forces the deletion of the VTOCE if it is an orphan, with no
   intervening questions; if it is not, you must supply also -no_check
   to suppress all questions.
-no_check, -nch
   suppresses the check made to see whether or not the VTOCE is an
   orphan; if it is not, deleting it causes a forward connection
   failure in its parent directory.
-query, -qy
   always queries whether or not to delete the VTOCE, even if it is an
   orphan.


Access required:  You require access to the phcs_ and hphcs_ gates.


Notes:  You cannot use this command to delete the VTOCE of an active
segment.  The default is to check whether the VTOCE is an orphan, and
delete it if it is, or ask whether to delete it if is not.
