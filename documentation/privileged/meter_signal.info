Syntax as a command:  meter_signal {-control_args}


Function:  measures the performance of the Multics signalling
mechanism.  It sets up an environment of condition handlers and stack
frames, and then causes a specified number of zerodivide faults to
occur.  The calendar clock is read before each fault and again as the
first operation in the zerodivide condition handler.  The difference
between these values is recorded and printed on the terminal.  The mean
and minimum values for all zerodivide faults caused in an invocation
are computed.


Control arguments:
Each control argument must include a decimal value (N) and can be
specified in any order.
-nfaults N
   specifies how many zerodivide faults to cause.  One zerodivide fault
   is the default.
-nframes N
   specifies the number of stack frames to be established between the
   frame containing the zerodivide handler and the frame that causes
   the fault.  The fault occurs in the same frame that established the
   handler if the value is one; this is the default.


-nhandlers N
   specifies the number of handlers for dummy conditions to be
   established in each stack frame.  Handlers are established for the
   conditions meter_signal1 through meter_signalN where N is the value
   specified.  The default is that no dummy interrupt handler is
   established.
-unclaimed N
   specifies that an unclaimed_signal handler should be established
   instead of the zerodivide handler.  The unclaimed_signal handler is
   established in the Nth frame where N is the value specified.  Stack
   frames are numbered from 1 to p, where p is the number in the
   -nframe control argument.  The default is that no unclaimed_signal
   handler is established.
