11/09/89  set_volume_log

Syntax as a command:  set_volume_log VLNAME {-control_arg}


Function: alters certain parameters that describe the contents of a
volume log.


Arguments:
VLNAME
   is the name of the volume log.  The volog suffix is assumed if not
   specified.


Control arguments:
-cons_sets SET_VALUE, -cs SET_VALUE
   Sets the number of consolidated dump volume sets to retain in the
   volume log whenever it is purged.  The value of SET_VALUE may be a
   non-zero positive integer or the word "all" or the letter "a".  A
   consolidated dump set is defined as all volumes that are used in
   one cycle of the consolidated volume dumper.  By default all
   consolidated dump volumes are kept for each reload group.  The
   default operation will result if the SET_VALUE is set to "all" or
   "a".  See "Notes" section for further explanation of the rules
   on how volume sets are retained or purged.


-incr_sets SET_VALUE, -is SET_VALUE
   sets the number of incremental dump volume sets to retain in the
   volume log whenever it is purged.  The value of SET_VALUE may be a
   non-zero positive integer or the word "all" or the letter "a".  An
   incremental dump set is defined as all volumes that are used in all
   cycles of the incremental volume dumper that take place between
   cycles of the consolidated volume dumper.  By default all
   incremental dump volumes are kept for each reload group.  The
   default operation will result if the SET_VALUE is set to "all" or
   "a".  See "Notes" section for further explaination of the rules
   on how volume sets are retained or purged.

-reload_groups N, -rg N
   sets the number of reload groups to N, where N>1.  The default
   value, set at volume log creation, is 2.


Notes:

   1) All incremental volume sets are retained by default and are
      purged when the reload group they are in is purged.  This
      default operation is set up when the volume log is created.
      This default operation can also be set with the following
      command line;

      set_volume_log VLNAME -is all -cs all -reload_groups 2

      When the incr_sets value is a non-zero positive integer, then
      that number of incremental volume sets are retained.  All other
      incremental volume sets are purged, even if they are in the
      current reload group.


   2) All consolidated volume sets are retained by default and are
      purged when the reload group they are in is purged.  This
      default operation is set up when the volume log is created and
      can also be set up with the following command line;

      set_volume_log VLNAME -is all -cs all -reload_groups 2

      No consolidated volume sets are purged in the current reload
      group.  Using the number of consolidated dump sets in all the
      reload groups, consolidated volume sets are purged from previous
      reload groups to satisfy the value given with the -cons_sets
      option if this value is a non-zero positive integer.


   3) No incremental or consolidated volume set is retained if it
      exists outside of the configured number of reload groups.  If it
      is desired to keep more consolidated or incremental volumes
      sets, the number of reload groups must be increased.


Examples:

1. set_volume_log VLNAME -is 1 -cs 5 -reload_groups 8

This will be the result on the Wednesday before the consolidated dump
of the eighth week assuming you are running less incremental runs than
consolidated runs, consolidated runs are done once per day (M-F), and a
complete is run on Saturday.

2. set_volume_log VLNAME -incr_sets 5 -cons_sets 10 -reload_groups 8

This will be the result on the Wednesday before the consolidated dump
of the eighth week assuming you are running less incremental runs than
consolidated runs, consolidated runs are done once per day (M-F), and a
complete is run on Saturday.

3. set_volume_log VLNAME -incr_sets 2 -cons_sets 10 -reload_groups 2

This will be the result on the Wednesday before the consolidated dump
of the second week.  The consolidated runs are done once per day (M-F)
and a complete is run on Saturday.

       |------incr------||incr||incr...
                   |cons||cons|

Notice that there are only 7 consolidated volume sets at this point in
the week.  This is restricted by the number of reload groups
specified, ie, 2.  If a full set of 10 consolidated dumps were desired
at all times, then 3 reload groups must be configured as in the
following example.


4. set_volume_log VLNAME -incr_sets 2 -cons_sets 10 -reload_groups 3

This will be the result on the Wednesday before the consolidated dump
of the second week.  Again, consolidated runs are done once per day
(M-F) and a complete is run on Saturday.
