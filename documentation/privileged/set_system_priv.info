Function:  is used to turn on and off the system privileges that allow
the process to function outside the restrictions of the AIM access

carefully check to ensure that his actions do not accidentally disclose
information that was previously protected by the AIM access controls.

The set_system_priv command is needed only if the site is using the AIM
access controls.
