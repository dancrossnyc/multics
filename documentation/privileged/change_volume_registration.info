03/28/86  change_volume_registration, cvr

Syntax as a command:  cvr -control_args


Function: changes the registration information for a physical or
logical volume.


Control arguments: The -pv or the -lv control argument is required and
   must immediately follow the command name.

   The following control arguments change the registration of a
   physical volume.  They are recognized only when the first control
   argument is -pv.
-date_registered DT_STR, -date DT_STR
   specifies the date the physical volume was registered on.  Normally
   this is generated by the software automatically.  Use -date only in
   correcting registration data after a system failure.


-device_model N, -model N
   specifies the Honeywell model number for the disk device.  Use
   -model only in correcting registration information before volume
   initialization or after a system failure.  Inconsistancies between
   medium label information and the registered information will cause
   difficulties in volume mounting.  The following values are valid for
   N:
      VALUE     DEVICE
      400       MSU0400
      402       MSU0402
      451       MSU0451
      500       MSU0500
      501       MSU0501


-location STR, -loc STR
   specifies the current location of the disk pack.  This is for
   administrative information only.  STR can be any 32 characters
   (e.g., "offline--in cabinet 13").
-manufacturer_serial STR, -serial STR
   specifies the serial number of the physical medium.  This is for
   administrative information only.  STR can be any 32 characters
   (e.g., "Memorex--M234634").
-name PV_NAME, -nm PV_NAME
   specifies that the name of the physical volume is to be changed.
   Use -nm only in correcting registration information before volume
   initialization or after a system failure.  Inconsistancies between
   medium label information and the registered information will cause
   difficulties in volume mounting.


-physical_volume PV_NAME, -pv PV_NAME
   specifies the name of the physical volume for which the registration
   data is to be changed.  (Required, if physical volume registration
   changes are desired)
-physical_volume_uid UID, -pvid UID
   specifies the new unique ID of the physical volume.  A UID is a
   string of 1 to 12 octal digits.  Use -pvid only in correcting
   registration information before volume initialization or after a
   system failure.  Inconsistancies between medium label information
   and the registered information will cause difficulties in volume
   mounting.


   The following control arguments change the registration of a logical
   volume and are recognized only when the first control_arg is -lv.
-access_class MIN_AUTH{:MAX_AUTH}
   specifies the AIM authorization of users allowed to attach the
   volume.  You can specify the authorization by a minimum and a
   maximum authorization value, in which case users at any
   authorization in the range are allowed to attach the volume.
   Alternatively, you can specify the authorization as a single value,
   in which case only users at the specified authorization are allowed
   to use the volume.  You must specify the authorization values using
   valid site-defined authorization strings (see the print_auth_names
   command).  Use -access_class only in correcting registration
   information before volume initialization or after a system failure.
   Inconsistancies between medium label information and the registered
   information will cause difficulties in volume mounting.


-acs_path PATH, -acs PATH
   specifies the pathname of the access control segment (ACS) for the
   volume.  The ACS itself is not created, but must be created at the
   specified path and the desired access control list set (see "Notes"
   below).  The name of the entry must be {lv_name}.acs.  If you give
   no -acs when registering a public volume, only the volume owner will
   have executive privileges (everyone will have read/write privileges,
   given proper access to the hierarchy).  If you give no -acs when
   registering a nonpublic (i.e., a private) volume, the default ACS
   pathname will be >udd>{owner's Project_id}>{owner's
   Person_id}>{lv_name}.acs>.
-logical_volume LVNAME, -lv LV_NAME
   specifies the name of the logical volume for which the registration
   data is to be changed.  (Required, if logical volume registration
   changes are desired)


-logical_volume_uid UID, -lvid UID
   specifies the new unique ID of the logical volume.  A UID is a
   string of 1 to 12 octal digits.  Use -lvid only in correcting
   registration information before volume initialization or after a
   system failure.  Inconsistancies between medium label information
   and the registered information will cause difficulties in volume
   mounting.
-name LV_NAME, -nm LV_NAME
   specifies that the name of the logical volume is to be changed.  Use
   -nm only in correcting registration information before volume
   initialization or after a system failure.  Inconsistancies between
   medium label information and the registered information will cause
   difficulties in volume mounting.


-owner USER_ID, -ow USER_ID
   specifies the user who is to act as the primary volume
   administrator.  This user has the privilege of granting executive
   access to other users via the ACS, granting read/write access to
   others via the ACS (for private volumes), and for setting up volume
   quota accounts.  You can give the Person_id or Project_id as "*".
-public STR
   specifies whether the new logial volume is to be private or public.
   The value of STR can be yes (public) or no (private).  Use -public
   only in correcting registration information before volume
   initialization or after a system failure.  Inconsistancies between
   medium label information and the registered information will cause
   difficulties in volume mounting.


Notes: Physical volume names are restricted to lowercase letters,
digits, and the underscore (_).

If you give any of the following control arguments, you are queried to
determine if the changes are intentional.  This is to avoid problems in
volume mounting due to errors in the registration.
   -access_class
   -device_model
   -logical_volume_uid
   -name
   -physical_volume_uid


Note that you should use these control arguments only to correct the
volume registration data before the volume in question is actually
initialized or after system failure.  The medium label information is
not changed.  Inconsistancies between the label and registration data
will cause difficulties in mounting the volume.


Access required: You need re access to the mdc_rpiv_ gate and s to
-lv.  If any name or UID is to be changed, sm is required to >lv.
