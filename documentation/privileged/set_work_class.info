02/27/85  set_work_class, swc

Syntax as a command:  swc wc_number {id}


Function:  moves a process or set of processes from one work class to
another without installing a revised master group table (MGT).  The
effect of this command is temporary since the answering service
recomputes and resets a process' work class if the shift changes, a new
MGT is installed, the user issues a new_proc command, or the operator
issues the "maxu auto" command.


Arguments:
wc_number
   is the number of the work class to which processes are to be moved.
id
   may be a User_id or a process identifier.  If a User_id is given it
   must be of the form Person.Project.tag, and any or all components
   may be "*".  If a process identifier is given it must be an octal
   number.  If this argument is not given, only the process executing
   the command is moved to the specified work class.


Access required:  This command requires access to hphcs_.
Additionally, this command requires read access to one or more system
tables if the person_id.project_id.tag option is used.  If the tag
specified is "a" or "*", access to the answer_table is required.  If
the tag specified is "m" or "*", access to the absentee_user_table is
required.  If the tag specified is "z" or "*", access to the
daemon_user_table is required.  All of these tables are located in the
directory >system_control_1.


Notes:  In order to prevent severe errors, set_work_class never matches
any User_id to the Initializer process.  If for some reason it is
necessary to move the Initializer out of work class zero, this must be
done by specifying the Initializer's process identifier.
