Syntax as a command:  send_wakeup process_id event_channel
   {event_message}


Function:  sends an IPC wakeup to a process.  It is a command interface
to the hcs_$wakeup subroutine entry point.


Arguments:
process_id
   is a 12-digit octal number specifying the ID of the process that is
   to receive the wakeup.  Leading zeros can be omitted.
event_channel
   is a 24-digit octal number specifying the event channel over which
   the wakeup is to be sent.  Leading zeros can be omitted.
event_message
   is an optional 72-bit event message, given as either a 24-digit
   octal number or an eight-character ASCII string.  The default is all
   zero bits.  Leading zeros or trailing blanks can be omitted.  The
   event message is assumed to be in octal form if it contains only
   octal digits.


Notes:  Nonexistent processes and event channels of invalid format are
diagnosed; however, validly formed but nonexistent event channels are
not diagnosed.

The process_id active function is a convenient way of obtaining a
process id, given a User_id or channel name.
