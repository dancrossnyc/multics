02/28/85 sweep

Syntax as a command:  sweep {path} {-control_args}


Function:  obtains the disk usage figures for the hierarchy, or any
specified subtree, and places them in a segment for subsequent use by
accounting and disk usage analysis tools.  By default, the segment is
named disk_stat.  It is not an ASCII segment, and the disk_stat_print
command must be used to print its contents.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory at which the sweep is to start.
   The usage figures for this directory, and for the entire subtree
   beneath it are recorded.  If path is omitted, the sweep begins at
   the root directory.  See "Notes" below.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   does not print an error message when unable to force access to a
   directory to read its usage figures.  This is the default.
-long, -lg
   prints an error message if unable to force access to a directory.
-output_file XX, -of XX
   places the output in the specified segment XX rather than in the
   default segment, named disk_stat, in the working directory.


-pdd
   do not exlude >pdd from the sweep.  By default, a sweep that starts
   at the root deliberately omits >pdd.  This argument is not used in
   the accounting application of this program, but it may be used
   during an analysis of disk space usage, when complete and accurate
   total page usage figures are desired.  The initializer process must
   first be used to give sma access to >pdd to the process that will
   run the sweep.


Notes:  The figures recorded in disk_stat are the quota, records used,
and time-record product (trp).  These figures are recorded separately
for segment pages and directory pages.

Since directories with zero quotas have their record usage and trp
figures included in those of the first superior directory with nonzero
quota, it is not necessary for sweep to walk the entire hierarchy.
Instead, whenever it encounters a directory with a zero quota, it goes
no further down in that particular branch, but instead goes on to the
next directory at the same level.  This applies separately to segment
and directory quotas.


Therefore, any directory whose usage figures are to be recorded
separately for purposes of accounting or disk usage analysis must be
given nonzero segment and directory quotas.  It is recommended that at
least all directories immediately inferior to the root and all project
directories under >udd be given nonzero segment and directory quotas.

Project administrators may use this command to obtain detailed
information about the disk usage of a project's users by executing
sweep with the project directory pathname as the first argument.  This
is possible, however, only if the users' home directories have nonzero
quotas.
