02/27/85 reset_disk_meters

Syntax as a command:  reset_disk_meters {path} {-control_arg}


Function:  subtracts the time-page-product (tpp) for each directory in
the Multics hierarchy listed in disk_stat from the tpp integrator of
the directory itself.  This operation is done once each month after
users have been billed for disk usage.  Privileged entry points in the
hphcs_ gate are used to do the work.  A comment is printed if the
branch does not exist or a negative tpp would result, but the program
continues.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the disk_stat segment containing the usage values
   to be subtracted from the tpp integrators.  The default is the
   segment disk_stat in the working directory.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the user is not to be informed when it is necessary
   to force access to a directory to reset its tpp.


Notes:  This command forces access to directories, if necessary, and
removes the access when finished.  It reports when it must do this,
unless the -brief control argument is given, and it always reports if
unable to force access.

After resetting all of the tpps, it zeros the per-project disk usage
figures in the segment projfile, in the working directory.  (This
segment is an implicit input to the command.)

If the system crashes while this command is running, the command can be
restarted from the beginning.
