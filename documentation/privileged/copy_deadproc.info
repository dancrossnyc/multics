Syntax:  copy_deadproc {deadproc_name} {-ctls_args}


Function:   This  tool  sets  up  a  dead  process  directory  in
preparation for use by analyze_multics.  It copies a dead process
directory specified by deadproc_name into the directory under the
>dumps>save_pdirs directory.  Several hardcore segments needed by
analyze_multics are also copied into the directory.  Two segments
are   created   by   the   copy_deadproc   tool,   pdir_info  and
uid_hash_table.  These are used by analyze_multics when examining
a  dead  process.  Any target segments pointed to by links in the
process directory are also copied.  The  dead  process  directory
is  renamed to person.pdir where "pdir" is  the standard  suffix.
If person.pdir already exists, it  is renamed  before copying the
new  directory  to  person.N.pdir,  where  N=1.  If person.1.pdir
already exists, it  is  renamed  to  person.N+1.pdir,  and so on.
Access to the new pdir is determined  by the  initial dir_acl  of
the save_pdirs directory.


Arguments:

deadproc_name
   is the  name of the  dead process directory to  be copied.  If
   deadproc_name is not an absolute pathname, the default path is
   >process_dir_dir>deadproc_name.   The  names  of  dead process
   directories   in   the  >process_dir_dir   are  of   the  form
   person.project.f.tty_name.   A name  of this  form is expected
   and the full name must be specified.


Control arguments:

-delete, -dl
   specifies that after the dead  process is copied, the original
   one  is  to  be  deleted.  Status  and  modify  access  to the
   containing  directory is  needed.  If  access is  lacking, the
   user is queried about whether to continue copying.

-name deadproc_name, -nm deadproc_name
   specifies the name of the process to be copied.

-no_delete, -ndl
   specifies  do  not  delete  the dead  process  directory after
   copying is complete.  This is the default.

-owner, -ow
   specifies that access be set appropriately for the user of the
   fatal process.  This is status on the dead process directory.


Notes:  The use of this command requires access to phcs_.  A user
can  copy  his own  process  if he  has  "sma" on  the save_pdirs
directory  and access  to phcs_.   Access to  the hphcs_  gate is
needed if  the dead process  doesn't belong to  the process doing
the copying.  Access to the system_privilege_gate_ is needed when
copying terminated  processes of a  different authorization level
than the process doing the copying.
