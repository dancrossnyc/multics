Notes:  All entries are displayed if no selection arguments are given.

The -user and -owner GROUP_ID operand is given in one of the following
formats:

          person_id.project_id.tag
          person_id.project_id
          person_id

where any of the components can be omitted or given as an asterisk (*)
to match all values in that component position.
