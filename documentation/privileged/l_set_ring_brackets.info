03/31/83  l_set_ring_brackets, lsrb

Syntax:  lsrb {path} {optional_args}


Function:  This command modifies the ring brackets of any segment,
including segments whose ring brackets are 1,1,1.  This command
operates on objects whose ring brackets prevent them from being
operated on by the set_ring_brackets command.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of a segment whose ring
   brackets are to be modified.
optional_args
  rb1
     is the number to be used as the first ring bracket of the segment.
     (See "Notes" below.)
  rb2
     is the number to be used as the second ring bracket of the
     segment.  (See "Notes" below.)
  rb3
     is the number to be used as the third ring bracket of the segment.
     (See "Notes" below.)


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_ gate is required.

If rb3 is omitted, the third ring bracket is set to rb2.  If rb2
and rb3 are omitted, the ring brackets are set to rb1.  If rb1, rb2,
and rb3 are omitted, they are set to the user's current validation
level.  The ring brackets must be in the allowable range 1 through 7
and must have the ordering:

     rb1 _ rb2 _ rb3
