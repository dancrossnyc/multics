03/31/86  add_volume_registration, avr

Syntax as a command:  avr -control_args


Function: registers a new physical volume.  If the specified logical
volume does not exist, it will be registered as well.


Control arguments: The following control arguments pertain to the
   registration of a physical volume.
-device_model N, -model N
   specifies the Honeywell model number for the disk device.
   (Required.)  The following values are valid for N:
      VALUE     DEVICE
      400       MSU0400
      402       MSU0402
      451       MSU0451
      500       MSU0500
      501       MSU0501


-location STR, -loc STR
   specifies the current location of the disk pack.  This is for
   administrative information only.  STR can be any 32 characters
   (e.g., "offline--in cabinet 13").  (Default: "uninitialized")
-logical_volume LVNAME, -lv LV_NAME
   specifies the logical volume name.  If the specified logical volume
   is not already registered on the system, you are queried if the new
   logical volume should be registered.  (Required)
-manufacturer_serial STR, -serial STR
   specifies the serial number of the physical medium.  This for
   administrative information only.  STR can be any 32 characters
   (e.g., "Memorex--M234634").  (Default: "unspecified")


-physical_volume PV_NAME, -pv PV_NAME
   specifies the name of the physical volume to be registered.
   (Required; must immediately follow the command name)
-physical_volume_uid UID, -pvid UID
   specifies the unique ID of the physical volume to be registered.  A
   UID is a string of 1 to 12 octal digits.  Normally, a UID is
   generated automatically.  Use -pvid only when recreating a
   registration after system failure.


   The following control arguments are allowed only when registering a
   new logical volume.
-access_class MIN_AUTH{:MAX_AUTH}
   specifies the AIM authorization of users allowed to attach the
   volume.  You can specify the authorization by a minimum and a
   maximum authorization value, in which case users at any
   authorization in the range are allowed to attach the volume.
   Alternatively, you can specify the authorization as a single value,
   in which case only users at the specified authorization are allowed
   to use the volume.  You must specify the authorization values using
   valid site-defined authorization strings (see the print_auth_names
   command).


-acs_path PATH, -acs PATH
   specifies the pathname of the access control segment (ACS) for the
   volume.  The ACS itself is not created, but must be created at the
   specified path and the desired access control list set (see "Notes"
   below).  The name of the entry must be {lv_name}.acs.  If you give
   no -acs when registering a public volume, only the volume owner will
   have executive privileges (everyone will have read/write privileges,
   given proper access to the hierarchy).  If you give no -acs when
   registering a nonpublic (i.e., a private) volume, the default ACS
   pathname will be >udd>{owner's Project_id}>{owner's
   Person_id}>{lv_name}.acs>.


-logical_volume_uid UID, -lvid UID
   specifies the unique ID of the logical volume being registered.  A
   UID is a string of 1 to 12 octal digits.  Normally, the software
   automatically generates this ID.  Use -lvid only when recreating a
   registration after a system failure.
-owner USER_ID, -ow USER_ID
   specifies the user who is to act as the primary volume
   administrator.  This user has the privilege of granting executive
   access to other users via the ACS, granting read/write access to
   others via the ACS (for private volumes), and for setting up volume
   quota accounts.  You can give the Person_id or Project_id as "*".
   (Default: to use the user's Person_id and Project_id)
-public STR
   specifies whether the new logical volume is to be private or public.
   STR can be yes (public) or no (private).  (Default: yes)


Notes: Physical volume names are restricted to lowercase letters,
digits, and the underscore (_).

If the logical volume does not exist, you will be queried whether the
volume should be registered as a new logical volume.

Private volumes must be explicitly attached to a process for access via
the attach_lv command.  You must have rw access to the ACS for private
volumes.  In either case, you must have proper hierarchy access before
segments may be read or written.

Public volumes do not require attachment to the user's process; thus,
all users have read/write access to public volumes (provided there is
proper hierarchy access).


Access required: You require to have re access to the mdc_priv_ gate
and sma to >lv to register new logical volumes or sm to >lv to register
new physical volumes.
