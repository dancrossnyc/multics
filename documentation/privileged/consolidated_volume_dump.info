10/3/89  consolidated_volume_dump

Syntax as a command:  consolidated_volume_dump -control_args


Function:  starts a consolidated volume dump.  For each physical volume
specified, those segments and directories that have been incrementally
dumped since the last consolidated volume dump are dumped.  This
command frees for use the incremental tapes that it makes obsolete,
consistent with the -incr_skip_count control argument.


Control arguments:
-accounting
   specifies that accounting data is to be collected in the directory
   >sc1>volume_backup_accounts for later processing.  The default is
   off.  This control argument is optional.
-auto
   specifies that dump volumes are to be selected from the default dump
   volume pool, which is also known as the tape pool or the volume pool
   segment, and is located at >ddd>volume_backup>Volume_Dumper.volumes.
   For more information, see the description of the manage_volume_pool
   command in the Multics Commands and Active Functions manual, Order
   No.  AG92.  This control argument is optional.


-control entry
   where entry is the entryname of the control segment.  The suffix
   "dump" is assumed if not specified.  This control argument is
   required.
-cumulative
   specifies that segments and directories dumped are not to be removed
   from the list of objects to be dumped next time.  This provides
   cumulative dumping if desired.  The default is off.  This control
   argument is optional.
-error_on
   specifies that all error messages are to be written to the
   error_output switch as well as to the dmpr_err.mm/dd/yy.hhmm.s
   segment.  The default is that error messages are written only to the
   dmpr_err.mm/dd/yy.hhmm.s segment.  This control argument is
   optional.


-manual_free
   specifies that if purging is done, volumes must be freed from the
   volume pool manually.  This means that dump volumes are purged from
   the respective volume logs but are not reused until they are marked
   as free in the volume pool.  The default is to automatically free
   volumes in the volume pool.  This control argument should be used
   only with the -auto control argument.


-names
   specifies that the entire name space of each directory dumped will
   be recorded online.  This online data base significantly improves
   the performance of the volume retriever, but requires a large amount
   of disk storage.  This control argument is optional.
-no_object
   specifies that segments and directories are not to be dumped.  Only
   the header information that describes them is dumped.  The default
   is to dump the segments and directories.  This control argument is
   optional.
-no_purge_volume_log, -npvl
   specifies that the volume log of each physical volume dumped is NOT
   to be purged using the values set with the set_volume_log command.
   (Default).


-no_trace
   specifies that the dumping process is not be be traced.  This is the
   default.
-no_update
   specifies that the VTOCE of segments and directories dumped is not
   to be updated.  This speeds up dumping at the cost of invalidating
   the dtd and volume id fields of the VTOCE.  The default is to update
   the VTOCE.  This control argument is optional.
-operator STR
   where STR specifies the name or initials of the user.  This control
   argument is required.


-output_volume_desc STR
   where STR specifies a value to be used instead of the default attach
   description.  The dump volume name is inserted in the attach
   description at the first occurrence of the string "^a" in the attach
   description.  The default attach description is:

         tape_mult_ ^a -write -system

   If STR contains blanks, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
   This control argument is optional.


-preattach N
   specifies that N volumes are to be preattached before writing on the
   first volume.  This allows a site to operate the volume dumper
   without user intervention, by premounting the requested or supplied
   volumes.  The default is to not preattach.  This control argument is
   optional.
-purge_volume_log, -pvl
   specifies that the volume log of each physical volume dumped is to
   be purged using the values set with the set_volume_log command.
-restart STR
   specifies that the dump should restart from physical volume STR,
   which is implicitly or explicitly defined in the control file.  The
   default is to start at the last volume dumped.  This control
   argument is optional.


-trace
   specifies that the dumping process is to be traced.  As each segment
   is dumped to the output tape volume, its unique id and pathname is
   written to the user_output I/O switch.
-working_dir, -wd
   specifies that the volume backup databases are to be searched for
   relative to the working directory.  The default is to search
   relative to the >ddd>volume_backup directory.  This control argument
   is optional.


Notes:  If a dump terminates abnormally, reinvoke the
consolidated_volume_dump command.  The dump will be restarted and
reload groups will be kept consistent.  If the dump terminates again,
use the new_proc command to clean up the dumper process.  Then reinvoke
the consolidated_volume_dump command with the -restart argument.  The
-restart argument must be used after a new_proc to keep reload groups
consistent.
