02/27/85 salvage_mstb

Syntax as a command:  salvage_mstb path {N}


Function:  rebuilds an overloaded MSTB (PNT or URF), or recovers the
contents of a damaged MSTB.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the MSTB to be recovered.
N
   is the number of entries to make in the new table.  The default is
   three times the number of used entries in the old table, making the
   new MSTB 33% full.


Notes:  The PNT can only be salvaged by ring 1 process.  After
salvaging, and before any further logins, the system must be brought
down and then brought back up.

The URF can be salvaged whenever it is not in use by any process.

Entries in an MSTB are accessed using a hashing algorithm.  For most
efficient operation, it is recommended that the PNT be kept between 30%
and 50% full and the URF between 50% and 70% full.
