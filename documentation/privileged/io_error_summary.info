Control arguments:
-channel, -chn
   reports per channel status information for each device. The
   channel is displayed following the device name.

   record. Only disk_control syserr messages can be separated.
-detailed_status, -dtst
   displays detailed status if available.
-device STRs, -dv STRs
   reports information for the device(s) named, where STRs are device
   types ("prt") or device names ("prtb").


-for T
   computes the ending time from the starting time, where T is a
   relative time (such as "1 hour").
-from DT, -fm DT
   starts scanning the log at the date/time given.
-hex_detailed_status, -hxdtst
   displays detailed status in hexidecimal if available.
-io_command, -ioc

Access required:  Read permission is required on the log segments
themselves and status permission is required on their containing
directories.


Notes:  If -from DT is not specified, the scan starts with the earliest
message in the syserr log.  The ending time can be specified by using
-for, or -to, but not both.  If both are omitted, the scan terminates
with the last message in the log.  All dates and times must be in a
format acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_ described in the Multics
Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93).
