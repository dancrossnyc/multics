03/26/85 display_cpu_error

Syntax as a command:  display_cpu_error {-control_args}


Function:  scans the syserr log and displays machine conditions and
history registers.


Control arguments:
-from DT, -fm DT
   starts scanning the log at the date/time given.
-to DT
   stops scanning the log at the date/time given.
-for T
   computes the ending time from the starting time, where T is a
   relative time (such as "1hour").
-cpu CPU_LIST
   displays information for the CPUs specified, where CPU_LIST is a
   list of CPU tags (e.g., "a c").
-nothread
   specifies that the history registers are not to be threaded.  The
   history registers will be output in octal with no interpretation.
   The default is off.


-expand, -exp
   specifies that the history registers are not to be threaded but that
   they are to be interpreted.
-match STR...STRn
   matches strings against messages in the log, where STR is a text
   string.  Messages are defined to contain process or machine
   condition information.  Any message that contains a STRi is
   displayed.
-exclude STR1...STRn, -ex STR1...STRn
   matches strings against messages in the log as -match, where STR is
   a text string.  Any message that contains a STRi is NOT displayed.
-all
   specifies that all log entries that are defined to contain processor
   machine information can be displayed.


Access required:  Read permission is required on the log segments
themselves and status permission is required on their containing
directories.


Notes:  If -from DT is not given, the scan starts with the earliest
entry in the syserr log.  The ending time can be specified by using
-for or -to, but not both.  If both are omitted, the scan terminates
with the last entry in the log.  All dates and times must be in a
format acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine described
in the Multics Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93.

Unless the control arguments -all, -match, or -exclude are specified,
only hardware_fault entries will be processed.
