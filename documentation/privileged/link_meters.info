02/21/85 link_meters

Syntax as a command:  link_meters {-control_arg}


Function:  prints out per-process information regarding use of the
Multics linker.  The statistics are obtained from the Process
Descriptor Segment (PDS) of the process.  System-wide linkage
information can be obtained with the system_link_meters command.


Control arguments:
-report_reset, -rr
   generates a full report and then performs the reset operation.
-reset, -rs
   resets the metering interval for the invoking process so that the
   interval begins at the last call with -reset specified.  If -reset
   has never been given in a process, it is equivalent to having been
   specified at process initialization time.


Access required:  This command requires access to phcs_ or
metering_gate_.


Notes:  If the link_meters command is given with no control argument,
it prints a full report.

The following are brief descriptions of the variables printed by the
link_meters command.
slot
   is a time slot into which the calls to the linker are broken down.
   The four slots are for calls completed in less than 25 milliseconds,
   calls completed in between 25 and 50 ms, calls completed in between
   50 and 75 ms, and calls completed in more than 75 ms.
calls
   is the number of calls to the linker that are completed in each time
   slot and the total number of calls made to the linker by the
   process.


avg time
   is the average time (in milliseconds) to completion for a call in
   each slot and the average time to completion for all calls to the
   linker made by the process.
avg pf
   is the average number of page faults for a call in each slot and the
   average number of page faults for all calls made by the process.
tot time
   is the total virtual time (in seconds) taken by calls in each slot
   and the total virtual time spent in the linker by the process.  It
   equals calls times average time.
% time
   is the percentage of total linker time for the process that was
   taken by calls in each slot and the percentage taken by all calls.
