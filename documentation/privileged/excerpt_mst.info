01/13/87  excerpt_mst


Syntax as a command:  excerpt_mst input_spec {names} {-control_args}


Function:  excerpts (extracts) given segments from a Multics System
Tape, or from an MST image stored in a file.


Arguments:
input_spec
   can be either the -input_volume or -input_file control argument, or
   a reel identification number of the Multics System Tape.  The reel
   identification number, which is site dependent, can be up to 32
   characters long.
names
   are the names of the specific segments to be extracted.  The star
   convention is allowed.  If you supply no names, all of the segments
   on the tape are extracted.  If a given segment has separate linkage
   and definitions on the tape and has been extracted, the separate
   linkage and definitions are extracted as well.  Segments extracted
   are created in the current working directory.  Bit counts are set
   from the SLT entry on the tape, as opposed to the actual length of
   the segment on the tape.


Control arguments:
-input_volume volname, -ivol volname
   gives the input tape volume name of the MST to be listed.
-input_file path, -if path
   gives the pathname of a file containing an MST image.  This file
   must have been previously created by generate_mst or copy_mst.
-density DEN, -den DEN
   gives a tape density.  DEN may be 800, 1600 or 6250.  The input tape
   is mounted on a tape drive capable of reading density DEN.  However,
   the actual density at which the input tape is written determines the
   density used for reading.  The default density is 1600 BPI (bits per
   inch).


Notes:  A message is printed whenever a segment is extracted.  A
diagnostic is issued if you provide names that match no segments on the
tape.
