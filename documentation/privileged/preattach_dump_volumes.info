04/05/85 preattach_dump_volumes

Syntax as a command:  preattach_dump_volumes N


Function:  allows output dump volumes to be attached to a process which
is actively performing an incremental volume dump.  This command
performs the same functions as the -preattach control argument when it
is used with the incremental_volume_dump command.


Arguments:
N
   is the number of tape volumes to be preattached.  N must be less
   than or equal to 50.


Notes:  This command may be invoked repeatedly during the life of the
incremental volume dump process, but at no time may more than 50 tape
volumes be preattached.
