03/31/83  l_add_name, lan

Syntax:  lan path names


Function:  adds alternate name(s) to the existing name(s) of ring 1
segments and multisegment_files.  See the descriptions of the
l_delete_name and l_rename commands.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment, multisegment file, directory, or link
   to which an additional name is to be added.
names
   are additional names.  The star convention and the equal convention
   are allowed.


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_ gate is required.

The user must have modify permission on the directory that contains the
entry receiving the additional name.

Two entries in a directory cannot have the same entryname.  Therefore,
special action is taken by this command if the added name already
exists in the directory that contains the path argument.  If the added
name is an alternate name of another entry, the name is removed from
this entry, added to the entry specified by path, and the user is
informed of this action.  If the added name is the only name of another
entry, the user is asked if he wishes to delete this entry.  If he
answers "yes", the entry is deleted and the name is added to the entry
specified by path; if he answers "no", no action is taken.
