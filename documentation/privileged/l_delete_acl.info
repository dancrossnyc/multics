03/31/83  l_delete_acl, lda

Syntax:  lda {path} {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function:  removes entries from the access control lists (ACLs) of ring
1 segments and multisegment files.  For a description of ACLs, see the
Programmer's Reference Manual (AG91).


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment, multisegment file, or directory.  If
   it is -working_directory (-wd), or omitted, the working directory is
   assumed.  If path is omitted, no User_id can be specified.  The star
   convention can be used.
User_ids
   are access control names that must be of the form
   Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL entries with matching names are
   deleted.  (For a description of the matching strategy, refer to the
   set_acl command.)  If no User_id is given, the user's Person_id and
   current Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes the entire ACL with the exception of an entry for
   *.SysDaemon.*.
-directory, -dr
   deletes ACLs for only directories.  The default is segments,
   multisegment files, and directories.
-segment, -sm
   deletes ACLs for only segments and multisegment files.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "User name not on ACL."


Notes:  Execute access to the installation_tools_ gate is required.

If the l_delete_acl command is invoked with no arguments, it deletes
the entry for the user's Person_id and current Project_id on the ACL of
the working directory.

An ACL entry for *.SysDaemon.* can be deleted only by specifying all
three components.  The user should be aware that in deleting access to
the SysDaemon project he prevents Backup.SysDaemon.* from saving the
segment or directory (including the hierarchy inferior to the
directory) on tape, Dumper.SysDaemon.* from reloading it, and
Retriever.SysDaemon.* from retrieving it.

The user needs modify permission on the containing directory.
