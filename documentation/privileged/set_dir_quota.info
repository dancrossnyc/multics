Syntax as a command:  set_dir_quota path1 quota1 ...  pathN quotaN


Function:  places an arbitrary secondary storage quota for directories
on a specified directory.  Incorrect use of this command can make
portions of the hierarchy unusable because of quota violations.


Arguments:
pathi
   is the name of the directory on which the directory quota is to be
   placed.  The active function -wd can be used to specify the working
   directory.
quotai
   is the directory quota in 1024 word pages.


Access required:  The user must have access to the highly privileged
gate hphcs_ to use this command.


Notes:  No permission in the directory is required to use this command.
It is not necessary that the new directory quota be greater than the
current number of pages being used by directories in this directory.
This command attempts to set a terminal directory quota even if it set
set to zero.  This command does not cause the inferior counts of the
superior directory to be updated.
