01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  help

Syntax:  help {topics} {-control_args}


Function:  prints information about various subsystem topics including
detailed descriptions of most subsystem requests.


Arguments:
topics
   are the topics on which information is to be printed.  The topics
   available within a subsystem can be determined by using the
   list_help request if available.


Control arguments:
   The most useful control arguments for the help request are:
-title
   prints section titles and section line counts, then asks if the user
   wants to see the first paragraph of information.
-brief, -bf
   prints only a summary of a request or active request, including the
   Syntax section, list of arguments, control arguments, etc.
-section STRs, -scn STRs
   begins printing at the section whose title contains all the strings
   STRs.  By default, printing begins at the top of the information.
-search STRs, -srh STRs
   begins printing with the paragraph containing all the strings STRs.
   By default, printing begins at the top of the information.


List of responses:
   The most useful responses which can be given to questions asked by
   the help request are:
yes, y
   prints the next paragraph of information on this topic.
no, n
   stops printing information for this topic and proceeds to the next
   topic if any.
quit, q
   stops printing information for this topic and returns to the
   subsystem's request level.


rest {-scn}, r {-scn}
   prints remaining information for this topic without intervening
   questions.  If -section or -scn is given, help prints only the rest
   of the current section without questions and then asks if the user
   wants to see the next section.
title {-top}
   lists titles and line counts of the sections which follow; if -top
   or -t is given, help lists all section titles.  help then repeats
   the previous question after titles are printed.


section {STRs} {-top},
scn {STRs} {-top}
   skips to the next section whose title contains all the strings STRs.
   If -top or -t is given, title searching starts at the top of the
   information.  If STRs are omitted, help uses the STRs from the
   previous section response or the -section control argument.
search {STRs} {-top},
srh {STRs} {-top}
   skips to the next paragraph containing all the strings STRs.  If
   -top or -t is given, searching starts at top of the information.  If
   STRs are omitted, help uses the STRs from the previous search
   response or the -search control argument.


skip {-scn} {-seen}
s {-scn} {-seen}
   skips to the next paragraph.  If -section or -scn is given, skips
   all paragraphs of the current section.  If -seen is given, skips to
   the next paragraph which the user has not seen.  Only one control
   argument is allowed in each skip response.


?
   prints the list of responses allowed to help queries.
.
   prints "help" to identify the current interactive environment.
.. command_line
   treats the remainder of the response as a Multics command line.


Notes:
If given no topic names, the help request will explain what requests
are available in the subsystem to obtain information on the subsystem.
