01/25/82  Standard subsystem request:  debug_mode

Syntax:  debug_mode -control_arg


Function:  enables or disables debugging mode for the current subsystem.


Control arguments:
-on
   enables debugging mode for this subsystem.  (Default)
-off
   disables debugging mode for this subsystem.


Notes:
This request is intended for use only by subsystem implementors.

When debugging mode is enabled, all calls to abort the subsystem or a
request line will instead establish a new Multics command level.  In
addition, all areas obtained on behalf of the subsystem will have the
freeing operation disabled.
