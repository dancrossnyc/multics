03/21/85 restart_q

Syntax as a command:  restart_q {minor_device}


Function:  signals the coordinator to start taking requests from the
beginning of the queue again.  This allows any deferred requests to be
run if the operator has changed the deferring criteria (see the
defer_time command in this section).


Arguments:
minor_device
   is the name of one of the minor devices being run by the driver.  It
   identifies the request type queues to be restarted.  It is optional
   for drivers with a single minor device.


Notes:  When several drivers are running from a single device class,
and several requests in the queues are still in progress, it is
possible that some requests will be repeated.
