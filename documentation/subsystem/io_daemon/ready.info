03/21/85 ready

Syntax as a command:  ready dev1 ...  devN {-control_arg}


Function:  places the device and the specified minor devices in the
active or "ready" state.  The driver only requests service from the
coordinator for a ready device.  This command performs the reverse
function of the halt command.


Arguments:
devi
   is the name of a device, or minor device in the case of a
   multifunction device, that is to be placed in the ready state.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   to place all devices in the ready state.  If the -all control
   argument is used, no device names need be given.  If there is only
   one device, no control argument is required.  In this case, the
   ready command is executed automatically during driver
   initialization.  If there are multiple minor devices, the operator
   must specify the ones to be made ready or else must specify -all to
   make all minor devices ready.
