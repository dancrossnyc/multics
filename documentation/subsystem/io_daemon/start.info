Syntax as a command:  start


Function:  allows the driver to resume operations suspended at other
than the normal command level, e.g., after a quit signal.  Its function
is similar to the standard Multics start command.  The start command
cannot be issued at normal command level (see the go command).


After a quit signal, this is the only command that allows control to be
returned to the point of process interruption.  The action of the hold
command is reset when a start command is issued.
