03/20/85 halt

Syntax as a command:  halt dev1 ...  devn {control_arg}


Function:  provides the reverse function of the ready command.  It
places the device or each of the specified minor devices in the
inactive state.  The driver does not ask the coordinator for any
further requests for a halted device.  However, the coordinator may
have already supplied a "pending request" for the halted device.  In
this case, any pending request is processed immediately after the
device has been halted (except when the command has been issued
following a quit signal).


Arguments:
devi
   is the name of a device, or minor device in the case of a
   multifunction device, that is to be placed in the inactive state.
   The device names that can be used are those printed out by the
   status command.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   specifies that all devices are to be halted.  If the -all control
   argument is used, no device names need be specified.  If there is
   only one device neither the device name nor -all need be specified.
