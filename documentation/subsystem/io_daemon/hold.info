03/21/85 hold

Syntax as a command:  hold


Function:  is used to hold the driver at command level.


Notes:  When the hold command is issued from the master terminal, the
slave terminal is unable to issue any command that would cause the
driver to leave command level until the master terminal has issued a go
command (or a start command following a quit signal).  This command
should always be used following a quit signal if the automatic start is
to be canceled.
