03/21/85 pun_control

Syntax as a command:  pun_control {minor_device} {control_mode}
   {-control_args}


Function:  is used by remote drivers at normal command level to set the
punch control modes.  This command does not apply to the central site
punch driver.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is the name of the punch minor device which the command is
   addressing.  This argument is optional if there is only one punch
   minor device, but is required otherwise.


control_mode
   specifies the modes to be set.  The mode name may be preceded by the
   character "^" to reset the mode.  This argument is optional.  If not
   given, the current modes for the specified minor device are printed.
   The following mode is currently defined:
   autopunch
      this mode allows the driver to process punch requests
      continuously without operator intervention.  When this mode is
      not set (i.e., ^autopunch) the driver will come to request
      command level after printing the log message and wait for the
      operator to give the "punch" command before continuing.


Control arguments:
-print
   if control_mode is not given, or if this control argument is given
   alone, the modes are printed.


Notes:  The ^autopunch mode is normally used by a remote operator to
allow the output to be directed to a particular device based on
information in the log message.  Once the proper device has been
assigned, the operator must type "punch" for the driver to continue
with the user's request.
