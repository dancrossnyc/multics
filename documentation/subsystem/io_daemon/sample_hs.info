Syntax as a command:  sample_hs {minor_device}


Function:  prints a sample head sheet to align the paper before
starting to print or after loading more paper.  This command should not
be used in the middle of a request (e.g., after a quit) unless the
request is restarted using the restart command.  Otherwise, the page
restart feature of the printer driver is placed out of synchronization.

minor_device
   is a minor device name (as shown by the status command) and is
   required if there is more than one printer minor device.
