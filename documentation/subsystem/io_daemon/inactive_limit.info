03/21/85 inactive_limit

Syntax as a command:  inactive_limit {N}


Function:  allows the I/O Daemon to log out automatically after a
specified period of inactivity.


Arguments:
N
   is the number of minutes of inactivity allowed.  N may be from zero
   to 200 minutes.  Zero indicates no automatic logout; this is the
   default.  The current inactivity limit is displayed if N is not
   given.


Notes:  The inactivity time counter is reset when a request or command
is received or a quit is signalled, as well as when the driver
processes a new request.  A driver at command level is considered
active.

An inactivity logout will reinitialize a remote driver so that another
station can log in and use the line.
