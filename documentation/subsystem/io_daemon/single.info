03/21/85 single

Syntax as a command:  single


Function:  sets the single mode of the printer DIM so that form feed
and vertical tab characters are treated as newline characters for the
current request.  It also cancels any additional requested copies that
have not been processed by the driver.  The single command is used
after a quit to stop runaway paper feeding caused, for example, by the
printing of a non-ASCII segment.  The command applies only to drivers
that operate a printer.
