03/20/85 cancel

Syntax as a command:  cancel


Function:  terminates the request that the driver is currently
processing.  The request is not placed in the coordinator's saved list
and thus cannot be restarted later.  This command is only valid after a
quit signal, or at request command level.


Notes:  After completing the command, the driver looks for another
request to process.  (In step mode, it returns to command level.)
