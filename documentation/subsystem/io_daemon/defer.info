Syntax as a command:  defer


Function:  sends the current request back to its queue marked as
deferred.  It is only issued from quit command level or request command
level.


Notes:  Requests are automatically deferred when the requested line
length of the device exceeds the physical line length, or when the
estimated processing time of a request exceeds the operator-defined
limit (see the defer_time command below).

A deferred request will be reprocessed when the driver is given the
restart_q command or when the coordinator is next initialized.
