Syntax as a command:  banner_bars {minor_device} {arg}


Function:  used by printer drivers to establish how the separator bars
at the bottom of the head sheet are to be printed.  Printers that can
overstrike should use "double" (this is the default).  Other printers
should use single.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is a minor device name (as shown by the status command) and is
   required if there is more than one printer minor device; arg can be
   one of the following separator types:
   double
      overstrikes each separator line.
   single
      single strikes each separator line.
   none
      suppresses separator lines.
   -print
      if arg is not given, or if a single arg "-print", is given, the
      current value is printed.
