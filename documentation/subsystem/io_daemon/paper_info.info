03/21/85 paper_info

Syntax as a command:  paper_info {minor_device} {-control_args}


Function:  defines the physical characteristics of the paper as used by
the printer software.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is a minor device name (as shown by the status command) and is
   required if there is more than one printer minor device


Control arguments:
-print
   print the current values.  If this is given, it must be the only
   control arg.
-ll N
   sets the line length to N, where N is a decimal integer from 10 to
   200.
-pl N
   sets the page length to N, where N is a decimal integer from 10 to
   127.
-lpi N
   sets the number of lines per inch to N, where N is either 6 or 8.

   If no control arguments are given, the current values are printed.


Notes:  If the printer uses a firmware VFC image, a new image is loaded
(which causes the printer to go into an unsynchronized state).
Otherwise, the operator is told to mount a new VFU tape.
