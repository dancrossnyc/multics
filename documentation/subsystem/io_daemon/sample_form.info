03/21/85 sample_form

Syntax as a command:  sample_form


Function:  prints a sample of the data used to record request
processing on the control terminal.  The primary function of this
command is to verify the alignment of the forms on the control
terminal.  The data is formatted by the program that is called for each
copy of each request.  (See the ctl_term command.)


Notes:  If form feed simulation is being used, the command checks to
see if alignment has been set.  If not, it is set before the sample
form is printed.

The sample_form command applies to all drivers that use a control
terminal.
