03/20/85 ctl_term

Syntax as a command:  ctl_term arg


Function:  applies only to a control terminal (if attached).  It allows
the operator to specify the format of printed output.

One of the primary functions of the control terminal is to print
information about each request processed, to aid in separating the
output, and to ensure proper accountability of output generated by the
driver.  It is possible for the site to use preprinted forms for this
purpose.  (for information on preprinted forms, see the Multics System
Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81.)  In this case,
alignment of the data on the form is very important.  Generally a
terminal that supports vertical tab and form feed control characters is
used to ensure alignment.  However, this command allows the operator to
request that the software simulate the action of form feed control
characters if the terminal does not provide this hardware support.


Arguments:
   where arg falls into one of two classes:  general control or
   simulation control (some arguments require an additional value to
   define the requested action).

   general control
   form_type STR
      specifies the format program to be used to format the data
      printed on the control terminal.  If STR is "default", the
      form_type is set to the default format.
   detach
      discontinues the use of the control terminal.  This argument is
      restricted to the master terminal and is not reversible unless
      the reinit command is given.


   simulation control
   simulate
      sets the driver to simulate form feeds by software.  (This
      argument is not reversible even by the reinit command.)
   page_length N
      sets the number of lines per logical page to N.  This controls
      the forward spacing needed to go to the top of the form.
   aligned
      indicates that the forms are aligned for the purpose of form feed
      control.  (A sample form can be printed by the sample_form
      command.)
