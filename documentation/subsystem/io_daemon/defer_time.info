03/20/85 defer_time

Syntax as a command:  defer_time {minor_device} {N}


Function:  sets or displays the current time limit for automatically
deferring requests.


Arguments:
minor_device
   is the name of the minor device for which the time should be set or
   displayed.  It is optional for drivers that have only one minor
   device (e.g., the central site printer).  If specified, this
   argument must be the first argument.
N
   sets a new defer time in minutes, with a precision of tenths (e.g.,
   1.5 is one minute, 30 seconds).  A time of zero indicates that
   infinite time is allowed.  If N is not given, the current defer time
   and driver output rate are displayed.
