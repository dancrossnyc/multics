Syntax as a command:  step {arg}


Function:  sets (puts the driver into) or resets (takes the driver out
of) step mode.  When in step mode, the driver returns to command level
after processing each request from the coordinator.  When not in step
mode, the driver processes requests from the coordinator as soon as
received without operator interaction.  Step mode is useful for
checking the alignment of paper on the printer or other device
functions prior to allowing the driver to run continuously without
operator interaction.


Arguments:
set, reset
   to put the driver into or take the driver out of step mode.  If no
   argument is supplied, step mode is set.  The driver is not in step
   mode immediately after driver initialization.
