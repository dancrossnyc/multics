Syntax as a command:  sample {N}


Function:  used by printer drivers at request command level to print a
sample page of the file for paper alignment or to verify the starting
position in the file.  The current position of a new request is always
page 1.  The same page may be printed as often as needed.


Arguments:
N
   is the page number that the driver prints.  If N is omitted, the
   driver prints the current page in the file.


Notes:  If N is preceded by a "+" or "-", the number is relative to the
current page of the file.  For example, "sample +3" skips forward three
pages and prints the page; "sample -8" skips backward eight pages and
prints the page.  Similarly, "sample 500" skips to page number 500 and
prints it.


If the page number specified is beyond the end of the file, an error
message is printed similar to what is shown below.

      End-of-File record encountered. EOF at page 2000, line 10.
      Unable to skip to starting page.
      Enter command(request):

      and a new command is requested.

The sample command prints a page with separator bars as an aid to
the operator in indicating the sample pages so they can be
discarded.
