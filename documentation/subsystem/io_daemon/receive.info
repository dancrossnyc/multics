Syntax as a command:  receive


Function:  causes the driver to wait for output files to be transmitted
from the remote system.  A message is issued at the start and end of
each file received.  If automatic queueing of output files is enabled
for this simulated device, output files will be locally printed or
punched after they have been successfully received; otherwise, the
output files will be placed into system pool storage as specified by
the ++IDENT control records which must be present in the files.
