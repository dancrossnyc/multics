03/21/85 station

Syntax as a command:  station station_id {station_password}


Function:  used by a driver to identify and validate a remote station.
This command is similar to the standard Multics login command.


Arguments:
station_id
   is the registered id of the station, as defined by the
   administrator.
station_password
   is the registered password for the remote station.


Notes:  The station's identifier and password are registered in the PNT
using the card input password as the station password and are supplied
by the administrator for each station location.

If the remote station includes an operator's terminal with keyboard and
CRT or printer, the station password may be omitted from the station
command.  The system will then request the station password and either
suppress printing of the password or hide it with a suitable mask.
This feature is particularly useful when a remote station is actually a
high-quality letter printer (e.g., a Diablo 1640), where the printer is
used both as the slave console and as the actual output device.


Remote stations that have no input device do not have to give a station
command.  However, these stations must use a dedicated phone line and
have the station identifier specified in the iod_tables for Type II
remote stations.
