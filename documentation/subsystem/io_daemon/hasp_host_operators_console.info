03/20/85  hasp_host_operators_console, hhoc

Syntax as a command:  hhoc tty_channel {control_arguments}
   {attach_arguments}


Function:  is used to simulate the operation of the operator's console
of a HASP workstation.  The operator's console is used to identify a
workstation to a remote system, to issue commands governing the
operation of the workstation, and to receive status information from
the remote system.


Arguments:
tty_channel
   is the name of the terminal channel to be attached as the operator's
   console.  This channel must be configured as the console sub-channel
   of a HASP multiplexer channel (eg:  a.h014.op).  See the Multics
   Communications Administrator's Manual, Order No.  CC75, for a
   further description of the HASP multiplexer.


Control arguments:
-signon STR
   specifies that the remote host requires a SIGNON record to be
   transmitted before data transmission may occur.  STR is the text of
   the control record; it may be up to 80 characters in length.  Before
   transmission it is translated to uppercase and the remote system's
   character is set.
-no_signon
   specifies that the remote host does not require a SIGNON record.
   (Default)


attach_arguments
   are options acceptable to the hasp_host_ I/O module.  This command
   supplies the -comm, -tty, and -device options automatically; these
   options need not be given on the command line.  (See the Multics
   Subroutines and I/O Modules manual, Order No.  AG93 for a
   description of the hasp_host_ I/O module.)


Notes:  If the remote system requires a SIGNON, the -signon option
should be supplied on the command line specifying the exact SIGNON
record to be transmitted.


List of hasp_host_operators_console requests:  The following requests
are recognized by hasp_host_operators_console when given at the
beginning of a line of terminal input:
 .. <REST_OF_LINE>
   the rest of the line is passed to the Multics command processor for
   execution as ordinary commands.


 .
   prints a message of the form:

         hasp_host_operators_console N.N; connected to channel NAME.

   where N.N is the current version of this program and NAME identifies
   the channel connected as a console to the remote system.
 quit
   causes the command to hangup the operator's console channel and
   return to Multics command level.
