Syntax as a command:  new_device


Function:  terminates the current device.  The driver then asks the
operator to enter a new "command or device/request_type" as described
under "Driver Initialization with a Control Terminal" above.

The coordinator is notified of the termination of the current device
and the device is detached by the process.  If a control terminal has
been attached, it also is detached.

The new_device command may only be issued from the master terminal.
