03/20/85 go

Syntax as a command:  go {N}


Function:  specifies that the driver is to search for requests to
process.  If no requests are currently available, the driver asks the
coordinator for a request for each "ready" device.  These requests are
processed as soon as they are provided by the coordinator.  (This
command may not be used at request command level or immediately
following a quit signal.)


Arguments:
N
   is the number of requests processed before the driver returns to
   command level.  If N is not specified, the driver will continue to
   process requests and will not return to command level until
   requested by the operator.
