Syntax as a command:  print {N}


Function:  starts the actual printing of a file when the driver is at
request command level.  This command is used by printer drivers only.


Arguments:
N
   is a decimal integer that identifies the page at which the driver
   starts printing.  If this argument is omitted, printing starts at
   the current page of the file.


Notes:  A "+" or "-" preceding the page number indicates that the
number is relative to the current page.

If the starting page number is beyond the end of the file, an error
message is printed, and a new command is requested.

The print command causes a normal head sheet to be printed complete
with separator bars if needed.  The head sheet is followed by the
current page of the file.
