Syntax as a command:  next -control_args


Function:  specifies which request is to be taken from the queues next.
This allows the operator to specify priority requests and the order in
which they are to be run.


Control arguments:
-user Person_id.Project_id
   specifies the submitter of the request by user_id.  The full person
   and project names must be given.  This control argument is required.
   At least one other argument must be chosen from the request
   identifiers -entry, -path, and -id.
-entry STR, -et STR
   specifies the entryname of the request.  Starnames are not allowed.
   This control argument may not be used with the -path control
   argument.
-id ID
   specifies the match id of the request.


-path path, -pn path
   specifies the full pathname of the request.  Relative pathnames and
   starnames are not allowed.  This control argument may not be used
   with the -entry control argument.
-device STR, -dev STR
   specifies which of the driver's minor devices the command is being
   given for.  This control argument is optional for drivers with a
   single minor device, but is required for drivers with multiple minor
   devices.  It serves to identify which request type the coordinator
   will search to find the request.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies that only queue N of the request type should be searched
   to find a matching request.  This argument is optional; if not
   given, all queues will be searched.


Notes:  All requests to be run by the next command will be charged as
though they came from queue 1.

Requests chosen to run next will be run after any restarted requests
(see the restart command in this section).

This command may be given several times before a go command, to specify
the exact order that requests in the queues are processed.
