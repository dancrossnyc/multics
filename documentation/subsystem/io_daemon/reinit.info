03/21/85 reinit

Syntax as a command:  reinit


Function:  reinitializes the driver.  The same device(s) and request
type(s) are used without requesting operator input.  However, remote
stations have to reissue the station command and any new default
request types.  Also, if a control terminal is attached to the driver,
its attachment, form simulation mode, and form type are retained over
the reinitialization.  Each device and request type is again requested
from the coordinator.

The reinit command to the driver is almost the same as the standard
Multics new_proc command.
