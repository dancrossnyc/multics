03/21/85 kill

Syntax as a command:  kill


Function:  terminates the request that the driver is currently
processing.  The request is passed back to the coordinator and placed
in the saved list where it may be restarted if desired (within the
limits of the coordinator save time).

After completing the command, the driver looks for another request to
process.  (In step mode, it returns to command level.)
