Syntax as a command:  restart {arg}


Function:  used either to restart processing of the current request
after a device malfunction or to reprocess requests in the
coordinator's saved list.


Arguments:
N
   is the number of the request to be restarted.  The coordinator
   searches its saved list for a matching request.  If found, the
   request will be re-processed ahead of any other requests, including
   those from the "next" command.  If the request had been saved in the
   middle of a copy (suspended), the request will be restarted
   beginning at the top of the following page; a punch request will
   start at the beginning of that copy.
-from N
   specifies that all requests in the series beginning with request N
   are to be restarted.  This is an implicit save of all requests in
   the series.


Notes:  When the restart command is issued directly after a quit
signal, with no arguments, the driver's current request is restarted.
For print requests, the current page number, minus 5, and copy number
are displayed and the driver goes to request command level.  For punch
requests, the number of copies completed (if more than one) is
displayed and the operator is asked to note how many were good.

The user is charged for the requested number of copies only, regardless
of how many copies were produced by this command.

If the request number series of a restarted request is still active,
the driver will be switched to another series.  Each restarted request
is assigned a new request number, and any subsequent restart must be
based on the new request number.
