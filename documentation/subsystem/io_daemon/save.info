Syntax as a command:  save {arg}


Function:  tells the coordinator that one or a series of requests are
to be retained beyond the normal holding time.  The action is limited
to requests in the specified request number series.  The save command
allows requests to be saved for possible restarting until the
coordinator is logged out.


Arguments:
N
   specifies the request number in the coordinator's saved list.  The
   coordinator searches its list of finished requests and marks the
   matching request number as saved for later restarting.  The request
   remains in the saved list until the request is restarted by the
   restart command or until the coordinator is next initialized.


-from N
   specifies that all requests in the series beginning with request N
   are retained in the saved list.

   If no argument is given, the current request will be returned to the
   coordinator and saved for later restarting.  For printers, the
   request will be processed to the bottom of the next even page and a
   normal tail sheet will be printed, showing a charge of zero.  When
   the request is later restarted, printing will begin at the top of
   the next odd page.


Notes:  Once a saved request is restarted, it is not saved any longer
than the normal retention time.  The coordinator never deletes the
user's segment while the request is being saved.
