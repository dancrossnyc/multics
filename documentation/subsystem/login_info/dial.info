07/09/87  dial, d

Syntax:  d dial_id {User_id} {-control_args}


Function: connects an additional terminal to an existing process.  It
requests the answering service to connect and notifies your process of
the connection.


Arguments:
dial_id
   is the identifying keyword, supplied by a logged-in process, that
   uniquely specifies that process that is accepting dial connections.
User_id
   is the Person_id.Project_id of the process that you wish to connect
   to.  This argument is required only if the dial_id is not registered
   with the system.  A registered alias can be given for the Person_id
   and Project_id.


Control arguments:
-authorization ACCESS_CLASS, -auth ACCESS_CLASS
   specifies the AIM level and category, or categories, of the data
   that will be transmitted to and from the system in this session.  If
   you don't provide it, the default authorization from the PNT is
   used.  You can only supply it with -user.
-no_print_off, -npf
   tells the system that the terminal cannot stop printing while a
   password is being entered.  The system prints a mask field to
   overwrite the area in which the password will be typed.
-print_off, -pf
   tells the system that the terminal can stop printing while a
   password is being entered.  No password mask is printed.


-user Own_person_id, -user Own_user_id
   specifies a User_id to give when validating access to the
   communications channel.  Own_person_id is your registered personal
   identifier; Own_user_id is your Person_id.Project_id.  If you supply
   no Project_id, the default project associated with the Own_person_id
   is used.  A registered alias can be given for the Person_id
   and Project_id.


Notes: When you invoke dial, the answering service searches for a
logged-in process accepting dial connections using the dial_id you
provided.  If not found, the message "Dial line not active."  is
printed and you can try again, with a different dial_id; if found, a
one-line message verifying the connection is printed.  All further
messages printed on the terminal are from your process.

This request is administratively restricted.  The project administrator
must register you and your project if you want dialed terminals.  The
system administrator must register the dial_id if you want dialed
terminals without Own_user_id and can restrict your access to a login
service communications channel.  Give -user with your User_id.  This
request then asks for your password ensuring its nonvisibility.  When
your identification and permission to use the channel are verified the
dial request is processed.


All arguments must be supplied in the correct order.

If your process terminates or logs out, a message is printed and
control of the terminal is returned to the answering service.
