03/30/87  logout

Syntax:  logout {-control_args}


Function: terminates your session and ends communication with the
Multics system.  It is used from a terminal that is logged in but not
connected to a process.  (See "Notes on disconnected processes" in
login.info.) It informs the answering service that the user who gave a
correct Person_id-password combination is no longer using the
terminal.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints neither the logout message nor, if you give -hold, the login
   message.
-hold, -hd
   terminates your session but not communication with the system:  you
   can immediately log in without redialing.
-long, -lg
   prints both the logout message, and if -hold is given, the login
   message. (Default)
-no_hold, -nhd
   terminates your session and drops your communication line. (Default)


Notes: If your site is security conscious, it may have disabled
"logout -hold"; in this case if you wish to change authorization, do
this:
   1. log out
   2. verify, using terminal/modem indications, that the terminal has
      dropped DTR and that the system acknowledged by dropping DSR
   3. log in at the new authorization.

This procedure is the only way to guarantee that you are communicating
with the answering service and not with a Trojan horse.
