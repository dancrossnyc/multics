01/07/87  load_from_tape, lft


Syntax as a command:  lft tape_name {-control_args}


Function:  loads MPC firmware, ITRs, MDRs, and T&D test pages from the
Integrated, Firmware And Diagnostic (IFAD) tape into a tandd_deck_file.
In addition, MPC firmware modules are loaded into individual segments
in a form acceptable to the generate_mst command, in order that they
may be written onto the Multics Boot Tape.  Also, a DN6670 Binary Deck
Tape may also be loaded into the tandd_deck_file.


Arguments:
tape_name
   specifies the name of the tape to be used.  See "Notes on tape name"
   below.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages from deckfile_manager specifying the
   deckfile.list and tandd_deck_file that will be used for this
   request.
-copy <copy_vol> {-copy_args}, -cp <copy_vol> {-copy_args}
   produces a tailored copy of an IFAD tape for use with offline T&D.
   Only those modules applicable to Multics are written to the copy
   tape.  The -copy argument is mutually exclusive with the -deckfile,
   -firmware.  For a list of -copy_args, see "List of copy args" below.



-density <value>, -den <value>
   specifies the initial density setting for tape attachment.  Although
   the density of the input tape is automatically determined, some tape
   subsystems may not have tape drives capable of handling the default
   density of 1600 bpi.  The allowable values for <value> are 6250,
   1600, 800, 556, or 200.  See "Notes on tape name" below.
-firmware, -fw
   specifies that only firmware modules are to be loaded into
   individual segments; no deckfile or listing file is produced.  This
   argument is mutually exclusive with the -deckfile, -list, and -copy
   arguments.


-patches
   allows patches with zero checksums to be accepted.  The checksum is
   adjusted before the record is written to the deckfile.
-track <n>, -tk <n>
   where <n> is 7 or 9 (for 7- or 9-track tapes).  If the -track
   argument is not specified, 9-track is assumed.
Notes
   The default action of this command, if no control arguments are
   specified, is to load all modules on the tape that are applicable to
   Multics into the deckfile and all firmware modules into individual
   segments.


   Firmware segments are created (in memory image format) using a four
   component entry name:

      fw.<name>.<ident>.<fw_rev>

   where name is the name of the device, ident is taken from the
   MPC-assembler IDENT pseudo-op card, and fw_rev is the firmware
   revision.


   Each module that is read from the tape and written to the deckfile
   is copied as-is in GCOS object deck format.  Each object deck
   occupies one record of the keyed sequential deckfile.  The record
   search key is formed from information obtained from the $!OBJECT
   card.


   Catalog records are built for all tape files while the respective
   tape files are being read.  These catalog records are merely a list
   of all of the search keys associated with each individual tape file.
   Each catalog record is written to the deckfile immediately following
   each tape file, and have record search keys in the form:

      cata.itr.<mpc_name>.<fw_rev> - for an ITR catalog
   or

      cata.mdr.<grp_name>.<file> - for an MDR catalog
   where:
      <mpc_name>  is the name taken from the ident pseudo-op card image
      <grp_name>  is the name of the generic peripheral group and can
                  be either tape, disk, print, or card
      <fw_rev>    is the revision of the mpc firmware in this file.
                  For the urcmpc itr/firmware file, it is the revision
                  of the common mpc firmware.



Notes on tape name:  The tape name may be of any format, but it is
recommended that the name used reflect the tape being read, ie an ifad
tape would be ifad.b3 or for a FNP 6670 tape name would be 6670-a3.
This name is added to the tandd_deck_file and deckfile.list files and
can be used as a record of revision of the source used to create the
deckfile.  The convention of "tape_name,density" where density is the
density of the tape, is also supported.


List of copy args::
 The copy_args pertain only to the <copy_vol> and may be chosen from
the following:
-density <value>, -den <value>
    sets the density of the copy tape to <value>.  The allowable values
   for <value> are 6250, 1600, 800, 556, and 200.  If the -density
   argument is not specified, the copy tape is set to the density of
   the input tape.
-track <n>, -tk <n>
   where n is 7 or 9 (for 7- or 9-track tapes).  If the -track argument
   is not specified, 9-track is assumed.
