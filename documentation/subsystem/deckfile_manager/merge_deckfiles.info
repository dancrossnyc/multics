01/07/87  merge_deckfiles, mdf

Syntax as a command:  mdf path1...3 -output_file deckfile_path


Function:  merge three existing deckfiles specified by <path1...3> into
an existing or to be created tandd_deck_file.


Arguments:
path1....3
   is the pathname of a tandd_deck_file entry.  See "Notes on input
   paths" below.



Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages from deckfile_manager announcing the
   deckfile.list and tandd_deck_file that will be used for this
   request.
-output_file deckfile_path, -of deckfile_path
   specifies that the deckfile_path is the target deckfile to be used
   for this requests.  See "Notes on output path" below.



Notes on input paths:  The input path is the path of an existing
deckfile.  This arg maybe an absolute or relative path, or it may be
either the string "-system", "-sys", "-working_dir", or "-wd".  The
"-system" will default to the tandd_deck_file in >system_library_tandd.



Notes on -output_file:  If the deckfile_path is not given on the
request line then the following sequence is used.  If a deckfile_path
is entered in the deckfile_manager command line, it is used.  Otherwise
the user is queried for a path of the target deckfile.  The user may
reply with either a absolute or relative pathname or with the string
"-system", "-sys", "-working_dir", or -wd".  The user's effective
access is checked, and if it is sufficient and the entry does not exist
the user is queried as to the creation of the tandd_deck_file or
deckfile.list.  If the reply is no and the user has sufficient
effective access to modify the tandd_deck_file in
>system_library_tandd, the user is again query as to its usage.  If no
tandd_deck_file is found the command is aborted.
