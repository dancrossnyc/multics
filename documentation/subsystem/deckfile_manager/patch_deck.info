Syntax as a command:  pd {key}


Function:  add or delete $patch cards to a deck in a tandd_deck_file .


Arguments:
KEY
   is a key obtained by the user from a deckfile.list which identifies
   a particular deck in a tandd_deck_file.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages from deckfile_manager announcing the
   deckfile.list and tandd_deck_file that will be used for this
   request.
-deckfile deckfile_path, -df deckfile_path
   specifies that the deckfile_path is the target deckfile to be used
   for this requests.
-delete, -dl
   will query the user for deletion of all patches encountered in a
   specified deck.



Notes:  If the add patch function is requested, the user will be
queried as to the type of patch (octal or hex) and then for the patch
data.



Notes on deckfile_path:  If the deckfile_path is not given on the
request line then the following sequence is used.  If a deckfile_path
is entered in the deckfile_manager command line, it is used.  Otherwise
the current working_dir is searched for an entry, if one is found the
user is notified of its use.  If an entry is not found and the user has
sufficient effective access, the user is queried as to the creation of
the tandd_deck_file or deckfile.list.  If the reply is no and the user
has sufficient effective access to modify the tandd_deck_file in
>system_library_tandd, the user is again query as to its usage.  If no
tandd_deck_file is found the command is aborted.



Notes on key:  key is unique identifier for each file in a
tandd_deck_file and may be up to 24 characters in length.  If no key is
supplied the user will be requested to supply one.  The key may be
obtained from a deckfile.list and can be inputted as either a complete
or partial key.  If a partial key is supplied the user is queried for
each match of the given key.
