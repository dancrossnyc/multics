12/03/86  list, ls

Syntax as a command:  ls {key} {-control_args}


Function:  create a deckfile.list from a tandd_deck_file.


Arguments:
key
   is a key obtained from a tandd_deck_file.list which identifies a
   particular deck in a tandd_deck_file.  If a key is specified, output
   by default is directed to the user terminal.  If no key is
   specified, the default is to the deckfile.list entry.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   make a complete deckfile.list.  If requested, the output is directed
   to the deckfile.list entry.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages from deckfile_manager specifying the
   deckfile.list and tandd_deck_file that will be used for this
   request.
-deckfile deckfile_path, -df deckfile_path
   specifies that the deckfile_path is the target deckfile to be used
   for all requests.
-file_out -fo
   direct output to the deckfile.list
-term_out -to
   direct output to the user terminal.



Notes:  If a required argument or information is missing the user is
queried for the required information.



Notes on deckfile_path:  If the deckfile_path is not given on the
request line then the following sequence is used.  If a deckfile_path
is entered in the deckfile_manager command line, it is used.  Otherwise
the current working_dir is searched for an entry, if one is found the
user is notified of its use.  If an entry is not found and the user has
sufficient effective access, the user is queried as to the creation of
the tandd_deck_file and/or the deckfile.list.  If the reply is no and
the user has sufficient effective access to modify the tandd_deck_file
in >system_library_tandd, the user is again query as to its usage.  If
no tandd_deck_file is found the command is aborted.



Notes on key:  key is unique identifier for each file in a
tandd_deck_file and may be up to 24 characters in length.  If no key is
supplied the user will be requested to supply one.  The key may be
obtained from a deckfile.list and can be inputted as either a complete
or partial key.  If a partial key is supplied the user is queried for
each match of the given key.
