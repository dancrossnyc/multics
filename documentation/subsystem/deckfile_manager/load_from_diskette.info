12/03/86  load_from_diskette, lfd

Syntax as a command:  lfd {-mca mca_id} {diskette_type1.....N or -all}
   {-control_args}


Function:  loads MCA diskettes into a tandd_deck_file.  See "notes on
diskettes" below.


Arguments:
-mca <mca_id>
   specifies the MCA to be used for reading diskettes.  Where <mca_id>
   is a value between a-d and is equal to the designation of the IMU.
diskette_type1...N
   label(s) of diskette(s) to be read.


Control arguments:
-all -a
   load all know MCA diskettes into the tandd_deck_file.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages from deckfile_manager specifing the
   deckfile.list and tandd_deck_file that will be used for this
   request.
-deckfile deckfile_path, -df deckfile_path
   specifies that the deckfile_path is the target tandd_deck_file to be
   used for this request.


Notes:  If a required argument or information is missing the user is
queried for the required information.



Notes on deckfile_path:  If the deckfile_path is not given on the
request line then the following sequence is used.  If a deckfile_path
is entered in the deckfile_manager command line, it is used.  Otherwise
the current working_dir is searched for an entry, if one is found the
user is notified of its use.  If an entry is not found and the user has
sufficient effective access, the user is queried as to the creation of
the tandd_deck_file or deckfile.list.  If the reply is no and the user
has sufficient effective access to modify the tandd_deck_file in
>system_library_tandd, the user is again query as to its usage.  If no
tandd_deck_file is found the command is aborted.



Notes on diskettes:  A list of required diskettes or -all (-a) may be
requested.  A list of known valid diskettes may be obtained by the
list_diskette_types (ldt) request.
