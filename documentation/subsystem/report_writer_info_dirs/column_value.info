09/10/85  column_value, clv

Syntax as an active request:  [clv column_id {-control_args}]


Function:  This request returns the value of the specified column for
the current row, previous row, or next row.  It can only be used as an
active request.  It is used within a formatted report produced by the
display request to obtain the value of a column.  It is an error to use
this request anywhere except in a header/footer or editing string
within a report produced by the display request.


Arguments:
column_id
   specifies which column value is to be returned.  It can be given as
   the name of the column or the number of the column as selected
   through the subsystem.


Control arguments:
-current_row, -crw
   returns the value of the named column for the current row.
   (Default)
-default STR
   returns the character string STR when there is no previous row, or
   when there is no next row.  (Default value for STR is "" if this
   control argument is not provided.)
-next_row, -nrw
   returns the value of the named column for the next row.  If there is
   no next row, the string "" is returned unless changed by the
   -default control argument.
-previous_row, -prw
   returns the value of the named column for the previous row.  If
   there is no previous row, the string "" is returned unless changed
   by the -default control argument.


Notes:  When a subtotal is being generated, the column_value request
returns the value of the subtotal, rather than the value of the column.
An editing string for a column like "[pic $99v.99 [clv salary]]", would
edit the value of the salary column through the picture active request
for every row.  When a subtotal is being generated, the value of the
salary subtotal is edited through the picture active request.  This
behavior also applies to subcounts, counts, and totals, in addition to
subtotals.


Examples:
   [clv foo]
   [clv 3]
   [clv foo -previous_row]
   [clv foo -next_row -default NULL]
