09/10/85  display, di

Syntax:  di {-control_largs}


Function:  This request retrieves selected data, creates a report, and
displays it on the terminal or sends it to a file or an io switch.


Arguments:
-all, -a
   displays all pages of the report.  This argument is incompatible
   with the -pages control argument.  (Default)
-brief, -bf
   suppresses warning messages.
-character_positions STR1 {STR2}, -chpsn STR1 {STR2}
   where STR1 and STR2 define the left and right character positions of
   a vertical section of the report.  STR1 must be given and defines
   the left margin position to begin from.  STR2 is optional, and if
   not given, defaults to the rightmost character position of the
   report.  If this control argument is not given, the entire page is
   displayed.


-discard_report, -dsrp
   deletes the report on termination.  (Default)
-discard_retrieval, -dsr
   deletes retrieved data on termination.  (Default)


-enable_escape_keys, -eek
   specifies the use of escape key sequences, rather than the function
   keys and arrow keys on the terminal, for scrolling functions.  This
   is the default if the -scroll control argument is given and the
   terminal does not have the necessary set of function keys and arrow
   keys (see -enable_function_keys).  (In the following description,
   the mnemonic "esc-" means the escape key on the terminal.)  The
   following escape key sequences are used if this control argument is
   given, or the terminal lacks the necessary set of keys:

      FUNCTION NAME             KEY SEQUENCE

      forward                   esc-f
      backward                  esc-b
      left                      esc-l
      right                     esc-r
      help                      esc-?
      set_key                   esc-k
      set_scroll_increment      esc-i
      quit                      esc-q
      redisplay                 esc-d
      start_of_report           esc-s
      end_of_report             esc-e
      multics_mode              esc-m
      goto                      esc-g


-enable_function_keys, -efk
   specifies the use of terminal function keys and arrow keys for
   scrolling functions.  This is the default when the -scroll control
   argument is given and the terminal has at least nine function keys
   and four arrow keys.  (In the following description, the mnemonic fN
   means function key N, where N is the number of the function key.
   The mnemonic down_arrow means the down arrow key, up_arrow means the
   up arrow key, left_arrow means the left arrow key, and right_arrow
   means the right arrow key.  The following key sequences are used if
   this control argument is given and the terminal has the necessary
   set of keys:

      FUNCTION NAME             KEY SEQUENCE

      forward                   down_arrow
      backward                  up_arrow
      left                      left_arrow
      right                     right_arrow
      help                      f1 (function key)
      set_key                   f2
      set_scroll_increment      f3
      quit                      f4
      redisplay                 f5
      start_of_report           f6
      end_of_report             f7
      multics_mode              f8
      goto                      f9


-extend
   appends the report to an existing file rather than replacing it if
   the -output_file control argument is used.  (Default is to truncate
   an existing file if this control argument is not provided.)
-keep_report, -krp
   keeps the report on termination.  This control argument is necessary
   in order to use -old_report on subsequent invocations of display.
-keep_retrieval, -kr
   keeps retrieved data to allow re-use on subsequent invocations of
   the display request.  Previously retrieved sorted data retains the
   sort order.
-long, -lg
   displays warning messages when a control argument such as
   -old_retrieval is used and the data from a previous retrieval is not
   available.  (Default)


-new_report, -nrp
   creates a new report.  (Default)
-new_retrieval, -nr
   begins a new retrieval.  (Default)
-old_report, -orp
   uses the report created in the previous invocation.  Use of this
   control argument requires that -keep_report be used in the prior
   invocation of display.
-old_retrieval, -or
   uses data retrieved during the previous invocation.  Use of this
   control argument requires that -keep_retrieval be used in the prior
   invocation of display.


-output_file path, -of path
   where path is the name of the file which contains the formatted
   report.  If this control argument or -output_switch is not given,
   the report is displayed on the terminal.  This argument is
   incompatible with the -output_switch control argument.
-output_switch switch_name, -osw switch_name
   where switch_name is the name of a switch to be used to display the
   report.  If this control argument or -output_file is not given, the
   report is displayed on the terminal.  It is an error to use this
   control argument if the named switch is not already open and
   attached when display is invoked.  This argument is incompatible
   with the -output_file control argument.


-page STR, -pg STR; -pages STR, -pgs STR
   where STR is a blank-separated list of pages (N N) or
   comma-separated page ranges where STR is a blank-separated list of
   pages (N N) or comma-separated page ranges (N,N).  Page ranges can
   also be given as N, or "N,$" which means from page N to the end of
   the report, or simply $ which means the last page.  This argument is
   incompatible with the -all control argument.
-passes N, -pass N
   where N is the number of times the report is to be formatted.  No
   output is produced until the last formatting pass of the report.
   (Default value for N is 1)


-scroll
   specifies scrolling the report according to key sequences read from
   the terminal.  Only terminals supported by the Multics video system
   can use the scrolling feature.  If the -window control argument is
   not used, the -scroll argument creates a uniquely named window for
   the display of the report.  The user_i/o window is reduced to four
   lines and the remaining lines are used for the uniquely named report
   display window.  The minimum size for this window is five lines, so
   the user_i/o window must be at least nine lines before invoking
   display, unless the -window control argument is used.


-set_key STR, -sk STR; -set_keys STR, -sks STR
   specifies that the named scrolling functions are to be set to the
   provided key sequences.  STR is a blank-separated list of one or
   more scrolling function names and key sequences, given as:

      function_name key_sequence ... {function_name  key-sequence}

   The function names can be chosen from the set described under
   -enable_escape_keys or -enable_function_keys control arguments.  The
   key sequences can be given as the actual sequences or mnemonic key
   sequences.  The provided mnemonics can be:

       fN                    where N is the number of the desired
                             function key
       esc- or escape-       corresponds to the escape character
       ctl-x or control-x    corresponds to the character sequence
                             generated when the control key is held
                             while also pressing the character named
                             by "x"
       down_arrow            corresponds to the up arrow key
       up_arrow              corresponds to the up arrow key
       left_arrow            corresponds to the right arrow key
       home                  corresponds to the home key


-sort STRs {-ascending | -descending} {-case_sensitive|
         -non_case_sensitive), -sort STRs {asc | -dsc} -cs | -ncs}
   where STRs are the names of columms or numbers corresponding to the
   position of the columns as selected through the subsystem.  It can
   be followed by -ascending or -descending, and -case_sensitive or
   -non_case_sensitive.  (Default is -ascending and -case_sensitive.)
-temp_dir dir_name, -td dir_name
   specifies that the given directory be used for storing the retrieved
   data, saving the report if -keep_report is used, and sorting
   workspace if -sort is used instead of the process directory.  This
   temporary directory continues to be used until another new temporary
   directory is requested.  A new temporary directory can only be
   specified when a new retrieval and new report are requested.


-truncate, -tc
   replaces the contents of the existing file if the -output_file
   control argument is used.  (Default is to truncate if the -extend
   control argument is not provided.,
-window STR, -win STR
   specifies that the window named by STR be used for the display of
   the report.  This argument is only meaningful when the -scroll
   argument is also used.  If this control argument is used, the window
   named by STR must be attached and open under the video system, and
   it must be at least five lines high.


Examples:
    di
    di -output_file foo
    di -keep_retrieval -sort bar -descending -non_case_sensitive
    di -keep_retrieval -keep_report -of foo1 -character_positions 1 132
    di -old_retrieval -old_report -of foo2 -character_positions 133 260
    di -pages 1 3 12,19 58,$ -output_switch foo
    di -sort foo -descending bar -non_case_sensitive
