:Info:  Introduction:

The Executive Forum system works with menus.  The menu options refer to
explanations of certain basic parts of Executive Forum.  To get one of
these explanations, just type the number of the menu option you want --
there is NO need to press the RETURN key (or the equivalent of carriage
return on your terminal).  You should start by going through all the
options in this menu.  To begin attending forum meetings, select the
option to display the "Executive Forum" menu.


:Info:  Getting_To_Know_Your_Terminal:  Getting To Know Your Terminal

Your terminal has basically two parts, the screen and the keyboard.
The screen looks much like a television, which is divided into three
parts.  The upper portion contains the menus you work from and status
information, or a comment if you are replying to a comment.  The middle
portion displays explanations like this one, lists of various kinds,
and comments made by you and others in meetings.  The bottom portion is
a one or two line help display with instructions on how to invoke
general functions associated with the current activity.

On your screen you will see a light that moves around.  As this
explanation was being displayed, this light moved ahead of each
character as it was displayed.  This light is in the form of a box or a
little line that moves under the lines of text.  This light is called
the "cursor," and it marks your current position on the screen.  When
it is in the menu portion of the screen, you can select one of the menu
options.  When it is in the lower portion of the screen, it marks the
place where anything you type will be displayed.

The keyboard is much like the keyboard on a typewriter, except that
there are a few extra keys.  The terminal keyboard, like standard
electric typewriter keyboards, has a carriage return key.  On some
keyboards it is labelled RETURN, on others CARRIAGE RETURN or CR, and
on yet other keyboards it is labelled ENTER.

One of the extra keys is the BREAK (or "BRK") key.  It is often colored
red because it is a kind of alarm key that you press to signal Multics
to stop immediately and return the cursor to the menu.

Most, but not all terminals have a series of extra keys called function
keys.  These are usually located along the top of your keyboard and are
labelled F1, F2, etc.  These keys work in Executive Forum only when the
cursor is in the menu portion of the screen.  They perform special
functions in Executive Forum.  Their functions are usually displayed at
the bottom of the screen when they are applicable.

If your keyboard does not have function keys, you can perform the
function key operations by using the key marked "ESC" in combination
with other keys (e.g., "ESC q").  Anytime you want to operate the "ESC"
key, press and release it quickly, and then type the key you are using
in combination with it.

The last extra key you must learn is the one labelled "CTL".  Like the
ESC key, it is used in combination with other keys.  Unlike the ESC
key, the CTL key must be held down while typing the key to be used in
combination with it.


:Info:  How_To_Exit_Executive_Forum:  How To Exit Executive Forum

When you are ready to stop attending meetings in Executive Forum, press
function key F4 (or "ESC q" if your terminal does not have function
keys).  Before you execute this, be sure the cursor is in the menu
portion of the screen.  Otherwise, pressing F4 (or "ESC q") has no
effect.

If the cursor is not in the top menu, you must move it back before you
can get out of Executive Forum.  This can be done in several ways.  You
can finish what you are doing in the bottom portion of the screen, or
you can press the BREAK (or "BRK") key, which aborts whatever you are
doing in the bottom portion of the screen and returns the cursor to the
top menu.


:Info:  How_To_Get_Help:  How To Get Help

The menu now displayed at the top of your screen provides the first
stage of help with Executive Forum.  It is the first menu you see when
entering Executive Forum for the first time, although after this
session, the first menu seen upon reentering is the one titled
"Executive Forum."  One of the options in that menu enables you to
select the Getting Started menu, the one now being used, if you wish to
go through any part of it again.

When you are not working with the Getting Started menu, you can get
help in four ways.  The first is to use function key F1 (or "ESC ?"  if
you are not using function keys).  You can use the F1 key whenever the
cursor is in the menu at the top of the screen.  After pressing it, you
will be asked what specifically you want help with.  If you want to
know what one of the options in the menu does, type its number or
letter, but do NOT press RETURN, and the explanation is displayed below
the menu.  To get an explanation of one of the function keys, press
that function key, (again, do NOT press RETURN).

If you inadvertently press RETURN when it is not called for, the system
responds with a beep to notify you that an unexpected action occurred.
Furthermore, if you inadvertently press RETURN while the system is
displaying, or getting ready to display a message, and the message
requires more than one screen to display, then you may find that some
data is lost (scrolled off the top of the screen).  In this case, you
would have to request the information a second time.

If you are using escape sequences instead of function keys, type the
two character escape sequence (ESC followed by another character) that
is used in place of the particular function key you want (as mentioned
above, do NOT press RETURN).  Finally, if you want to know about
something other than a menu option or a function key, how to correct
mistakes for example, you can respond to the request for the specific
help desired by typing two question marks (??).  That will get you a
menu containing general information items from which you can choose the
specific explanation you need.

The second way of getting help is used when your cursor is not in the
menu at the top of the screen.  Whenever you are asked to supply
information for an operation within a menu, you can type a single
question mark (?)  followed by RETURN to get an explanation of exactly
what it is you are being asked for.

Whenever you are asked to supply the name or number of some item from a
list of names, meetings, or comments, you can display the list as a
menu by typing two question marks (??)  followed by RETURN.  You can
then select an item from that menu by typing the number or letter
assigned to it, just as you select an option from a menu.

Finally, help is available in the form of brief reminders at the bottom
of the screen.  The bottom line always displays keystrokes that can be
used for certain functions that are relevant to the menu currently
displayed.


:Info:  Responding_To_Prompts:  Responding To Prompts

A "prompt" is a system question (or request) for more information.
When you select a menu option, the Executive Forum facility often
replies with a prompt to ask you more specifically what you want to do.
If, for instance, you were selecting a comment in a meeting, you would
supply a number.

Anytime you are prompted for a response while using Executive Forum,
you can type a question mark (?)  followed by RETURN to get an
explanation of what you are being asked for.

If your terminal is missing a key, check the documentation for the
terminal emulator you are using to find the key or key sequence which
maps to the missing key.  For example, some keyboards do not have the
DEL key which is used to discard info in response to the "MORE?"
prompt.  You would have to check the documentation and see which key or
keys is equal to the "pad" character, ASCII 177.

If you are asked to provide a number or name from an undisplayed list,
you can display a menu by responding with two question marks (??)
followed by RETURN.

If you wish to correct a response to a prompt, you can use the same
keystrokes you use when editing a comment.  Since responses are made on
a single line, not all of the editing-comment controls are applicable.
Those that are, are listed below.  When using control keystrokes that
employ the CTL key, hold the CTL key down while typing the associated
character.  With keystrokes that use the ESC key, press and immediately
release the ESC key followed by the associated character key.  No space
is required after the CTL or ESC key and the associated character key.

CTL f     moves the cursor right one character.
ESC f     moves the cursor right one word.
CTL e     moves the cursor to the end of the line.
CTL a     moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
CTL b     moves the cursor left one character.
ESC b     moves the cursor left one word.
CTL d     deletes the one character the cursor is under or covering.
ESC d     deletes one word to the right of the cursor.
BACKSPACE deletes one character to the left of the cursor (the DEL key
          also does this).
ESC BACKSPACE deletes one word to the left of the cursor (ESC DEL also
          does this).
CTL k     erases all text between the cursor and the end of the line.
@         erases all text between the cursor and the beginning of the
          line.
CTL Y     retrieves any piece of erased text, longer than one
          character, and inserts it at the current cursor position.


:Info:  How_To_Correct_Typos:  How To Correct Typos

Typing mistakes are inevitable, so the Executive Forum system provides
a number of ways for you to change what was typed.

Whenever you are either typing a response to a prompt or entering
comments, you can move the cursor to different points in the text and
erase, change, or add to what was typed.  This is done with keystrokes
that use either the ESC or CTL key.  When using the CTL key, hold it
down while you type the associated character key.  When using the ESC
key, press and release it before typing the the associated character
key.

Listed below are the keystrokes that can be used, both in changing a
response to a prompt and when working in the comment editor.

CTL f     moves the cursor right one character.
ESC f     moves the cursor right one word.
CTL e     moves the cursor to the end of the line.
CTL a     moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
CTL b     moves the cursor left one character.
ESC b     moves the cursor left one word.
CTL d     deletes the one character the cursor is under or covering.
ESC d     deletes one word to the right of the cursor.
BACKSPACE deletes one character to the left of the cursor (the DEL key
          also does this).
ESC BACKSPACE deletes one word to the left of the cursor (ESC DEL also
          does this).
CTL k     erases all text between the cursor and the end of the line.
@         erases all text between the cursor and the beginning of the
          line.
CTL Y     retrieves any piece of erased text, longer than one
          character, and inserts it at the current cursor position.


:Info:  Getting_Around_The_Menus:  Getting Around The Menus

When you enter Executive Forum, the first menu displayed is the one
titled "Executive Forum" (except the very first time you use the
system, when the Getting Started menu is displayed).  The Executive
Forum menu lets you select meetings to attend; personalize certain
aspects of Executive Forum; and select the Getting Started menu.

The F3 function key is one of several function keys used for getting
around in Executive Forum.  F3 is used to display the previous menu at
the top the screen.  The F2 function key (or "ESC f") displays the
Executive Forum menu.

The F6 (or "ESC 1") and F7 (or "ESC h") function keys are used to
display, respectively, the next and the previous portions of a menu
that is being displayed in the bottom portion of the screen.  Usually,
the menus in the bottom portion of the screen are lists of names,
subjects, or comments that can be quite long, longer than can be
displayed on the screen at one time.

The BREAK (or "BRK") key can be used to return the cursor to the menu
at the top of the screen anytime you are working in the space beneath
that menu.


:Info:  The_2_Attending_Menus:  The 2 Attending Menus

There are two ways to read comments in meetings (by entry number or
subject) and each has a menu designed for its specific approach.  The
entry number menu for attending meetings treats each comment in the
meeting separately, so you select, read, and reply to comments by
number.  The subject oriented menu, by contrast, groups comments by
subject, so you select, read, and reply to comments by subject.  In the
latter menu, entry numbers are referred to, but almost all options in
the menu process comments according to subject groups.

You can choose which you want to use when attending meetings by
selecting the "Read Comments by Subject" option in the Personalize
Executive Forum menu.  The approach you choose is used for all meetings
you attend, though you can change the approach used whenever you wish.
If you make no choice, the entry subject-oriented approach is used.
(Default)


:Info:  What_Are_Eligible_Meetings:  What Are Eligible Meetings

Eligible meetings are meetings that you are eligible to attend.  All
meetings have lists of people or projects who are eligible to attend
them.  Some meetings are "public," which means that everyone can attend
them.  To be eligible for a meeting, you must have your name, or the
name of the project you work under, on the eligible list, or the
meeting must be public.


:Info:  What_Are_Attended_Meetings:  What Are Attended Meetings

Attended meetings are meetings that you have attended and have not
resigned from.  You can attend any eligible meeting, and once you
attend, that meeting is placed on your personal meeting list.  It
remains on that list until you remove it.


:Info:  What_Are_Changed_Meetings:  What Are Changed Meetings

A changed meeting is a meeting on your list of attended meetings that
contain comments that you have not yet read.


:Info:  What_Is_The_Current_Comment:  What Is The Current Comment

The current comment is the comment or group of comments that the menu
options operate on when they are selected.  The current comment or
comments is always indicated by a number or other specification
displayed near the top of the Attending Meeting menu, and there are
options in that menu that enable you to specify which comments are to
be current.


:Info:  Selecting_The_Current_Comment:  Selecting The Current Comment

Both Attending Meeting menus contain options that enable you to specify
which comment or comments is to be current.

The Attending Meeting menu that works with comments according to the
number by which they are listed in the meeting has the following
options available for selecting the current comment.  The "Select ...
Next Comment" option makes the next highest numbered comment in the
meeting the current one.  "Select ...  Next Unread Comment" option
makes the next highest comment that you have not yet read, the current
comment.  The "Select ...  Comment(s)" option is the most flexible
because it enables you to specify exactly which comment or group of
comments to make current.  You can specify comments by number or by
keyword.  Numbers for different comments must be separated by space
(e.g., 14 23 25).  To specify by keyword, you use one of the following
(short names are in parentheses):  all (a), first (f), last (l), new,
next (n), previous (p), highest, allref, (aref), firstref (fref),
lastref (lref), nextref (nref), priorref (pref), restref (rref), search
(s).

If you use the Attending Meeting menu that works with comments in a
meeting according to the subject they are grouped by, the following
options are available for selecting the current comment.  But unlike
the number-oriented menu, you can have only one current comment at a
time.  The "Next Subject with Unread Comments" option finds the first
comment in the list of comments that you have not yet read and makes
that comment and its subject current.  The "Select Subject" option
enables you to select another subject to be the current subject.
Finally, the "Select/Display Comment Number" option enables you to
select a current comment by number, rather than by subject.  Since only
one comment at a time can be current, you can select a comment only by
number.  Keywords cannot be used.


:Info:  Entering_Comments:  Entering Comments

You can enter comments in a meeting anytime you are attending that
meeting.  To do so you use the "Start New Discussion" and "Reply to
Current Comment" options in the Attending Meeting menu.  When you make
a comment with the "Start New Discussion" option, you are asked to
specify a subject for the comment.  When you comment using the "Reply
to Current Comment" option, the subject of your comment is
automatically the same as that of the so-called current comment.  The
 "current" comment is always indicated by number near the top of the
Attending Meeting menu.  It is the comment or group of comments that
the menu options operate on when they are selected.  There are options
in the Attending Meetings menu that enable you to specify which
comments are to be current.

When you select one of the options for making a comment, a text editor
is set up on your screen so that you can type in and edit your comment.
When you are finished and wish to enter the comment, type "ESC q".
This keystroke and others that are appropriate to typing and editing
are listed at the bottom of the screen for your convenience.


:Info:  Personalizing_The_System:  Personalizing The System

The Personalize Executive Forum menu lets you set several aspects of
Executive Forum to work the way you want them to.  First of all, you
can specify whether you want to read comments in meetings by subject or
by comment number.  You can also arrange to use escape sequences
instead of function keys, to display certain information in menu form,
to remove the menu from the upper portion of the screen while working
in the editor, and to have messages processed by your own message
handler.  Finally, you can arrange to go to Multics command level while
attending meetings in Executive Forum.


:Info:  Multics_Command_Level_Mode:  Multics Command Level Mode

You can arrange the Executive Forum system to let you leave the system
temporarily to go to Multics command level and then return to the place
from which you left.  This is done by selecting the "Multics Command
Mode" option in the Personalize Executive Forum meeting.  If you choose
to have this function available, it is connected to function key F8.
If you use escape sequences instead of function keys, command level
mode is activated by the "ESC e" sequence.


:Info: Changes_Between_Version_1_And_2: Changes Between Version 1 And 2

The principle changes between version 1.0 of Executive Forum
(distributed with Multics Release 11) and version 2.0 (distributed with
Multics Release 12) are the implementation of the subject oriented
"Attending Meeting" menu and the "Personalization" menu.  Refer to the
"The 2 Attending Menus" option of the "Getting Started" menu or
"General Help Topics" menu for an explanation of the subject oriented
"Attending Meeting" menu.  The "Personalizing The System" option of
those two menus contains an explanation of how to personalize Executive
Forum.  The control arguments that were used to control personalization
options are obsolete.  They still work in MR12 but their use will
result in a warning message.  The only control arguments that are not
obsolete are -force (-fc) and -no_force (-nfc).

Another major change is the ability to select a disjoint set of
comments while in the entry order "Attending Meeting" menu.  This may
be done by either enumerating the set in response to the "What
comment(s) do you wish to select" prompt (i.e., "6 28 496" or by
entering the keyword "search").  If "search" is entered you are
prompted for the text to search for.  If there are currently multiple
comments selected, then the search is applied ONLY to those comments.
If there is currently only one comment selected then all the comments
in the meeting are searched.  A "?"  response to either prompt provides
more help.

In order to improve selection from a "Choices" menu (i.e., the menu of
meeting names) the "ENTER NAME" option now appears as the last option
on each submenu instead of only on the last submenu.

The "General Help Topics" menu was moved from the bottom of the screen
to the top.

Finally, whenever you use a new version of Executive Forum you receive
a warning message.  In addition, an option on the "General Help Topics"
menu can be selected to describe the differences between the previous
version of Executive Forum and the current version.
