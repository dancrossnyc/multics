:Info:  F1:  F1 and ESC ?

Whenever the terminal cursor (the moving light that marks your place on
the screen) is in the upper portion of the screen (the menu), you can
get help by pressing function key F1 (or "ESC ?"  if you are using
escape sequences).  You are then asked what specific help you need.  If
you want help with an option in the above menu, type the number or
letter of that option but DO NOT press RETURN.  If you want help with a
function key, press that function key, (again do NOT press RETURN).  If
you are using escape sequences, type the two character sequence ("ESC"
followed by another character) that is used in place of the particular
function key you want.  Finally, if you want to know about something
other than a menu option or a function key you can respond to the
request for the specific help desired by typing two question marks
(??).  This provides a menu containing general information items that
you can choose from.

Function keys 1 through 8 (F1-F8) operate in Executive Forum, but if
your terminal does not have them, you should press the "ESC" key
followed by either ?, f, p, q, r, l, h, or e to get the functions.  You
may also elect to use the escape keys if you wish.  To do so, go to the
Personalize Executive Forum menu and choose the "Always Use Escape
Keys" option.

In brief, the function keys and escape keys operate as follows:

F1 (ESC ?)     provides help with menu options and other function keys.
F2 (ESC f)     returns you to the first menu, the one called Executive
               Forum.
F3 (ESC p)     returns you to the previous menu.
F4 (ESC q)     gets you out of the Executive Forum facility.
F5 (ESC r)     causes the menu and anything else on the screen to be
               redisplayed.
F6 (ESC l)     enables you to look at the portion of a long menu that
               has scrolled off the top of your screen.
F7 (ESC h)     enables you to look at the portion of a long menu that
               is in the next screen, coming up from the bottom of your
               terminal.
F8 (ESC e)     enables you to execute a Multics command while working
               in Executive Forum.  In order to use this key or
               sequence, you must set the personalize forum option
               "Multics Command Mode" to yes.

Pressing this function key or its associated escape sequence causes the

(at the bottom of your screen) to be redisplayed.  If there is a
"Choices" menu below the top menu, it also is redisplayed.  Any text
below the top menu (i.e., a meeting comment or Executive Forum message)
is cleared from the screen.  This is useful when your screen gets
messed up unexpectedly.


:Info:  F6:  F6 and ESC l

Pressing this function key or its associated escape sequence enables
you to look at the portion of a long menu that has scrolled off the top
of your screen.  This key can only be used when you are reading a menu
displayed by typing two question marks (??).


:Info:  F7:  F7 and ESC h

Pressing this function key or its associated escape sequence enables
you to look at the portion of a long menu that is in the next screen,
coming up from the bottom of your terminal.  This key can only be used
when you are reading a menu displayed by typing two question marks (??)
and you want to move ahead quickly to a later part of the list.


:Info:  F8:  F8 and ESC e

Pressing this function key or its associated escape sequence enables
you to execute a Multics command.  You are prompted for the command to
be executed.  You must press the RETURN key after you finish typing the
command.  The menu and existing text displayed below the menu are
scrolled off the screen as space is needed to display the output
produced by the command.  After the command completes, you are prompted
for another command.  To return to the menu press the RETURN key
without entering a command.

In order to use this function key or escape sequence, you must first
activate it by using the "Multics Command Mode" option in the
Personalize Executive Forum menu.  Once you do that, you will be able
to use this function key or escape sequence anytime you are in the
Executive Forum facility.
