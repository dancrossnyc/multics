07/23/75 edm

Function: creates or edits ASCII segments.


Syntax: edm {path}


Arguments:  path is the pathname of the segment to be edited.


Modes: edm has three modes-- input, edit, and comment.
If path was specified and found, edm begins in edit mode;
otherwise it begins in input mode.

In edit mode, edm accepts and performs edit requests.

In input mode, all lines typed are appended to the file until a
line consisting of "." is typed, causing return to edit mode.

In comment mode, one line at a time of the file is printed without
carriage return, and the user may append to the end of the line
by typing a continuation, or may type a "." to cause a return to
edit mode.


Requests: in edit mode the following are valid.
.  enter input mode; exit when a line with only "." is typed
- N  back up N lines
,  enter "comment" mode; exit when a line with only "." is typed
=  print current line number
b  go to bottom of file, enter input mode
c N /s1/s2/  change all occurrences of string "s1" to "s2" for N lines
d N  delete N lines
updelete  delete all lines above current line
E line  execute "line" as a Multics command line
f string  find a line beginning with "string"
i line  insert "line" after current line


merge path  insert segment "path" after current line
move M N  beginning with line M, remove N lines and insert
          them after the current line.
k  enter brief mode (no response after f, n, l, c, s)
l string  locate a line containing "string"
n N  move down N lines
p N  print N lines
q  exit from edm (See Notes)
qf exit directly from edm with no question
r line  replace current line with "line"
s N /s1/s2/  same as "c"
t  go to top of file
v  enter verbose mode (opposite of "k")
w path  write edited copy of file into "path" (See Notes)
upwrite path  write and delete all lines above current line into "path"


Notes:
For the "s" and "c" requests, the delimiter may be any character
not in the strings s1 and s2; c/a/b/ and cxaxbx work the same.
If the first string is empty, characters go in at the front.


For the "q" request, if a "w" has not been done since the last
change to the text then edm warns the user that changes
made may be lost and asks whether the user still
wishes to exit. If no changes have been made since
the last "w" then the user exits directly.
The "qf" request bypasses this check.
