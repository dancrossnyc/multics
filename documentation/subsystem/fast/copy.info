03/05/76 copy, cp

Function:  copies segments into the working directory.


Syntax:  cp path1A path2A ... path1N {path2N} {-control_arg}


Arguments:
path1i  is the pathname of a segment; star convention can be used.

path2i   is the pathname of copy created from path1i; if omitted,
copy is given the entryname of path1N.


Control arguments:  -name (-nm) copies multiple names.


Notes:Special action is taken if the name of the segment being copied
already exists in the working directory.  If the entry being
copied has an alternate name, the entryname that would have
resulted in a duplicate name is removed and the user is informed
of this action; the copying operation then takes place.  If the entry
being copied has only one entryname, the entry that already exists
in the directory must be deleted to remove the name.  The user is
asked if the deletion should be done; if the user answers "no", the
copying operation does not take place.
