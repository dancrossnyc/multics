02/27/76   acl_matching

The strategy for matching an access control name argument is defined
by three rules:

A literal component, including "*", matches only a component of
the same name.

A missing component not delimited by a period is treated the same
as a literal "*" (e.g., "*.Multics" is treated as "*.Multics.*").  
Missing components on the left must be delimited by periods.

A missing component delimited by a period matches any component.


Examples:

*.*.*     matches only the literal ACL entry "*.*.*".
Multics   matches only the ACL entry "Multics.*.*".
          (The absence of a leading period makes Multics the
           first component.)
JRSmith.. matches any ACL entry with a first component of
          JRSmith.
..        matches any ACL entry.
.         matches any ACL entry with a last component of *.
""        (null string) matches any ACL entry ending in ".*.*".
