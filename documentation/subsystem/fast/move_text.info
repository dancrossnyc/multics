03/10/76 move_text, mt

Function:  relocates and resequences one or more lines of temporary text.
See Notes.


Syntax:  mt first_line {last_line} ,line_number


Arguments:
first_line   line number of first line to be moved.

last_line   line number of last line to be moved; if omitted, only
line specified by first_line is moved.

,line_number   line number after which moved lines are inserted.
This line number must be preceded by a comma.


Notes:
If new line numbers cause duplication of existing line numbers, enough
lines are resequenced to ensure no overlap.

Special editing is done for BASIC source text, i.e., references
to lines that are renumbered are edited to reflect the new numbers.

The first_line and last_line do not have to appear in the text, but 
the range specified by them must contain at least one line.
