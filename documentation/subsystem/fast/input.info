03/09/76 input

Function:  provides a convenient way to enter numbered lines. See Notes.


Syntax:  input {new_number} {increment}


Arguments:
new_number   number of the first new line; if omitted, lines are
entered at the end of the temporary text.

increment   increment of subsequent line numbers (default is 10).


Notes:
When this command is invoked, the system types the line number and one
space.  The user completes the line.  This input mode is terminated when
the user types a newline character without having typed any other
character on the line.


If the number given with the input command or a number generated by
the input request already exists or would cause the temporary text
to be out of sequence, an error message is printed and the user
is returned to command level.
