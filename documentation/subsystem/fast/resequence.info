03/10/76 resequence, rsq

Function:  renumbers specified lines of temporary text or a
saved segment.  See Notes.


Syntax:  resequence {path} {-control_arg} {new_number} {increment}


Arguments:
path   pathname of segment to be resequenced; if omitted, the
temporary text is used.

new_number   first new line number assigned (default is 100).

increment   increment used to derive subsequent line numbers
(default is 10).


Control arguments: -pathname path, -pn path specifies that path

Notes:  This command does special editing for BASIC source text,
i.e., references to lines that are renumbered are changed to correspond  
to the new line numbers.  In all other cases, only line numbers at the
beginning of the line are changed.
