03/10/76 merge_text, mgt

Function:  inserts contents of a segment into the temporary text. See
Notes.


Syntax:  merge_text path {line_number}


Arguments:
path   pathname of segment to be inserted; this segment must have 
line numbers.

line_number   line number after which the segment is inserted.
If omitted, segment is inserted at the end of the temporary text.



Notes:  Inserted text is resequenced so that new text does not
duplicate existing line numbers.  Special editing is done for
BASIC source text, i.e. references to lines that are
renumbered are edited to reflect the new numbers.
