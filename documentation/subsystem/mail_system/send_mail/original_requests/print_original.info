10/20/83  send_mail request:  print_original, pro

Syntax:  pro {message_specifiers} {-selection_args} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the messages being answered by this invocation of
send_mail.


Arguments:
message_specifiers
   identifies which messages are to be printed.  If no
   message_specifiers and no selection_args are specified, the messages
   being answered by this invocation of send_mail are printed.  For
   more information on message specifiers, type:
         help message_specifiers.gi


Control arguments:
-long_header, -lghe
   specifies that the print_original request is to display all
   information from the message header including network tracing
   information even if some of the information is redundant.  (Ie: if
   the From, Sender, and Delivery-By fields are all equal, this option
   will force the print_original request to display all three fields
   when it prints the message).
-header, -he
   specifies that the print_original request is to display all
   information from the message header including user-defined fields
   while excluding the message trace and redundant information.  This
   is the default unless a different default was specified on the
   read_mail command line.


-brief_header, -bfhe
   specifies that the print_original request is to display the minimal
   amount of information from the message header.  The date and authors
   are always displayed; the subject is displayed if it isn't blank;
   the number of recipients is displayed either if there is more than
   one recipient or the user is not the sole recipient of the message;
   if the message was ever forwarded with comments, these comments will
   be displayed.
-no_header, -nhe
   specifies that the print_original request is to display absolutely
   no information from the message header.  Only the message number,
   message body line count, and message body will be displayed.


-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when processing message_specifiers and selection_args to
   determine which messages will be printed.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)


-reverse, -rv
   prints the messages in descending numeric order.
-no_reverse, -nrv
   prints the messages in ascending numeric order.  (Default)
