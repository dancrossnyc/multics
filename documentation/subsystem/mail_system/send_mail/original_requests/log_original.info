Notes:
Any message in the read_mail invocation in which the reply request
that created this send_mail was issued may be listed by this request.

The user's logbox is the mailbox --
      >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
which will be created automatically by this request if it does not
already exist.  The user will be informed when the logbox is created.

This request will acknowledge any messages requiring acknowledgement
unless -no_acknowledge is specified on the read_mail command line.
