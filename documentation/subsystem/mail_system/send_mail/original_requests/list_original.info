Notes:
Any message in the read_mail invocation in which the reply request
that created this send_mail was issued may be listed by this request.


Notes on listing format:
One line is printed for each message.  Its format is:

   N      (L)  MM/DD/YY HH:MM  AUTHOR		SUBJECT

where N is the message number and L is the number of lines in the body
of the message.  MM/DD/YY HH:MM is the date/time when the message was
created.  AUTHOR is that part of the first author's name which will fit
in the space provided; if the first author does not have a name, the
printed representation of his address is used instead; the authors of a
message are listed in the From field.  SUBJECT is that part of the
message's subject which will fit on the remainder of the line; if the
message is an interactive message and does not have a subject, the
actual text of the message is used instead.


If this is the current message, an asterik (*) is placed immediately
after the message number.  If "-idl" or "-odl" is specified and this
message has been marked for deletion, an exclamation point (!) is
placed immediately after the message number.

If this message requests an acknowledgement and one has not yet been
delivered, an "A" is placed after the message number.

If this message can not be deleted becauses its access class is not
equal to the user's process authorization, an ampersand (&) is placed
after the message number.

If this message was forwarded by one of its recipients to the mailbox
being exmained, an "F" is placed immediately after the line count.
