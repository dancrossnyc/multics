Syntax:  prohe {message_specifiers} {-selection_args} {-control_args}


Function:  prints the message headers of the messages being answered by
this invocation of send_mail.


Arguments:
message_specifiers
   identifies which message headers are to be printed.  If no
   message_specifiers and no selection_args are specified, the headers
   of the messages being answered by this send_mail are printed.  For
   more information on message specifiers, type:
         help message_specifiers.gi


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   specifies that the print_original_header request is to display all
   information from the message header including network tracing
   information even if some of the information is redundant.  (Ie: if
   the From, Sender, and Delivery-By fields are all equal, this option
   will force the print_original_header request to display all three
   fields).

   authors are always displayed; the subject is displayed if it isn't
   blank; the number of recipients is displayed either if there is more
   than one recipient or the user is not the sole recipient of the
   message; if the message was ever forwarded with comments, these
   comments will be displayed.


-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when processing message_specifiers and selection_args to
   determine which message headers will be printed.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)
