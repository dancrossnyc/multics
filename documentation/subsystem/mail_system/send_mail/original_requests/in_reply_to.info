10/20/83  send_mail request:  in_reply_to, irt

Syntax:  irt {message_specifiers} {-control_arg}


Function:  when given no arguments, displays the list of messages being
answered by this send_mail (the In-Reply-To field); when given
arguments, replaces said list with a new set.


Arguments:
message_specifiers
   identifies the messages which are to become the new list of messages
   being answered by this send_mail.  Use of message specifiers is
   incompatible with the -default control argument.  For more
   information on message specifiers, type:
         help message_specifiers.gi


Control arguments:
-default, -dft
   specifies that the list of messages being answered should be reset
   to the list supplied by the reply request when this send_mail
   invocation was created.  The list_original request may be used to
   display the contents of this default list.   Use of this control
   argument is incompatible with the use of message specifiers.
-no_default, -ndft
   specifies that the list of messages should not be reset to the list
   supplied by the reply request.  (This control argument is intended
   for use with abbreviations).


-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when processing the message_specifiers to determine which
   messages will be included in the new list of messages being
   answered.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)


Notes:
Use of this request to change the list of messages being answered does
not change the default set of messages processed by the other original
requests (print_original, etc).
