09/21/82  send_mail request:  from

Syntax:  from {addresses}


Function:  adds addresses to the list of authors of the message or
prints the contents of the list.


Arguments:
addresses
   are the addresses to add to the list of authors.  Type:
         help addresses.gi
   for a description of the syntax of addresses.  If no addresses are
   given, this request prints the list of authors.


Notes:
If no explicit authors are specified for the message either via this
request or via use of the -from control argument on the send_mail
command line, the user of send_mail will be listed as the sole author
of the message when it is transmitted.

If a message has more than one author or the author is not the user
using send_mail, a Sender field identifying the user of send_mail will
be added to the message when it is transmitted.
