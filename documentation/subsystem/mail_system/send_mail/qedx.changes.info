10/21/83  Changes to the send_mail qedx request

Several important, incompatible changes have been made to send_mail's
qedx request in MR10.2.


Auto-writing disabled by default:
In prior releases, the quit (q) request would automatically reflect any
changes made to the message back to send_mail.  In MR10.2, however, the
quit request no longer does this automatic update by default.  Two new
control arguments -- -auto_write and -no_auto_write (the default) --
are available for the send_mail command and the qedx request to change
this behavior for all invocations of qedx or for a single invocation of
qedx, respectively.

If -auto_write is in effect, the quit request will automatically
reflect any changes made to the message back to send_mail as in prior
releases.  When -no_auto_write (the defualt) is in effect, the
write (w) request must be used to reflect any changes back to
send_mail.  In eihter case, the write request may be used as often as
desired to checkpoint the editing process.


If the quit request is issued with -no_auto_write in effect and the
message has been modified since it was last written, qedx will query
for permission to exit.  If permission is given, any changes to the
message since the last write request (if any) will be lost.  The new
quit-force (qf) request may be used to abort unwanted editing of the
message without being queried.


Pathnames in the read (r) and write (w) requests:
As in prior releases, the read (r) request can be used to insert a
segment into the message and the write (w) request can be used to save
a copy of the message in a segment for later use.

In MR10.2, however, use of the read and write requests with a pathname
will not change the default pathname of buffer 0 (the message).  Using
either read or write without a pathname will always refer to
send_mail's copy of the message.


Use of 1,$dr:
In prior releases, the request line

     1,$dr

would always restore the original message text to the buffer.

In MR10.2, however, this request line will only restore the original
text if given before a write request.  If given after a write request,
this request line will restore the message text as saved by the last
write request given in the buffer.


New quit-force request:
As mentioned above, a new quit-force request is now available within
send_mail's qedx editor.  The description of quit-force as given in the
Multics qedx info segment follows--

quit force (qf) (Q)
   qf exits the editor without checking for modified buffers.  If any
      modified buffers are present, all changes made to those buffers
      since they were last written will be lost.
