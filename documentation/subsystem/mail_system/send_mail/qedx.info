10/21/83  send_mail request:  qedx, qx

Syntax:  qx {-control_args}


Function:  invokes the Multics qedx editor to edit the message text
and, optionally, the message header.


Control arguments:
-auto_write
   specifies that this request will automatically update the message
   when the user quits the editor.
-no_auto_write
   specifies that this request will require the user to use the write
   request to update the message before quitting the editor.  Any
   attempt to exit without writing will result in a query.
-fill, -fi
   specifies that the message text should be reformatted after editing.
-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the message text should not be reformatted.


-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length to use when reformatting the message text.
   If this control argument is not given, the line length specified on
   the send_mail command line will be used; if, however, no line length
   was specified on the send_mail command line, a line length of 72
   will be used.
-header, -he
   specifies that the message header is to be edited in addition to the
   message text.
-no_header, -nhe
   specifies that only the message text should be edited.  (Default)


Notes:
The default for reformatting the message after editing is dependent on
the original source of the message text.  If terminal input was used,
the default is to reformat the message; if file input was used, the
default is to not reformat the message.  This default may be changed by
use of the -fill and -no_fill control arguments on the send_mail
command line.  Additionally, whatever default is specified may be
overriden for one invocation of the qedx request by use of the control
arguments described above.


For compatibilty with the qedx command, the behavior described above
for -no_auto_write is the default mode of operation for this request.
This default may be changed by use of the -auto_write and
-no_auto_write control arguments on the send_mail command line.
Additionally, whatever default is specified may be overidden for one
invocation of the qedx request by the use of these control arguments on
the qedx request line.

The message text (and header if requested) are placed in buffer 0.  If
-auto_write is in effect, the quit (q) request will automatically
reflect any changes made to the message back to send_mail.  When
-no_auto_write is in effect, the write (w) request must be used to
reflect any changes back to send_mail.  In either case, the write
request may be used as often as desired to checkpoint the editing
process.


If the quit (q) request is issued with -no_auto_write in effect and the
message has been modified since it was last written, qedx will query
for permission to exit.  If permission is given, any changes to the
message since the last write request (if any) will be lost.  The
quit-force (qf) request may be used to abort unwanted editing of the
message without being queried.

The read (r) and write (w) requests will accept pathnames when used in
buffer 0 (the message) but they will never change the default pathname
of the buffer.  Thus, when used without a pathname, read and write will
always refer to send_mail's copy of the message.  When used with a
pathname, the read request will insert a segment into the message and
the write request will make a copy of the message in a segment for
later use.


If issued before use of the write request, the request line
     1,$dr
will restore the original message text to the buffer.  If given after a
write request, this request line will restore the message text as saved
by the last write request given in the buffer.

If the -header control argument is specified, both the message header
and text will be given to the editor.  After editing is complete,
send_mail will analyze the new message and then update the message's
subject, lists of primary/secondary/"blind" recipients, authors, and
list of recipients for future replies.  For detailed information on the
content of the message header, type:
     help message_format.gi
