10/04/82  send_mail request:  fill, fi

Syntax:  fi {-control_args}


Function:  reformats the text of the message according to the fill-on
and align-left modes of compose.


Control arguments:
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length to use when reformatting the message text.
   If this control argument is not given, the line length specified on
   the send_mail command line will be used; if, however, no line length
   was specified on the send_mail command line, a line length of 72
   will be used.


Notes:
If the -fill control argument, which is the default for terminal input,
was specified on the send_mail command line, the message will be
reformatted after each use of the qedx and apply requests.  This
automatic reformatting can be overriden by use of the -no_fill control
arguments to these requests.
