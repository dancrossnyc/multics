10/21/83  send_mail request:  apply, ap

Syntax:  ap {-control_args} command_line


Function:  passes the message text and, optionally, the message header
to an arbitrary Multics command line which is then executed in order to
possibly edit the message.


Arguments:
command_line
   is the Multics command line to be executed.  See the Notes below for
   an explanation of how the message is supplied to the command line.


Control arguments:
-fill, -fi
   specifies that the message text should be reformatted after the
   command line has been executed.
-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the message text should not be reformatted.
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length to use when reformatting the message text.
   If this control argument is not given, the line length specified on
   the send_mail command line will be used; if, however, no line length
   was specified on the send_mail command line, a line length of 72
   will be used.
-header, -he
   specifies that the message header is to be passed to the command
   line in addition to the message text.
-no_header, -nhe
   specifies that only the message text is to be passed to the command
   line.  (Default)


Notes:
The supplied command line need not be enclosed in quotes.  However, if
there are (), [], or "'s in the command line which should be processed
by the Multics command processor, they should be enclosed in quotes to
prevent processing by send_mail's request processor.

The message is passed to the Multics command line by placing the
message text and header (if requested) into a temporary segment.  The
pathname of this segment is then appended to the command line which is
then executed.  The content of the segment after execution then
replaces the prior message text (and header).

This request may be used to edit the message with an editor other than
qedx.  For example, the request
      apply emacs
will invoke the Emacs text editor on the message text.


The default for reformatting the message after execution of the command
line is dependent on the original source of the message text.  If
terminal input was used, the default is to reformat the message; if
file input was used, the default is to not reformat the message.  This
default may be changed by use of the -fill and -no_fill control
arguments on the send_mail command line.  Additionally, whatever
default is specified may be overriden for one invocation of the apply
request by use of the control arguments described above.

If the -header control argument is specified, both the message header
and text will be passed to the command line.  After execution is
complete, send_mail will analyze the new message and then update the
message's subject, lists of primary/secondary/"blind" recipients,
authors, and list of recipients for future replies.  For detailed
information on the content of the message header, type:
     help message_format.gi
