10/21/83  send_mail request:  bcc

Syntax:  bcc {addresses}


Function:  adds addresses to the list of "blind" recipients of the
message or prints the contents of the list.


Arguments:
addresses
   are the addresses to add to the list of "blind" recipients.  Type:
         help addresses.gi -section control argument
   for a description of the syntax of addresses.  If no addresses are
   given, this request prints the list of "blind" recipients.


Notes:
If the send request is invoked without explicit addresses, send_mail
will transmit the message to all addresses given in the primary,
secondary, and "blind" recipient lists.

When the message is transmitted, the copy delivered to the primary and
secondary recipients will not list the "blind" recipients.  The copy
delivered to the "blind" recipients, however, will list all the "blind"
recipients.
