10/11/83  read_mail (forward) request:  apply, ap

Syntax:  ap {-control_args} command_line


Function:  passes the comment text to an arbitrary Multics command line
which is then executed in order to possibly edit the comment.


Arguments:
command_line
   is the Multics command line to be executed.  See the Notes below for
   an explanation of how the comment is supplied to the command line.


Control arguments:
-fill, -fi
   specifies that the comment text should be reformatted after the
   command line has been executed.
-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the comment text should not be reformatted.
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length to use when reformatting the comment text.
   If this control argument is not given, the line length specified on
   the forward request line will be used; if, however, no line length
   was specified on the forward request line, a line length of 62 will
   be used.


Notes:
The supplied command line need not be enclosed in quotes.  However, if
there are (), [], or "'s in the command line which should be processed
by the Multics command processor, they should be enclosed in quotes to
prevent processing by forward's request processor.

The comment is passed to the Multics command line by placing the
comment text into a temporary segment.  The pathname of this segment is
then appended to the command line which is then executed.  Thes content
of the segment after execution then replaces the prior comment text.

This request may be used to edit the comment with an editor other than
qedx.  For example, the request
      apply emacs
will invoke the Emacs text editor on the comment text.


The default for reformatting the comment after execution of the command
line is dependent on the original source of the comment text.  If
terminal input was used, the default is to reformat the comment; if
file input was used, the default is to not reformat the comment.  This
default may be changed by use of the -fill and -no_fill control
arguments on the forward request line.  Additionally, whatever default
is specified may be overriden for one invocation of the apply request
by use of the control arguments described above.
