10/11/83  read_mail (forward) request:  fill, fi

Syntax:  fi {-control_args}


Function:  reformats the comment text according to the "fill-on" and
"align-left" modes of compose.


Control arguments:
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length to use when reformatting the comment text.
   If this control argument is not given, the line length specified on
   the forward request line will be used; if, however, no line length
   was specified on the forward request line, a line length of 62
   will be used.


Notes:
If the -fill control argument, which is the default for terminal input,
was specified on the forward request line, the comment will be
reformatted after each use of the qedx and apply requests.  This
automatic reformatting can be overriden by use of the -no_fill control
arguments to these requests.
