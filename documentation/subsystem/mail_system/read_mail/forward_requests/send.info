10/11/83  read_mail (forward) request:  send

Syntax:  send


Function:  forwards the messages with the supplied comment and returns
to the read_mail request loop.


Notes:
Unlike the send_mail send request, this request automatically exits the
forward sub-request loop.  If any errors occur while forwarding one of
the messages, the user will be left in the read_mail request loop and
will not be returned to the forward sub-request loop.
