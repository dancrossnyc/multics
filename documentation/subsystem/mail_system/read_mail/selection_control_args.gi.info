10/20/83  Message selection control arguments:

The list, print, print_header, delete, and retrieve requests accept
several control arguments to supply further criteria for message
selection.


Application of selection control arguments:
The selections implied by these control arguments are applied to the
messages identified by any message specifiers given to the request.  If
no message specifiers are given, all messages of the appropriate type
in the mailbox are considered for selection.  For example, the request
line:

      list 23:30 -from Palter.Multics

lists all non-deleted messages in the mailbox from message #23
through #30 which were sent by the user Palter.Multics.


Selection classes:
These control arguments are divided into four classes -- subject
selection, time selection, author selection, and recipient selection.
If several control arguments from one class are provided, a message
need only satisfy one of the selections in that class to be considered
by the request.  If control arguments from more than one class are
provided, a message must satisfy one of the selections in all of these
classes provided to be considered by the request.  For example, the
request line:

      list -from Palter.Multics -from Sibert.Multics -after 1/1/82

lists all non-deleted messages in the mailbox which were both sent by
either of the two users Palter.Multics and Sibert.Multics and sent any
time from January 1982 to the present.  (Ie: a message sent by
Palter.Multics on 23 December 1981 would not be listed).


Case sensitivity of selection:
Control arguments are provided to allow subject selection and qedx
regular expression matching for author and recipient selections to
ignore the distinction between upper and lower case characters when
examining header fields.  Thus,

      -sj foo -non_case_sensitive

will match a Subject field if it contains any of the strings "foo",
"FOO", "Foo", etc.

-case_sensitive, -cs
   causes subject selections and qedx regular expression searches for
   author and recipient selections to be case sensitive.  (Default)
-non_case_sensitive, -ncs
   causes subject selections and qedx regular expression searches for
   author and recipient selections to be case insensitive.


Subject selection:
Subject selection control arguments may use either qedx regular
expressions or literal matches.  The string value (STR) supplied to
these control arguments is interpreted as a qedx regular expression if
it is surrounded by slashes (/); otherwise, a literal occurence of the
string must appear in the header field.

If the string contains any spaces, horizontal tabs, quotes,
parentheses, or brackets, it must be enclosed in quotes to avoid
misinterpretation by the request line processor and any quotes in the
string must be doubled.

For example:

      -sj /^read_mail/

only selects messages whose Subject fields start with the string
"read_mail".


-subject STR, -sj STR,
-subject /STR/, -sj /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose Subject fields
   match the specified STR.
-in_reply_to STR, -irt STR,
-in_reply_to /STR/, -irt /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose In-Reply-To
   fields match the specified STR.


Time selection:
Time selection control arguments are applied to the date/time that the
message was created as indicated in the message's Date header field.

In the following descriptions, DT, DT1, and DT2 represent date/time
strings.  For details of the acceptable date/time string formats, type:

      .. help date_time_strings.gi

In the case of -between, -after, and -before, the date/times specified
are truncated to an appropriate midnight.  For example:

      -between 9/1/82 9/30/82

will match all messages created during the month of September 1982.


-between DT1 DT2, -bt DT1 DT2
   selects any messages of the appropriate type which were created
   between the days specified by DT1 and DT2, inclusive.
-after DT, -af DT
   selects any messages of the appropriate type which were created on
   or after the date specified by DT.
-before DT, -be DT
   selects any messages of the appropriate type which were created
   before the date specified by DT.
-date DT, -dt DT
   selects any messages of the appropriate type which were created on
   the date specified by DT.


The following time selection control arguments do not truncate the
date/times specified to an appropriate midnight and, therfore, provide
finer control on the messages selected by time:

-between_time DT1 DT2, -btt DT1 DT2
   selects any messages of the appropriate type which were created
   between the date/times specified by DT1 and DT2, respectively.
-after_time DT, -aft DT
   selects any messages of the appropriate type which were created
   after the date/time specified by DT.
-before_time DT, -bet DT
   selects any messages of the appropriate type which were created
   before the date/time specified by DT.


Author and recipient selection:
Author and recipient selection control arguments either may exactly
match the individual addresses within the appropriate header field or
may use a qedx regular expression match against the entire content of
the header field as single string.  If the value supplied to these
control arguments is surrounded by slashes, it is interpreted as a qedx
regular expression to match against the entire content of the header
field; otherwise, the value, which might actually consist of several
tokens, is interpreted as an address which must exactly match one or
more of the addresses in the field.  For a description of the valid
syntax for an address, type:

      help addresses.gi -section control argument


If a qedx regular expression match is requested and the string contains
any spaces, horizontal tabs, quotes, parentheses, or brackets, it must
be enclosed in quotes to avoid misinterpretation by the request line
processor and any quotes in the string must be doubled.

For example:

      -from /Palter.*MIT/

matches any message whose From field contains the two strings "Palter"
and "MIT" and:

      -to gmp -at System-M

matches any message one of whose primary recipients is the user named
"gmp" on the foreign system "System-M".


Author selection:
-from address, -fm address
-from /STR/, -fm /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose From field
   either contains the specified address or matches the given qedx
   regular expression.
-reply_to address, -rpt address
-reply_to /STR/, -rpt /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose Reply-To field
   either contains the specified address or matches the given qedx
   regular expression.


Recipient selection:
-recipient address, -rcp address
-recipient /STR/, -rcp /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose To, cc, bcc, or
   Redistributed-To fields either contains the specified address or
   matches the given qedx regular expression.
-to address, -to /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose To field either
   contains the specified address or matches the given regular
   expression.
-cc address, -cc /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose cc field either
   contains the specified address or matches the given regular
   expression.


-bcc address, -bcc /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose bcc field either
   contains the specified address or matches the given regular
   expression.
-forwarded_to address, -fwdt address
-forwarded_to /STR/, -fwdt /STR/
   selects any messages of the appropriate type whose Redistributed-To
   field either contains the specified address or matches the given
   regular expression.
