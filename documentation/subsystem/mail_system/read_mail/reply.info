List of read_mail control arguments specifying reply defaults:
   The following control arguments (described above) may be specified
   on the read_mail command line in order to change the default
   behavior of the reply request within an invocation of read_mail.


-fill, -fi
-no_fill, -nfi
-line_length N, -ll N
   controls reformatting of the reply within send_mail.
-include_original, -io
-no_include_original, -nio
-indent N, -ind N

-include_authors, -iat
-no_include_authors, -niat
-include_recipients, -irc
-no_include_recipients, -nirc
-include_self, -is
-no_include_self, -nis
   specifies the recipients of the reply.


Notes on recipients:
By default, the reply will be sent only to the authors of the original
messages or to those recipients specified by the authors to receive
replies in place of the authors.  In the rest of this info file, the
term "authors of the original messages" acutally means either the
authors or their designated agents.

The -to and -include_authors control arguments are used to specify the
primary recipients for the reply.  If the -to control argument is used
and -include_authors does not appear on the request line, only those
addresses specified after -to are used as the primary recipients of the
reply.  If both -to and -include_authors are used on the request line,
the primary recipients of the message will be the authors of the
original messages and the addresses specified after the -to control
argument.  Use of -include_authors on the read_mail command line does
not affect this interaction of -to and -include_authors on the reply
request line.


The -cc, -bcc, and -include_recipients control arguments are used to
specify the secondary and "blind" recipients for the reply.  If
-include_recipients is specified either on the reply request line or
the read_mail command line, all primary and secondary recipients of the
original messages are included as secondary recipients of the reply and
all "blind" recpients of the original messages are included as "blind"
recipients of the reply.  If -cc is used on the request line, the
addresses following the -cc control argument are added to the list of
secondary recipients of the reply.  If -bcc is used on the request
line, the addresses following the -bcc control argument are added to
the list of "blind" recipients of the reply.


For example, the command line

    read_mail -include_recipients

in conjunction with the request line

    reply -to Palter.Multics -cc Sibert.Multics

composes a reply for the current message which is sent to
Palter.Multics as the sole primary recipient, to all the primary and
secondary recipients of the current message plus Sibert.Multics as the
secondary recipients, and to all the "blind" recipients of the current
message again as "blind" recipients.


Notes:
This request will acknowledge any messages requiring acknowledgement
unless -no_acknowledge is specified on the read_mail command line.

Unless overriden by use of the -abbrev, -no_abbrev, or -profile control
arguments, the send_mail invocation created by this request will have
the same state of request line abbreviation expansion and use the same
profile as the current read_mail invocation.

Unless overriden by use of the -debug or -no_debug control arguments,
the send_mail invocation created by this request will have the same
debugging mode (on/off) as the current read_mail invocation.


Unless overriden by use of the -subject or -no_subject control
arguments, this request will use the first non-blank subject found in
the original messages as the subject of the reply.  Additionally, this
subject will be prefixed by the string "Re: " if not already present.

This request will construct an In-Reply-To field for the reply message
identifying the original messages being answered by this reply.  For a
description of the contents of this field, type:
      help message_format.gi -search in-reply-to
