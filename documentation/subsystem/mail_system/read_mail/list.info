Notes on listing format:
One line is printed for each message.  Its format is:

   N*SA    (L)F  MM/DD/YY HH:MM  AUTHOR		SUBJECT

where N is the message number and L is the number of lines in the body
of the message.  The "*", "S", "A", and "F" are optional flags and are
described below.  MM/DD/YY HH:MM is the date/time when the message was
created.  AUTHOR is that part of the first author's name which will fit
in the space provided; if the first author does not have a name, the
printed representation of his address is used instead; the authors of a
message are listed in the From field.  SUBJECT is that part of the
message's subject which will fit on the remainder of the line; if the
message is an interactive message and does not have a subject, the
actual text of the message is used instead.


The * after the message number appears if this is the current message.
If "-idl" or "-odl" is specified and this message has been marked for
deletion, an exclamation point (!) appears here instead. If this
message cannot be deleted because its access class is not equal to
the user's process authorization, an ampersand (&) appears here
instead.

An "S" appears in the next column if the message has previously been
printed by the print request. The "S" indicates a "seen" message, as
referred to by the "seen", "unseen", and "new" message specifier
keywords.

An "A" appears in the next column if the message requires an
acknowledgement and one has not yet been delivered.

An "F" appears after the line count if the message was forwarded by
one of its recipients to the mailbox being examined.
