path
   is the pathname of the segment to which the messages are written.
   The suffix "mail" is added if necessary.

   data present in the segment.  (Default)
-truncate, -tc
   truncates the segment before writing the messages.
-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when processing the message_specifiers to determine which
   messages will be written.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)


-delete, -dl
   marks the specified messages for deletion on exit from read_mail
   if all messages are successfully written.
-no_delete, -ndl
   does not mark the messages for deletion.  (Default)
-reverse, -rv
   writes the messages in descending numeric order.
-no_reverse, -nrv
   writes the messages in ascending numeric order.  (Default)


Notes:
If the segment identified by the path argument does not exist, it will
be created automatically.

This request will acknowledge any messages requiring acknowledgement
unless -no_acknowledge is specified on the read_mail command line.
