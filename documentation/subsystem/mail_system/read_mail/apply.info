Syntax:  ap {message_specifier} {-control_args} command_line


Function:  places the text of the selected message(s) into a temporary
segment, catenates the pathname of this segment to the end of the given
command line, and executes the resulting Multics command line.  Each
message is processed individually.


Arguments:
message_specifier
   identifies to which messages the command line is to be applied.  If
   no message_specifier is supplied, the command line is applied to the
   current message.  For more information on message specifiers, type:
         help message_specifiers.gi
command_line
   is the Multics command line to which is catenated the pathname of
   the temporary segment before execution.


Control arguments:
-text
   specifies that the text of each message is to be included in the
   temporary segment.  (Default)
-no_text
   specifies that the text of each message is not to be included in the
   temporary segment.
-header, -he
   specifies that the header of each message is to be included in the
   temporary segment.  (Default)
-no_header, -nhe
   specifies that the header of each message is not to be included in
   the temporary segment.
-message message_specifier, -msg message_specifier
   specifies additional messages to which the command line is applied.


-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when processing the message_specifiers to determine which
   messages will be processed.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)
-delete, -dl
   marks the specified messages for deletion on exit from read_mail
   if all messages are successfully processed.
-no_delete, -ndl
   does not mark the messages for deletion.  (Default)
-reverse, -rv
   processes the messages in descending numeric order.
-no_reverse, -nrv
   processes the messages in ascending numeric order.  (Default)


Notes:
This request will acknowledge any messages requiring acknowledgement
unless -no_acknowledge is specified on the read_mail command line.

The command line may not modify the contents of the temporary segment.

-no_text and -no_header are mutually exclusive.

The supplied command line need not be enclosed in quotes.  However, if
there are (), [], or "'s in the command line which should be processed
by the Multics command processor, they should be enclosed in quotes to
prevent processing by read_mail's request processor.


Examples:
The request line:

      apply /frogs/ "do ""copy &1 &!; eor &! -dl"""

may be used to issue a separate output request for each message which
contains the string "frogs".
