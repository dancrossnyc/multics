10/20/83  read_mail request:  log

Syntax:  log {message_specifiers} {-control_args}


Function:  places a copy of the specified messages into the user's
"log" mailbox (logbox).


Arguments:
message_specifiers
   identifies which messages are to be logged.  If no
   message_specifiers are supplied, the current message is logged.  For
   more information on message specifiers, type:
         help message_specifiers.gi


Control arguments:
-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when processing the message_specifiers to determine which
   messages will be logged.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)


-delete, -dl
   marks the specified messages for deletion on exit from read_mail
   if all messages are successfully logged.
-no_delete, -ndl
   does not mark the messages for deletion.  (Default)
-reverse, -rv
   logs the messages in descending numeric order.
-no_reverse, -nrv
   logs the messages in ascending numeric order.  (Default)


Notes:
The user's logbox is the mailbox --
      >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
which will be created automatically by this request if it does not
already exist.  The user will be informed when the logbox is created.

This request will acknowledge any messages requiring acknowledgement
unless -no_acknowledge is specified on the read_mail command line.
