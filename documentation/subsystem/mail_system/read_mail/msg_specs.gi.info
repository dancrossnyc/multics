02/20/86  Message specifiers

Most read_mail requests are capable of processing several messages in
one invocation.  The messages which a request is to process are
identified by one or more message specifiers.


Selecting deleted messages:
Message specifiers normally refer only to the messages in a mailbox
which have not been marked for deletion.  Most requests accept the
following control arguments to modify the set of messages which are
available for selection by the request's message specifiers:


-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when interpreting any message specifiers to determine which
   messages to process.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)

If a message specifier identifies a range of messages (see below), at
least one message in that range must be of the appropriate type as
determined by the above control arguments.


Single message specifiers:
The simplest form of a message specifier is simply a message number
(eg: 3).  Message numbers are assigned by read_mail when it first reads
the mailbox.  Message numbers do not change during the invocation even
if messages are deleted.  The following keywords can be used to refer
to individual messages without having to know their message number:


first, f
   identifies the first message of the appropriate type in the mailbox.
   (Ie: the first message (#1) if -idl is given, the first deleted
   message if -odl is given, or the first non-deleted message if -ondl
   or none of these control arguments is given).
last, l
   identifies the last message of the appropriate type in the mailbox.
next, n
   identifies the next message of the appropriate type in the mailbox.
previous, p
   identifies the previous message of the appropriate type in the
   mailbox.


current, c, .
   refers to the current message.  The current message is initially the
   first message in the mailbox.  Most requests set the current message
   to the last message processed by the request.  For example, after
   executing the request:
         print 4 12
   the current message will be message #12.


first_seen, fs
   refers to the first undeleted "seen" message (see "seen" below).
first_unseen, fu
   refers to the first undeleted "unseen" message (see "unseen" below).
last_seen
   refers to the last undeleted "seen" message.
last_unseen, lu
   refers to the last undeleted "unseen" message.
next_seen, ns
   refers to the next undeleted "seen" message.
next_unseen, nu
   refers to the next undeleted "unseen" message.
previous_seen, ps
   refers to the previous undeleted "seen" message.
previous_unseen, pu
   refers to the previous undeleted "unseen" message.


Ranges of messages:
Ranges of messages can be identified by using two message numbers or
keywords separated by a colon (:).  For example,

      3:last

identifies all messages of the appropriate type from message #3 through
the last message of the appropriate type in the mailbox.

The keyword "all" is accepted as shorthand for "first:last" and
identifies all messages of the appropriate type in the mailbox.


Other keywords:
The following keywords specify collections of messages -

all
   refers to all messages of the appropriate type in the mailbox.
   It is shorthand for "first:last".
unseen
   refers to all messages of the appropriate type that have not yet
   been printed by the print request, by a user having "d" extended
   access to the mailbox.
seen
   refers to all messages of the appropriate type that have previously
   been printed by the print request, by a user having "d" extended
   accesss to the mailbox. These, when listed, have an "S" preceding
   the sender name.
new
   refers to all messages of the appropriate type after the last
   "seen" message, that is, after the latest one that was printed
   previously by the print request, by a user having "d" extended
   access to the mailbox.

Arithmetic:
Message numbers can be added and subtracted using "+" and "-".  For
example, if the current message is #20,

      current-5:current+10

identifies all messages of the appropriate type from message #15
through #30.  As this example demonstrates, arithmetic operations are
performed after any message keywords are converted to absolute numbers.
In other words, "current+2" does not mean the second message of the
appropriate type after the current message.


Regular expressions:
Qedx regular expressions can be used to select all messages of the
appropriate type in the mailbox which contain a given string.  The
regular expression must be enclosed in slashes (/); for an explanation
of the syntax of regular expressions, see the Qedx Text Editor's User
Guide, order number CG40.  If the regular expression contains spaces,
horizontal tabs, quotes ("), parentheses, or brackets, the entire
expression must be enclosed in quotes to avoid misinterpretation by the
request line processor; any quotes within the regular expression must
be doubled.  For example,

      "/said, ""I think/"

matches any message which contains the string

      said, "I think


A regular expression can be preceded by any of the keywords:

	first, last, next, previous, all

to select the first, last, etc.  message containing that string.
Additionally, two or more regular expressions can be combined by
connectors for logical and (&) and logical or (|).  For example,

      last/artificial/&/intelligence/

specifies the last message of the appropriate type containing both of
the strings "artificial" and "intelligence".


Examples:
In the following examples, assume that -only_non_deleted is specified
and that the current message is #15, the first non-deleted message
after the current message is #17, the last non-deleted message before
the current message is #10, the first non-deleted message is #3, and
the last non-deleted message is #23.


1  would select message #1.  However, as -ondl is specified and the
   first non-deleted message is message #3, this specifier would
   generate an error.

1:3
   selects all non-deleted messages from message #1 to #3 inclusive
   (ie: #3).

/foo/
   selects all non-deleted messages containing the string "foo".

last-3
   selects message #20.


l-3:l
   selects all non-deleted messages in the range from #20 to #23 (the
   last non-deleted message).

next+4
   selects message #21.

p-2
   selects message #8.

c:c+4
   selects all non-deleted messages in the range from #15 (the current
   message) to #19.


/frogs/|/propellent/
   selects all non-deleted messages containing either of the strings
   "frogs" or "propellent".

"l/ it /"
   selects the last non-deleted message containing the string " it ".
   This specifier is enclosed in quotes because it contains spaces
   which have special significance to the request processor.
