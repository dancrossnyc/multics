Syntax:  sv {message_specifiers} path {-control_args}


Function:  places a copy of the specified messages into the requested
"save" mailbox (savebox).


Arguments:
message_specifiers
   identifies which messages are to be saved.  If no message_specifiers
   are supplied, the current message is saved.  For more information on
   message specifiers, type:
         help message_specifiers.gi
path
   is the pathname of the savebox into which the messages are placed.
   The suffix "sv.mbx" is added if necessary.


Control arguments:
-include_deleted, -idl
   includes all messages in the mailbox whether or not they have been
   deleted when processing the message_specifiers to determine which
   messages will be saved.
-only_deleted, -odl
   includes only those messages which have been deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   includes only those messages which have not been deleted.  (Default)


-delete, -dl
   marks the specified messages for deletion on exit from read_mail
   if all messages are successfully saved.
-no_delete, -ndl
   does not mark the messages for deletion.  (Default)
-reverse, -rv
   saves the messages in descending numeric order.
-no_reverse, -nrv
   saves the messages in ascending numeric order.  (Default)


Notes:
If the savebox identified by the path argument does not exist, the user
will be queried for permission to create it.

This request will acknowledge any messages requiring acknowledgement
unless -no_acknowledge is specified on the read_mail command line.
