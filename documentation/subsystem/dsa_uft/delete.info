10/07/88 delete, dl

Syntax as a command:
dl arguments {-control_args}


Function:
The  delete request lets you delete a file on a remote host.


Arguments:
file
  file is the  name of the  file  to be  deleted  and must  be
  specified  in  a form  acceptable  to the  host on  which it
  resides.  It must be preceded by -name (or -nm)  if the file
  name  begins  with  a  "-";  it  must  be  followed  by "-at
  CORRESPONDENT"  where CORRESPONDENT must be  the  name given
  in the NIT (Network Information Table)  to  the  remote  UFT
  application.   It must be enclosed  in quotes if it contains
  spaces  or  special   characters.     If  the  CORRESPONDENT
  is  running  on   a  Multics  system,   then file  can be  a
  "star"  name,  and all  of the  files which match the "star"
  name will be deleted.


Control arguments:
-at CORRESPONDENT
  CORRESPONDENT  must be  the  name given  in the NIT (Network
  Information Table) to the remote UFT application.    The NIT
  associates  to  the  UFT correspondent name  its DSA network
  address (session_id and mailbox).
-billing STR
  specifies the  accounting identification used by  the remote
  host (not Multics); there is no default.


-catalogue <file_name>, -cat <file_name>
  for a non-Multics system,  <file_name> specifies a catalogue
  file.  The -catalogue control argument is required only when
  the  catalogue   file  for  the  file   description  is  not
  implicitly known.  <file_name> must be specified in a syntax
  acceptable to  the host on  which the file  will resides; it
  must be enclosed  in quotes if it contain  spaces or special
  characters.
-no_password, -npw
  if  the -no_password  control argument  is present  the user
  will  not  be  prompted  for  a  password  with a mask.  The
  password will not be used by the remote host to authenticate
  the submitter.


-password, -pw
  if the  -password control argument is present  the user will
  be prompted for a password with a mask.  The password may be
  used by the remote host  to authenticate the submitter.  For
  a remote  Multics system, the -password  control argument is
  mandatory.  (Default)
-person STR, -user STR
  STR  specifies the  remote user  identification used  by the
  remote host  on whose behalf  the delete is  to be executed.
  This may  be used by  the remote host  for authentication of
  the job  submitter.  The default  is the Multics  user_id of
  the user who submitted the request.
-project STR, -pj STR
  STR specifies the project  identification used by the remote
  host on whose behalf the delete is to be executed.


Examples:
  The following example illustrates the procedure for deleting
  a segment, cr_1, on a remote Multics host.
     dl uft_dest>cr_1 -at dsa.MUL1.FILETRAN
