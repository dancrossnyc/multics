10/07/88 rename, rn

Syntax as a command:
rn arguments {-control_args}


Function:
The  rename request lets you rename a file on a remote host.


Arguments:
file
  file indicates the name of  the  file to be renamed and must
  be specified in a  form acceptable  to the host on which the
  file resides.   It must be preceded by -name (or -nm) if the
  file name begins  with  a  "-".  It must be followed by "-at
  CORRESPONDENT"  where CORRESPONDENT must be  the  name given
  in  the  NIT (Network Information Table) to  the remote  UFT
  application.   It must be enclosed  in quotes if it contains
  spaces or  special  characters.


Control arguments:
-at CORRESPONDENT
  CORRESPONDENT  must be  the  name given  in the NIT (Network
  Information Table) to the remote UFT application.    The NIT
  associates  to  the  UFT correspondent name  its DSA network
  address (session_id and mailbox).
-billing STR
  specifies the  accounting identification used by  the remote
  host (not Multics); there is no default.
-catalogue <file_name>, -cat <file_name>
  for a non-Multics system,  <file_name> specifies a catalogue
  file.  The -catalogue control argument is required only when
  the  catalogue   file  for  the  file   description  is  not
  implicitly known.  <file_name> must be specified in a syntax
  acceptable to  the host on  which the file  will resides; it
  must be enclosed  in quotes if it contain  spaces or special
  characters.
-new_name STR, -nwnm STR
  STR must be the file_name of the file being renamed and must
  be specified in  a form acceptable to the host  on which the
  file resides.  It must be  enclosed in quotes if it contains
  spaces  or special  characters.  If  the remote  system is a
  Multics, the file name is an entryname.
-no_password, -npw
  if  the -no_password  control argument  is present  the user
  will  not  be  prompted  for  a  password  with a mask.  The
  password will not be used by the remote host to authenticate
  the submitter.
-password, -pw
  if the  -password control argument is present  the user will
  be prompted for a password with a mask.  The password may be
  used by the remote host  to authenticate the submitter.  For
  a remote  Multics system, the -password  control argument is
  mandatory.  (Default)
-person STR, -user STR
  STR  specifies the  remote user  identification used  by the
  remote host  on whose behalf  the delete is  to be executed.
  This may  be used by  the remote host  for authentication of
  the job  submitter.  The default  is the Multics  user_id of
  the user who submitted the request.
-project STR, -pj STR
  STR specifies the project  identification used by the remote
  host on whose behalf the delete is to be executed.


Examples:
  In the  following  example,  the  rename request is  used to
  rename the file cr_1 to rn_1.

     rn uft_dest>cr_1 -at dsa.MUL1.FILETRAN -nwnm rn_1
