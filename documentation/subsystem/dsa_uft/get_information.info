10/07/88 get_information, gi

Syntax as a command:
gi arguments {-control_args}


Function:
The  get_information  request   lets  you  obtain  information
about  a file on a remote host.  You  can obtain any or all of
the following information about a file on a remote host:
  file name
  history
  logical attributes
  physical attributes


Arguments:
file
  file   is  the  name  of  the  file  about  which  you  want
  information  and must  be specified in a form acceptable  to
  host  on  which  the  file resides.   It must be preceded by
  -name (or -nm)  if the file  name  begins  with  a  "-".  It
  must be followed by "-at CORRESPONDENT"  where CORRESPONDENT
  must be  the  name  given  in  the  NIT (Network Information
  Table) to the remote  UFT application.   It must be enclosed
  in quotes if it contains spaces or  special  characters.  If
  the  CORRESPONDENT is  running  on  a  Multics  system, then
  file  can be  a  "star"  name, and information on all of the
  files that match the "star" name will be returned.


Control arguments:
-at CORRESPONDENT
  CORRESPONDENT  must be  the  name given  in the NIT (Network
  Information Table) to the remote UFT application.    The NIT
  associates  to  the  UFT correspondent name  its DSA network
  address (session_id and mailbox).
-attributes ATTRIBUTES, -att ATTRIBUTES
  ATTRIBUTES   specifies  the  type   of  information  desired.
  ATTRIBUTES  are:   history,   logical,  physical,  space, or
  all.  You can specify several attributes.
-billing STR
  specifies the  accounting identification used by  the remote
  host (not Multics); there is no default.
-catalogue <file_name>, -cat <file_name>
  for a non-Multics system,  <file_name> specifies a catalogue
  file.  The -catalogue control argument is required only when
  the  catalogue   file  for  the  file   description  is  not
  implicitly known.  <file_name> must be specified in a syntax
  acceptable to  the host on  which the file  will resides; it
  must be enclosed  in quotes if it contain  spaces or special
  characters.
-no_password, -npw
  if  the -no_password  control argument  is present  the user
  will  not  be  prompted  for  a  password  with a mask.  The
  password will not be used by the remote host to authenticate
  the submitter.
-password, -pw
  if the  -password control argument is present  the user will
  be prompted for a password with a mask.  The password may be
  used by the remote host  to authenticate the submitter.  For
  a remote  Multics system, the -password  control argument is
  mandatory.  (Default)
-person STR, -user STR
  STR  specifies the  remote user  identification used  by the
  remote host  on whose behalf  the delete is  to be executed.
  This may  be used by  the remote host  for authentication of
  the job  submitter.  The default  is the Multics  user_id of
  the user who submitted the request.
-project STR, -pj STR
  STR specifies the project  identification used by the remote
  host on whose behalf the delete is to be executed.
