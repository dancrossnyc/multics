10/11/88 unified_file_transfer, uft

Syntax as a command:
uft path1 {path2} -to DEST | -from DEST {-control_args}


Function:
The  unified_file_transfer  (uft)  request  lets you  submit  an
interactive file transfer request to a remote host.


Arguments:
path1
  String  path1 specifies  the source  file to  be used  for the
  transfer.   It must be  preceded by -name  or -nm if  the file
  name begins with a "-".  <source_file> can be a "star" name if
  the  file  being  transferred   resides  on  the  host.   Star
  convention  is allowed,  and as  much requests  as found files
  will be entered.
path2
  String path2  specifies pathname of destination  file, and has
  the  same syntax  and  restrictions  as path1.   path2 accepts
  equal conventions.  When omitted,  equals path1 (Default).  If
  path1 uses star convention, equal convention is mandatory.


Control arguments:
-to STR
  to  be used  when file  is  to  be sent  from HOST  to REMOTE.
  String  STR is  correspondent name  given in  the NIT (Network
  Information  Table) to  the remote  UFT application.   The NIT
  associates  the  UFT  correspondent  name  to  its DSA network
  address (session_id and mailbox).  STR  can be given by active
  function "list_uft_correspondent" (refer  to command "luc" for
  details).


-from STR, -fm STR
  to be used when file is  to be received onto the HOST.  String
  STR   is  correspondent  name   given  in  the   NIT  (Network
  Information  Table) to  the remote  UFT application.   The NIT
  associates  the  UFT  correspondent  name  to  its DSA network
  address (session_id and mailbox).  STR  can be given by active
  function "list_uft_correspondent" (refer  to command "luc" for
  details).

See "Notes" below for referral of remaining control arguments.


Notes:
The syntax of the  unified_file_transfer request is the same  as
the enter_uft_request command.  All  control arguments  used  to
define  the file characteristics and other  request  options are
described   in the enter_uft_request.info  info  segment.   Type
"help eur" for a description of these control arguments.

Between two Multics  systems,  data  is read  and written without
consideration of the  file organization.   The bit count  of each
segment  of the destination file  is adjusted at the  end of  the
transfer to the same value as the bit count of  the corresponding
segment in the source  file.  There is no data_type translation.

Between a  Multics system  and  a  non-Multics system,  the  file
transfer is a "record" transfer; Multics reads or writes the file
transferred on a record basis using the vfile access methods.


Multics DSA UFT does not support tape files.  Tape files must  be
stored  in a  Multics  disk  file before  being sent  by  Multics
DSA UFT.  Multics DSA UFT  can receive  a file only  in a Multics
disk file.

The  Multics requestor  accepts transfers  between different file
organizations but  it does  not change  the format of the record.
It is your responsibility to ensure  that the  record format used
is appropriate for the destination file.


When specifying  control arguments  to  the unified_file_transfer
request, the control arguments used to define the characteristics
of the  destination file are  used to request the creation of the
remote  file.    Those   control   arguments   that   affect  the
characteristics  of  the  destination file are prefaced  by  "-d"
(for  example,  -d_status).  Those  control arguments that affect
the   source  file   are   prefaced    by   "-s"   (for  example,
-s_record_format).

Some systems do  not retain  file attributes  after file creation
(such  as data_type on Multics).  For  these systems,  it may  be
necessary to  define the missing file attributes in  the transfer
request.
