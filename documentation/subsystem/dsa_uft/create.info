10/07/88 create, cr

Syntax as a command:
cr arguments {-control_args}


Function:
The  create request  lets you  create a file  on a remote host
and  set the appropriate file attributes.   The create request
is a file management convenience tool.


Arguments:
file
  is  the  name of  the file  you  want to create.  It must be
  specified  in a  syntax acceptable to  the host on which the
  file is to reside.  file must be preceded by "-name" ("-nm")
  if the file name begins with a "-".  It must be followed  by
  "-at CORRESPONDENT" where CORRESPONDENT  is a  correspondent
  name given  in  the  NIT (Network Information Table)  to the
  remote UFT  application.    It must be enclosed in quotes if
  it contains spaces or special characters.


Control arguments:
-at CORRESPONDENT
  CORRESPONDENT  must be  the  name given  in the NIT (Network
  Information Table) to the remote UFT application.    The NIT
  associates  to  the  UFT correspondent name  its DSA network
  address (session_id and mailbox).
-billing STR
  specifies the  accounting identification used by  the remote
  host (not Multics); there is no default.


-catalogue <file_name>, -cat <file_name>
  for a non-Multics system,  <file_name> specifies a catalogue
  file.  The -catalogue control argument is required only when
  the  catalogue   file  for  the  file   description  is  not
  implicitly known.  <file_name> must be specified in a syntax
  acceptable to  the host on  which the file  will resides; it
  must be enclosed  in quotes if it contain  spaces or special
  characters.
-control_interval_format STR, -cif STR
  STR  specifies  the  control  interval  format.  The control
  interval      format      can      be     blocked_unspanned,
  unblocked_unspanned, blocked_spanned,  or unblocked_spanned.
  For Multics, there is no control interval format.


-control_interval_size N, -cis N
  indicates the control interval size to be used.  The maximum
  control interval size is 65535.
-data_type <data_type>, -dt <data_type>
  <data_type> can be either ascii, binary, ebcdic, gbcd, hbcd,
  jis or undefined.  It specifies the data code of the data to
  be contained in the file.  The default is "undefined".
-file_format STR, -ff STR
  STR  specifies the  specific format  of the  file.  The file
  format    can     be    disk_ufas_6_66,    disk_36_bit_ufas,
  disk_64_ufas, disk_68,  disk_66_gfrc, disk_64_bfas, disk_62,
  disk_6_no_ufas,       disk_ibm_no_vsdm,       disk_ibm_vsam,
  tape_ufas_ans_ascii,     tape_ufas_ebcdic,     tape_66_gfrc,
  tape_foreign,     diskette_basic_iso,    diskette_basic_ibm,
  cassette_standard_iso, or cassette_foreign.


-format_version N, -fv N
  N specifies  the specific version  of the file  format.  The
  format version can  be 0, 1, or 3.  The  format version is 1
  or 3 for tape_ufas_ans_ascii (the  default is 1).  For other
  formats, the default value is correct.
-max_record_length N, -mrl N
  specifies  the maximum  record length   for the  file to  be
  created.  The maximum record length that can be specified is
  65535.
-no_password, -npw
  if  the -no_password  control argument  is present  the user
  will  not  be  prompted  for  a  password  with a mask.  The
  password will not be used by the remote host to authenticate
  the submitter.


-options <options>, -opt <options> -status <options>,
-st <options>
  <options> can be either keep, new, or replace.  The -options
  control argument  indicates what should be done  if the file
  to be created  already exists.  If "new" then  an error will
  be  returned  (default);  if  "keep  or  truncate (tc)", the
  existing  file  will  be  kept  but  the  creation  will  be
  considered successful; if "replace  (rp)", then the existing
  file will be deleted and a new file created as specified.


-organization <file_organization>, -org <file_organization>
  <file_organization>  can be  sequential, relative,  indexed,
  extended_indexed,  general_indexed,  random,  queued, l6_r2,
  l6_r5, byte_stream, or unstructured.   It specifies the file
  organization  of the file  to be created.   Multics supports
  unstructured, sequential, relative, and general_indexed file
  organizations.  The default is sequential.
-password, -pw
  if the  -password control argument is present  the user will
  be prompted for a password with a mask.  The password may be
  used by the remote host  to authenticate the submitter.  For
  a remote  Multics system, the -password  control argument is
  mandatory.  (Default)


-person STR, -user STR
  STR  specifies the  remote user  identification used  by the
  remote host  on whose behalf  the delete is  to be executed.
  This may  be used by  the remote host  for authentication of
  the job  submitter.  The default  is the Multics  user_id of
  the user who submitted the request.
-project STR, -pj STR
  STR specifies the project  identification used by the remote
  host on whose behalf the delete is to be executed.
-record_format STR, -rf STR
  STR  is the  record format  to be  used for  the file.   The
  format can  be fixed, variable, or  undefined.  For Multics,
  the record format is always variable.


Examples:
  The  following example illustrates  the procedure for  creating a
  segment, cr_1, on a remote Multics host.
     cr uft_dest>cr_1 -at dsa.MUL1.FILETRAN
