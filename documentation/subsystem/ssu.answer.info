01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  answer

Syntax:  answer STR {-control_args} request_line


Function:	 provides preset answers to questions asked by another
request.


Arguments:
STR
   is the desired answer to any question.  If the answer is more than
   one word, it must be enclosed in quotes.  If STR is -query, the
   question is passed on to the user.  The -query control argument is
   the only one that can be used in place of STR.
request_line
   is any subsystem request line.  It can contain any number of
   separate arguments (i.e., have spaces within it) and need not be
   enclosed in quotes.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing (on the user's terminal) of both the question
   and the answer.
-call STR
   evaluates the active string STR to obtain the next answer in a
   sequence.  The active string is constructed from subsystem active
   requests and Multics active strings (using the subsystem's execute
   active request).  The outermost level of brackets must be omitted
   (ie: "forum_list -changed") and the entire string must be enclosed
   in quotes if it contains request processor special characters.  The
   return value "true" is translated to "yes", and "false" to "no".
   All other return values are passed as is.


-match STR
   answers only questions whose text matches STR.	 If STR is surrounded
   by slashes (/), it is interpreted as a qedx regular expression.
   Otherwise, answer tests whether STR is literally contained in the
   text of the question.  Multiple occurrences of -match and -exclude
   are allowed (see Notes below).  They apply to the entire request
   line.
-exclude STR, -ex STR
   passes on, to the user or other handler, questions whose text
   matches STR.  If STR is surrounded by slashes (/), it is interpreted
   as a qedx regular expression.  Otherwise, answer tests whether STR
   is literally contained in the text of the question.  Multiple
   occurrences of -match and -exclude are allowed (see Notes below).
   They apply to the entire request line.


-query
   skips the next answer in a sequence, passing the question on to the
   user.	The answer is read from the user_i/o I/O switch.
-then STR
   supplies the next answer in a sequence.
-times N
   gives the previous answer (STR, -then STR, or -query) N times only
   (where N is an integer).


Notes:
Answer provides preset responses to questions by establishing an
on unit for the condition command_question, and then executing the
designated request line.  If any request in the request line calls
the command_query_ subroutine (described in the MPM Subroutines) to
ask a question, the on unit is invoked to supply the answer.  The on
unit is reverted when the answer request returns to subsystem request
level.  See "List of System Conditions and Default Handlers" in the MPM
Reference Guide for a discussion of the command_question condition.

If a question is asked that requires a yes or no answer, and the preset
answer is neither "yes" nor "no", the on unit is not invoked.

The last answer specified is issued as many times as necessary, unless
followed by the -times N control argument.


The -match and -exclude control arguments are applied in the order
specified.  Each -match causes a given question to be answered if it
matches STR, each -exclude causes it to be passed on if it matches STR.
A question that has been excluded by -exclude is reconsidered if it
matches a -match later in the request line.  For example, the request
line:

answer yes -match /fortran/ -exclude /fortran_io/ -match /^fortran_io/

answers questions containing the string "fortran", except that it does
not answer questions containing "fortran_io", except that it does
answer questions beginning with "fortran_io".
