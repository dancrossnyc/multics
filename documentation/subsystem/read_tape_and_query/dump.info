Syntax: dump {offset} {n_words} {char_types}


Function:  displays the contents of the record buffer (filled
with the read_record request) on the users terminal.  If no
arguments are specified, the contents of the entire tape buffer
are displayed in octal format.  If the n_words argument is
specified, it must follow offset.  However, these arguments may
be positioned before or after any char_type arguments that may
be specified.  The offset and n_words arguments must be specified
in octal.  If offset is specified without being followed by
n_words, then the tape buffer is dumped starting with the
<offset>th word and ending with the last word in the tape buffer.


The char_type optional arguments allow interpretation of the data
contained in the tape buffer in various character formats.  If
more than one char_type argument is specified, then the tape
buffer is dumped with the first character interpretation,
followed by the next character interpretation, and so on until
all requested data formats have been dumped.  The value of
char_type can be selected from the following:

   -ascii
      displays the contents of the record buffer in octal with an
      ASCII interpretation of the data on the right side.

   -bcd
      displays the contents of the record buffer in octal with a BCD
      interpretation of the data on the right side


   -ebcdic
      displays the contents of the record buffer in octal with an
      EBCDIC interpretation of the data on the right side.

   -hex
      displays the record buffer in hexadecimal format.
