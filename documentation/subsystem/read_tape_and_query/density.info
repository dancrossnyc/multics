Syntax:  density N, den N


Function:  sets the tape density to N bits per inch (bpi), where
N can be 6250, 1600, 800, 556 or 200.  Density requests must be
issued while the tape is positioned at the BOT marker or a request
reject status results.  It is not normally necessary to set the
tape density as it is automatically set by read_tape_and_query
before the request loop is entered.
