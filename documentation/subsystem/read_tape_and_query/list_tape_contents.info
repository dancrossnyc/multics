Syntax: list_tape_contents {-long} {-label}, ltc {-lg} {-lbl}


Function:  displays information about each record on the tape.
The tape is positioned to BOT and each record is read in.  If
the tape is one of the five known standard types, the current
record is inspected to determine if it is a valid label or
trailer record; if so, information pertinent to that particular
label or trailer record is displayed, in interpreted format.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   The contents of the label record is displayed (in ASCII) as
   well.  Otherwise, the length of the current record is
   compared to the length of the last record read.  If the
   lengths are the same, a tally of the number of records with
   the same length is incremented.  If the length of the
   current record is different from that of the last record,
   or if an end of file mark is detected, a message is
   displayed that includes:  the number of records of equal
   length, and the record length in bits, words, 8-bit bytes,
   9-bit bytes, and 6-bit characters.


-label, -lbl
   only displays the label records.  This operation continues
   until the logical end of tape is reached (two end of file
   marks in succession or an end of volume trailer record,
   followed by an end of file mark).  The tape is repositioned
   to BOT after the list_tape_contents request is complete.
   Use of the -label argument with unlabeled tapes is treated
   as an error.
