Syntax:  read_record {-count N}, rdrec {-ct N}


Function:  reads the current record into a temporary buffer.
If the tape is one of the five known standard labeled tapes,
the record is checked to determine if it is a label or trailer
record; if it is, information pertinent to that particular
record type is displayed.  Otherwise, information pertaining
to the physical record length in bits, words, 8-bit bytes,
9-bit bytes, and 6-bit characters is displayed.  When the
-count argument is specified, N records are read, overlaying
each other in the temporary buffer.  Note that when read_record
encounters a tape mark, it leaves you positioned at the
beginning of the next file.


Control Argument:
-count N, -ct N
   When the -count argument is specified, N records are read,
   overlaying each other in the temporary buffer.
