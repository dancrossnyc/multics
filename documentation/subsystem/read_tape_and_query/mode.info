06/12/87  mode

Syntax:  mode STR


Function:  sets the hardware mode for reading tape to STR.


Arguments:
STR can be one of the following modes:
   bin
      eight bit bytes are read in and packed (nine eight bit
      bytes per memory double word).  This is the default mode.

   bcd
      reads in tape that was originally written in binary coded
      decimal (BCD).  The hardware performs input character
      conversion.

   nine
      eight bit bytes are read in and converted to nine bit bytes
      by forcing the most significant bit of each nine bit byte
      to "0"b.
