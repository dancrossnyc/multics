:Info:  Help_With_a_Prompt:  Help With a Prompt

A "prompt" is a system question (or request) for more information.
When you select a menu option, the Executive Mail facility often
replies with a prompt to ask you more specifically what you want to do.

Anytime you are prompted for a response while using Executive Mail, you
can type a question mark (?)  followed by RETURN to get an explanation
of what you are being asked for.

If you are asked to provide a number or name from an undisplayed list,
you can display the list by responding with two question marks (??)
followed by RETURN.

If you wish to correct a response to a prompt, you can use the same
keystrokes used when editing mail.  Since responses are made on one
line, not all of the editing-mail responses are applicable.  Those that
are, are listed below.  When using keystrokes that employ the "CTL"
key, hold the CTL key down while typing the associated character.  With
keystrokes that use the "ESC" key, press and immediately release the
ESC key followed by the associated character key.  No space is required
after the CTL or ESC key and the associated character key.

CTL f     moves the cursor right one character.
ESC f     moves the cursor right one word.
CTL e     moves the cursor to the end of the line.
CTL a     moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
CTL b     moves the cursor left one character.
ESC b     moves the cursor left one word.
CTL d     deletes the one character the cursor is under or covering.
ESC d     deletes one word to the right of the cursor.
BACKSPACE deletes one character to the left of the cursor (the DEL key
          also does this).
ESC BACKSPACE deletes one word to the left of the cursor (ESC DEL also
          does this).
CTL k     erases all text between the cursor and the end of the line.
@         erases all text between the cursor and the beginning of the
          line.
CTL Y     retrieves any piece of erased text, longer than one
          character, and inserts it at the current cursor position.


:Info:  Editing_Mail:  Editing Mail

Whenever you are typing or editing some part of a message or mailing
list, you can use the set of keystrokes listed below to perform the
functions indicated.  Keystrokes beginning with the "CTL" key move the
cursor one character or one line at a time.  To perform these
keystrokes, hold the associated CTL key down while typing the
associated character key.

Most of the keystrokes beginning with the "ESC" key move the cursor one
word at a time or one whole screen at a time.  Also, they are performed
differently than the other keystrokes.  To perform them, press and
immediately release the ESC key followed by the associated character
key.  No space is required after the CTL or ESC key and the associated
character key.

Moving the Cursor Forward

     CTL f     moves the cursor right one character.
     ESC f     moves the cursor right one word.
     CTL e     moves the cursor to the end of the line.
     CTL n     moves the cursor to the next line.
     ESC n     moves the cursor to the top of the next screenful of
               text.
     ESC >     moves the cursor to the end of the text.

Moving the Cursor Backward

     CTL b     moves the cursor left one character.
     ESC b     moves the cursor left one word.
     CTL a     moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
     CTL p     moves the cursor to the previous line.
     ESC p     moves the cursor to the top of the previous screenful of
               text.
     ESC <     moves the cursor to the beginning of the text.

Erasing Text

     CTL d     deletes the one character the cursor is under or
               covering.
     ESC d     deletes one word to the right of the cursor.
     BACKSPACE deletes one character to the left of the cursor (the DEL
               key also does this).
     ESC BACKSPACE deletes one word to the left of the cursor (ESC DEL
               also does this).
     CTL k     erases all text between the cursor and the end of the
               line.
     @         erases all text between the cursor and the beginning of
               the line.
     CTL y     retrieves any piece of erased text, longer than one
               character, and inserts it at the current cursor
               position.

The Exit and Other Keystrokes

     ESC q     ceases editing, sends the message, and returns the
               cursor to the menu.
     ESC t     ceases editing, defers (saves) the message, and returns
               the cursor to the menu.
     ESC m     adjusts the margins in a paragraph when they have become
               ragged.
     ESC r     redisplays the message when the screen become jumbled.
     ESC g     prompts for the pathname of an existing file, gets that
               file, and inserts it at the current cursor location.

Getting Help

     ESC ?     displays a complete editor command summary or the
               documentation for a given sequence.

If you want to include a character such as @ in a letter, type
backslash (\) first and then type the "at" character (@) and the @ is
placed in your text instead of performing the usual operation (i.e.,
erasing the text between the cursor and the beginning of the line).

You can repeat the operation of any keystroke by preceding it with the
sequence "ESC" and the number of times you want it repeated (e.g., "ESC
5\@" produces "@@@@@" in the text).

You can repeat the operation of any keystroke by preceding it with the
sequence "ESC" and the number of times you want it repeated (e.g., "ESC
5\@" produces "@@@@@" in the text).


:Info:  Retrieving_Erased_Text:  Retrieving Erased Text

When you erase more than one character at a time, those characters are
stored and can be retrieved.  They are stored in a sequence of 10
positions, with the last item erased stored in the first position.  For
example, if you erase an entire line using "CTL k", that line is stored
in the first of the ten positions.  If you later erase a word with a
"CTL d", that word goes into the first position and the line killed
previously is moved to the second position.  When you retrieve erased
text with "CTL y", you get back the last item erased.  You can,
however, specify another position in the sequence by pressing and
releasing "ESC" followed by the number of the position you want; then
follow with "CTL y" (e.g., "ESC 2 CTL y" returns the second to last
item).  Retrieved text is placed to the right of the cursor.


:Info:  Right_Margins:  Right Margins

When you are typing text, the right margin is controlled automatically
for you, so you do not have to type RETURN when you reach the end of
the line.  If the right margin becomes ragged because you have erased
or added text, you can reformat by using "ESC m".  That corrects the
margins of the paragraph in which the cursor is located.


:Info:  BREAK_Key:  BREAK Key

The BREAK or BRK key enables you to move the cursor out of the lower
portion of your screen back into the menu.  When you do this, the work
being done in the lower portion of the screen is discarded.  If you
press the BREAK key while in the editor, you are asked if you really
want to quit before the work is discarded.


:Info:  Mail_Files:  Mail Files

There are two types of mail; incoming mail and filed mail.  Messages
sent to you are received in your incoming mailbox.  You can leave
messages in the incoming mailbox after reading them, though it is
usually more convenient to file them.  Mail files are used to store
messages.  You can create as many mail files as you like.

Another type of file you can construct is a mailing list.  It lists
names of people who might receive messages from you as a group.  Such
lists are stored for repeated use.


:Info:  Current_Messages:  Current Messages

When you are processing messages with either the Process Incoming Mail
menu or the Process Filed Mail menu, options in the menu operate on the
current message(s) of the mailbox (or mail file) in which you are
working.  The current message(s) are message(s) marked explicitly by
you or implicitly by Executive Mail to be the target of some operation.
When you enter a menu such as the Process Incoming Mail menu, message
number 1 is automatically the current message and remains so until you
do something to change it, such as discard it or choose another
message.  Then when you choose a menu option, that option operates on
message number 1 or the message that you have selected.


:Info:  Selecting_Messages:  Selecting Messages

After entering the Process Incoming Mail and Process Filed Mail menus,
you can change the current message(s) by using the options Next Message
and Select Messages.  For example, suppose you have just entered
Process Incoming Mail and want to make message number 5 the current
message.  Because you have just entered this menu, the current message
is message 1.  So you choose the Select Messages option, and you are
asked which messages you would like to make current.  You can supply
several numbers here, each separated from the others by blanks, and
have several current messages at the same time, but since you want just
message number 5, you type "5".  Message number 5 becomes the current
message and it is listed on your screen.

Suppose that you then want to make message number 6 the current
message.  You can accomplish this simply by selecting the Next Message
option.  If, however, message number 5 is the highest numbered message
when you select this option, message number 1 becomes the current
message and it is listed automatically.

You can select messages in Process Incoming Mail and Process Filed Mail
by responding with the word "search" when asked which message(s) to
make current.  For a further explanation of how to do this, read the
"Searching Messages" option listed in the menu from which you selected
the information you are reading now.

You can also select messages in Process Incoming Mail and Process Filed
Mail by responding with the word "date" when asked which message(s) to
make current.  For a further explanation of how to do this, read the
"Date Selection" option listed in the menu from which you selected the
information you are reading now.

After messages are selected, an automatic listing of the current
messages are displayed.


:Info:  Keywords:  Keywords

A keyword is a term used to specify a message or set of messages.  When
prompted by the Select Messages option, you can select the current
message(s) with one of the following keywords:

first, f     specifies the first message in the mailbox or mail file.
last, l      specifies the last message in the mailbox or mail file.
next, n      specifies the message after the current message, or in the
             case of a set of current messages, the one after the
             highest numbered current message.
prev, p      specifies the message before the current message, or in
             the case of a set of current messages, the one before the
             lowest numbered current message.
all, a       specifies all of the messages in the mailbox or mail file.
seen         specifies all of the messages in the mailbox that have
             previously been display.
unseen       specifies all of the messages in the mailbox that have not
             been displayed.
new          specifies the messages in the mailbox that follow the last
             "seen" message.
date         specifies a range of dates from "earliest in the range" to
             "latest in the range".


:Info:  Specifying_Ranges:  Specifying Ranges

To select a range of message numbers, you can type the lowest and
highest message numbers of the range, rather than type each number in
the range.  For example:

2:5

The first number must be less than the second number.  You can also use
the keyword "first" instead of the first number, and you can use the
keyword "last" in place of the second number, though you cannot use
both of these keywords together, such as in the expression
"first:last."

If you use the Next Message option while there is a range of current
messages specified, the current message becomes the message after the
highest numbered current message.

To select a range of dates, you can type the word "date" and be
prompted for the earliest date and the latest date in the range.  The
first date must be earlier than the second date.


:Info:  Scrolling:  Scrolling

When you are selecting a message, a mail file, or a mailing list for
processing, you can answer the request for its name with two question
marks (??), and you are provided a complete list of your messages, mail
files, or mailing lists, whichever is appropriate.  This list is
automatically displayed without a prompt, if you have set the
personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to yes.

If there are too many items in this list to fit on the screen at one
time, you can scroll the list ahead to read items further down the list
by using function key F7 (or "ESC h", if you are using escape
sequences).  If you want to scroll the list back to read items that
have already been displayed, use function key F6 (or "ESC l" if you are
using escape sequences).


:Info:  Exiting_Executive_Mail:  Exiting Executive Mail

Whenever the terminal cursor is in the menu portion of the screen, you
can leave the Executive Mail facility by typing function key F4 (or
"ESC q", if you are using escape sequences).

If the cursor is in the lower portion of the screen, you must move it
back to the menu portion of the screen before you can get out of
Executive Mail.  You can move the cursor back in two ways.  If you are
ready to send a message just typed, press and release the "ESC" key
followed by the letter "q".  That sends the message and returns the
cursor to the menu.  If you wish to save the message you are typing and
send it later, press and release the "ESC" key followed by the letter
"t".  That defers the message and returns the cursor to the menu.  If
you are not typing a message or do not care to send or save what was
typed, press the BREAK (or BRK) key to get back to the menu.


:Info:  Function_Keys:  Function Keys

Function keys are usually located along the top of the keyboard and are
labeled F1, F2, etc.  If your terminal does not have function keys, or
enough of them to perform all the required functions, Executive Mail
substitutes a two character sequence (the ESC key followed by a letter
which is listed below in parentheses after the matching function key)
to perform the individual functions.  Function keys (or their
equivalents) operate when the cursor is in the menu portion of your
screen.  A personalize mail option is available if you prefer to always
use the escape sequences, regardless of the capabilities of your
terminal.

You can quickly get an explanation of individual function keys by
pressing the F1 key (or "ESC ?") then pressing the function key (or
equivalent escape sequence) you want help with.  For example, to get an
explanation of function key F2, press F1 and at the prompt, press F2.
If you are using escape sequences, press and release the "ESC" key
followed by "?", and at the prompt", use "ESC" and "f".  Do NOT press
RETURN.  A brief explanation of the keys is presented here:

F1 (ESC ?)     provides help with menu options and function keys.
F2 (ESC f)     returns you to the first menu, the one called Executive
               Mail.
F3 (ESC p)     returns you to the previous menu.
F4 (ESC q)     gets you out of the Executive Mail facility.
F5 (ESC r)     causes the menu or menus on the screen to be
               redisplayed.
F6 (ESC l)     enables you to look at the portion of a list that has
               scrolled off the top of your screen.
F7 (ESC h)     enables you to look at the portion of a list that is in
               the next screen, coming up from the bottom of your
               terminal.
F8 (ESC e)     enables you to execute a Multics command while working
               in Executive Mail.  In order to use this key or
               sequence, you must set the personalize mail option
               "Multics Command Mode" to yes.  You get back to the menu
               by typing "pi".


:Info:  User_Names:  User Names

Names of message recipients, whether placed on mailing lists or typed
individually on messages, can be one of the following.

1.   A user name and project name in the form:  Name.Project

     Name is the precise name used to identify that person on the
     computer and Project identifies the project or department that
     person is in.

2.   A name in the system's mail table.  The mail table provides each
     user with a unique name which can be used in place of the
     Name.Project.

3.   A Forum meeting by name in the form:  {forum meetingname}

     Meetingname is the name or absolute pathname of the Forum meeting.
     The brackets {} and the word "forum" are required.

4.   A user on another computer system in the form:  Name at System

     Name identifies the user or group of users to receive the message
     and System identifies the computer system where the user is
     located.

Your System Administrator can help you find the names or addresses that
you need in sending mail.


:Info:  Searching_Messages:  Searching Messages

When you are selecting current messages with the Select Messages
option, you can specify messages that have a certain word or words.  To
do this, type the word "search" when the Select Messages option asks
which messages are to be made current.  You are then asked to type in
what exactly is to be searched for (a word, words, or part of a word).
All messages which are found to have these characters in their heading
or text become the current messages.


:Info:  User_Mailbox:  User Mailbox

It is possible in Executive Mail to select another user's incoming
mailbox to process when in the Process Filed Mail menu.  This allows
you to read and delete messages that you send that user.  It also
allows you to read the messages in certain other mailboxes that are set
up as "read only".  The options that are available in the menu depend
on what access is set for the mailbox selected.

You may select a mailbox by entering the user name of the mailbox at
the prompt for the mail file you wish to process.


:Info:  Date_Selection:  Date Selection

When you are selecting current messages with the Select Messages
option, you can specify messages that were created on a certain date or
between a range of dates.  To do this, type the word "date" when the
Select Messages option asks which messages are to be made current.  You
are then prompted for the earliest date in the range and the latest
date in the range.  When you enter a valid date at each prompt, all
messages which were created between the first date at 00:00 thru the
second date at 23:59 become the current messages.  Pressing RETURN at
either prompt and entering a valid date at the other, selects all
messages created on that date.  To select messages created on the
current date, just press RETURN at both prompts.  Examples of dates:

February 15, 1985             15 Feb 1985         02/15/1985
2/15/85                       1985-02-15          85-2-15
today                         yesterday           now


:Info:  Summary_of_Function-Escape_Keys:  Summary of Function-Escape
Keys

F1 (ESC ?)     help with menu options, function keys, or general items.
F2 (ESC f)     return to the first menu:  Executive Mail.
F3 (ESC p)     return to the previous menu.
F4 (ESC q)     quit the Executive Mail facility.

F8 (ESC e)     to execute a Multics command while in xmail if the
               personalize option "Multics Command Mode" is set to yes.


:Info:  Deferred_Messages:  Deferred Messages

There are two types of deferred messages, new messages that are
deferred while editing in the Send Mail menu, and replies to messages
that are deferred while editing in either the Process Incoming Mail or
Process Filed Mail menus.  The "ESC t" sequence in the editor is used
to defer messages.

New messages that are deferred while editing can be given a name and
used later on by options in the Send Mail menu.  Deferred replies
however, are linked to one particular message.  After the deferred
reply is saved, it is automatically available to you when you try to
reply to the message again.  A prompt asks, before entering the editor,
if you wish to use the deferred reply.  At this time you can use the
deferred reply, or delete it.  If a deferred reply is not used within
30 days, a message appears when you exit executive mail to ask if you
wish to review it.  This allows you to delete or just review the
deferred reply.
