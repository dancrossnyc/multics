:Info:  New_Message:  New Message

This option enables you to write a message, which may be sent to the
recipients when completed, or may be saved to be sent later.  When you
choose this option, the mail editor is set in place so that you can
specify the subject and recipients and write the message.

When entering recipients, you can use a user name and project (e.g.,
Smith.Pubs), a name from the mail table within Multics (i.e., a name
that equals Name.Project), a Forum meeting pathname, a user on another
computer system, and/or the name of a mailing list (e.g., managers).
Be sure to place a comma between each name.  Depending on how you exit
the mail editor, the prepared message is either sent to the
recipient(s) immediately, or it is deferred.  In the latter case, you
are asked to give a name to the deferred message, and the message is
saved until you either send it or discard it.


:Info:  Deferred_Message:  Deferred Message

This option enables you to send a previously prepared and deferred new
message.  After selecting this option, you are asked for the name of
the deferred message.  At this point you can type two question marks
(??)  followed by RETURN to get a list of your deferred messages.  You
can then select a message from the displayed list.  This list is
automatically displayed without a prompt, if you have set the
personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to yes.

The previously prepared message is displayed and you may add to or
change the message before sending it.


:Info:  File_Sent_Message:  File Sent Message

This option enables you to store a copy of the last message sent in a
selected mail file.  After selecting this option, you are asked for the
name of a mail file.  At this point you can type two question marks
(??)  followed by RETURN to get a list of your mail files, and you can
then select a file from the displayed list.  This list is automatically
displayed without a prompt, if you have set the personalize mail option
"Display Lists As Menus" to yes.


:Info:  Print_Sent_Message:  Print Sent Message

This option produces a printed copy of the last message sent, even if
you have already filed it.


:Info:  Print_Deferred_Msg:  Print Deferred Msg

This option enables you to print a copy of a previously prepared and
deferred message.  After selecting this option, you are asked for the 
name of the deferred message.  At this point you can type two question

automatically displayed without a prompt, if you have set the
personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to yes.


:Info:  Mailing_Lists:  Mailing Lists

This option enables you to create, review, and update mailing lists.  A
mailing list is a list of addresses that can be used again and again
when you are sending, replying, or forwarding mail.  When you choose
this option, another menu is displayed giving you options to create,
review, and/or change a mailing list.  When you create a mailing list
you are asked for a new mailing list name.  The mail editor is then set
for you to enter addresses.

When entering addresses, you can use a user name and project (e.g.,
Smith.Pubs), a name from the mail table within Multics (i.e., a name
that equals Name.Project), a Forum meeting pathname, or a user on
another computer system.

When you elect to review a mailing list, you are asked for the name of
one of your lists, unless you have only one, in which case that list is
chosen automatically.  If you type two question marks (??)  followed by
RETURN when you are asked for the name, you get a list of all your
mailing lists, and you can then select one from the displayed list.
This list is automatically displayed without a prompt, if you have set
the personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to yes.


:Info:  Process_Incoming_Mail:  Process Incoming Mail

This option enables you to read incoming mail.  The Incoming Mailbox
includes messages that have been sent to you since you last processed
your mail; it also includes messages that you left in the Incoming
Mailbox when you last read it.

After you choose this option, a new menu of choices is presented to
help you process the mail.


:Info:  Process_Filed_Mail:  Process Filed Mail

This option enables you to review the messages previously stored in one
of the mail files.  After selecting this option, you are asked for the
name of the mail file you wish to see, unless you have only one mail
file, in which case that one is chosen automatically.

If you type two question marks (??)  followed by RETURN when you are
asked for the file name, you get a list of all your mail files, and you
can then select a file from the displayed list.  This list is
automatically displayed without a prompt, if you have set the
personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to yes.

After the file name is chosen, you are given another menu from which
you can work on this mail file.


:Info:  Discard_Deferred_Msg:  Discard Deferred Message

This option enables you to discard a new message which was prepared and
then deferred.  After selecting this option, you are asked for the name
of the message you wish to discard.  At this point you can type two
question marks (??)  followed by RETURN to get a list of your deferred
messages, and you can then select a file from the displayed list.  This
list is automatically displayed without a prompt, if you have set the
personalize mail option "Display Lists As Menus" to yes.

To ensure that you do not discard a deferred message by mistake you are
asked to verify that you really wish to discard it.
