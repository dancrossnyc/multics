The Executive Mail system works with lists of operations called
"menus."  The list above is a menu to help you get started.  The items
in it (menu options) refer to explanations of certain basic parts of
Executive Mail.  To get one of these explanations, just type the number
of the wanted menu option.  You should start by going through all of
the options in this menu.  After going through the first six, select
number 7, and the menu titled "Executive Mail" is displayed.  You are
now ready to begin reading and writing mail.
