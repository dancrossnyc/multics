:Info:  F1:  F1 and ESC ?

Whenever the terminal cursor (the moving light that marks your place on
the screen) is in the upper portion of the screen (the menu), you can
get help by pressing function key F1 (or "ESC ?"  if you are using
escape sequences).  You are then asked what specific help you need.  If
you want help with an option in the above menu, type the number or
letter of that option but do NOT press RETURN.  If you want help with a
function key, press that function key (again do NOT press RETURN).  For
example, if you want help with function key F2, press F1, and at the
prompt, press F2.

If your terminal does not have function keys, or enough of them to
allow all the function operations, type the two character sequence
("ESC" followed by another character) that is used in place of the
particular function key you want.  In the above example, press and
release the ESC key followed by a question mark (?), and at the prompt,
press "ESC" and the letter "f".  Finally, if you want to know about
something other than a menu option or a function key, you can respond
to the prompt for the specific help desired, by typing two question
marks (??).  This provides a menu of general information items that you
can choose from.

Function keys 1 through 8 (F1-F8) operate in Executive Mail, but if
your terminal does not have them, you should press the "ESC" key
followed by either ?, f, p, q, r, l, h, or e to get the functions.  A
personalized mail option is available if you prefer to always use the
escape sequences, regardless of the capabilities of your terminal.  In
brief, the function keys operate as follows:


F1 (ESC ?)     provides help with menu options and function keys.
F2 (ESC f)     returns you to the first menu, the one called Executive
               Mail.
F3 (ESC p)     returns you to the previous menu.
F4 (ESC q)     gets you out of the Executive Mail facility.
F5 (ESC r)     redisplays the menu or menus on the screen.
F6 (ESC l)     enables you to look at the portion of a list that has
               scrolled off the top of your screen.
F7 (ESC h)     enables you to look at the portion of a list that is in
               the next screen, coming up from the bottom of your
               terminal.
F8 (ESC e)     enables you to execute a Multics command while working
               in Executive Mail.  In order to use this key or
               sequence, you must set the personalize mail option
               "Multics Command Mode" to yes.  You get back to the menu
               by typing "pi".

Pressing this function key or its associated escape sequence enables

part of the list.


:Info:  F8:  F8 and ESC e

Pressing this function key or its associated escape sequence enables
you to execute a Multics command while working in Executive Mail.
After you press this key or sequence, a ready message is displayed in
the lower portion of your screen, and you can now type a command line
just as you normally would at Multics command level.  As you issue
commands, the menu is scrolled off the top of the screen, allowing more
working space.  Type "pi" to get back to Executive Mail.

In order to use this function key or sequence, you must set the
personalize mail option "Multics Command Mode" to yes.
