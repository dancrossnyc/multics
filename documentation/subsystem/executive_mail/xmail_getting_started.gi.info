:Info:  Getting_to_Know_Your_Terminal:  Getting to Know Your Terminal

Your terminal has basically two parts, the screen and the keyboard.
The screen looks much like a television.  In Executive Mail, the
terminal screen is divided into two parts.  The upper portion contains
the menus you work from.  The lower portion displays explanations like
this one, messages sent to you, lists of various kinds, and the
messages that you write.

On your screen you will see a light that moves around.  As this
explanation was being displayed, this light moved ahead of each
character as it is displayed.  This light is in the form of a box or a
little line that moves under the lines of text.  This light is called
the "cursor," and it marks your current position on the screen.  When
it is in the menu portion of the screen, you can select one of the
options.  When it is in the lower portion of the screen, it marks the
place where anything you type will be displayed.

The keyboard is much like the keyboard on a typewriter, except that
there are a few extra keys.  The terminal keyboard, like standard
electric typewriter keyboards, has a carriage return key.  On some
keyboards it is labelled RETURN, on others CARRIAGE RETURN or CR, and
on yet other keyboards it is labelled ENTER.

One of the extra keys is the BREAK (or BRK) key.  It is often colored
red because it is a kind of alarm key that you press to signal Multics
to stop immediately and return the cursor to the menu.

Most, but not all terminals have a series of extra keys called function
keys.  These are usually located along the top of the keyboard and are
labeled F1, F2, etc.  These keys work in Executive Mail only when the
cursor is in the menu portion of the screen.  They perform special
functions in Executive Mail that you will learn about shortly.

To use function keys, Executive Mail requires your terminal to have at
least 7, 8 if you want to execute Multics commands while in the
Executive Mail system.  If your keyboard does not have function keys,
or enough of them, you can perform the function key operations by using
the key marked "ESC" in combination with other keys (e.g., "ESC q").
Anytime you want to operate the ESC key, press and immediately release
it, then type the key to be used in combination with it.  A personalize
mail option is available if you prefer to always use the escape
sequences, regardless of the capabilities of your terminal.

The last extra key you must learn is the one labelled "CTL".  Like the
ESC key, it is used in combination with other keys.  Unlike the ESC
key, the CTL key must be held down while typing the key to be used in
combination with it.


:Info:  How_to_Get_Help:  How to Get Help

The menu now displayed at the top of your screen provides the first
stage of help with Executive Mail.  It is the first menu available when
entering Executive Mail for the first time, although after this
session, the first menu seen upon reentering is the one titled
"Executive Mail."  One of the options in that menu enables you to get
the Getting Started menu, the one now being used, if you wish to go
through any part of it again.

When you are not working with the Getting Started menu, you can get
help in four ways.  The first is to use function key F1 (or "ESC ?"  if
you are using escape sequences).  The F1 key can be used whenever the
cursor is in the menu portion of the screen.  After pressing it, you
are asked what specifically you want help with.  If you want to know
what one of the options in the menu does, type its number or letter,
but do NOT press RETURN, and the explanation is displayed below the
menu.  To get an explanation of one of the function keys, press that
function key, (again, do not follow it with RETURN).  For example, if
you want help with function key F2, press F1, and at the prompt, press
F2.

If you inadvertently press RETURN when it is not called for, the system
responds with a beep to notify you that an unexpected action occurred.
Furthermore, if you inadvertently press RETURN while the system is
displaying, or getting ready to display a message, and the message
requires more than one screen to display, then you may find that some
data is lost (scrolled off the top of the screen).  In this case, you
would have to request the information a second time.

If your terminal does not have function keys, or enough of them, type
the two character escape sequence ("ESC" followed by another character)
that is used in place of the particular function key you want.  In the
above example, press and release the "ESC" key followed by a question
mark (?), and at the prompt, type "ESC f".  A personalize mail option
is available if you prefer to always use the escape sequences,
regardless of the capabilities of your terminal.  Finally, if you want
to know about something other than a menu option or a function key, how
to correct mistakes for example, you respond to the request for the
specific help desired by typing two question marks (??).  This provides
a menu of general information items from which the specific explanation
wanted can be chosen.

The second way of getting help is used when the cursor is not in the
menu portion of the screen.  Whenever you are asked to supply
information for a selected operation within a menu, you can type a
single question mark (?)  followed by RETURN to get an explanation of
exactly what it is you are being asked for.

You may also get help with the mail editor commands while editing mail
by entering the two character sequence, "ESC ?".  When using this
sequence, a summary of valid commands are displayed or you are prompted
to either enter the key sequence you want help with, for example "ESC
k", or enter a question mark (?)  to get a summary of the valid
commands.  The help information stays on the screen to allow time for
reading.  Use the two character sequence "CTL g" to return to editing.

Whenever you are asked to supply a forgotten name or number of some
item from a list previously created, you can display the complete list
by typing two question marks (??)  followed by RETURN.  Now you can
select an item from that list by typing the number or letter assigned
to it, just as you select an option from a menu.


:Info:  How_to_Get_Out:  How to Get Out

When you are ready to stop working in Executive Mail, press function
key F4 (or "ESC q", if you are using escape sequences).  Before you
execute this, be sure the cursor is in the menu portion of the screen.
Otherwise, pressing F4 ("ESC q") has no effect.

If the cursor is in the lower portion of the screen, you must move it
back to the menu before you can get out of Executive Mail.  You can
move the cursor back in two ways.  If you want to send or save a
message just typed, press the "ESC" key followed by the letter "q" or
the letter "t".  That sends the message or defers it and returns the
cursor to the menu portion of the screen.  If you are not typing a
message or do not care to send what has already been typed, press the
BREAK (or BRK) key to get back to the menu.


:Info:  Getting_Around:  Getting Around

There are seven menus in the Executive Mail system in addition to the
Getting Started menu displayed above.  When you enter the system, the
first menu displayed is "Executive Mail" (except the very first time
you use the system, in which case the Getting Started menu is displayed
first).  That menu lets you select all the other menus in the system,
including the Getting Started menu.

The other menus also contain options that let you choose to move to
another menu, though none of them contain options for all of the other
menus the way the Executive Mail menu does.  If you need to get back to
Executive Mail menu, you can do so by pressing function key F2 (or "ESC
f" if you are using escape sequences) while the cursor is in the menu
portion of the screen.

You can also move to the menu that was displayed just prior to the one
you are currently working in.  To do this, press function key F3 (or
"ESC p") while the cursor is in the menu portion of the screen.


:Info:  How_to_Correct_Typos:  How to Correct Typos

Typing mistakes are inevitable, so the Executive Mail system provides a
number of ways for you to change what was typed.

Whenever you are either typing a response to a prompt or entering
messages, you can move the cursor to different points in the text and
erase, change, or add to what was typed.  This is done with keystrokes
that use either the "ESC" or "CTL" key.  When using the CTL key, hold
it down while you type the associated character key.  When using the
ESC key, press and release it before typing the associated character
key.

Listed below are the keystrokes that can be used, both in changing a
response to a prompt and when working in the mail editor.  To get a
list of all the keystrokes that operate in the mail editor, ask for
general help after pressing the F1 key (or "ESC ?"  if you are using
escape sequences).  Now you can select information about the mail
editor.

CTL f     moves the cursor right one character.
ESC f     moves the cursor right one word.
CTL e     moves the cursor to the end of the line.
CTL a     moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
CTL b     moves the cursor left one character.
ESC b     moves the cursor left one word.
CTL d     deletes the one character the cursor is under or covering.
ESC d     deletes one word to the right of the cursor.
BACKSPACE deletes one character to the left of the cursor (the DEL key
          also does this).
ESC BACKSPACE deletes one word to the left of the cursor (ESC DEL also
          does this).
CTL k     erases all text between the cursor and the end of the line.
@         erases all text between the cursor and the beginning of the
          line.
CTL Y     retrieves any piece of erased text, longer than one
          character, and inserts it at the current cursor position.


:Info:  Personalizing_Executive_Mail:  Personalizing Executive Mail

This option lets you set many aspects of Executive Mail to work the way
you want them to.  After you choose this option, a new menu of choices
is presented to help you select and set each of the personalization
options.  You can set these options, or leave them at their default
settings, and have them work each time you use Executive Mail.

You can get to the Personalize Executive Mail menu from the Executive
Mail menu.
