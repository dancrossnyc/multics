Arguments:
flagbox_variable
   is one of the valid flagbox variables listed below:
   N
      where N is from 1 to 36.  The returned value is the Nth flagbox
      flag.  These flags have true or false values.  Some of them are
      named and can be referred to by their names, as listed below.
   auto_reboot
      (also flag 1).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.  Refer to the
      Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81,
      for more details.
   booting
      (also flag 2).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.


   rebooted
      (also flag 4).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.
   unattended
      (also flag 5).  Used by the auto BCE exec_com.
   bce_command
      a command that is invoked by BCE whenever it reaches a command
      level.  The result is a character string, quoted.  This command
      may be set so that BCE can be set to automatically boot Multics
      upon a crash, etc.  Refer to the Multics System Maintenance
      Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for more details.
   ssenb
      a flag set by Multics indicating whether or not the storage
      system was enabled at the time of a crash.  A value of true
      indicates that an emergency shutdown needs to be performed (or
      did not succeed).


   call_bce
      indicates that BCE was called through a program calling call_bce.
      This may be the result of the user having entering the bce
      command.
   shut
      indicates that Multics successfully shut down.  If neither shut
      nor call_bce is set, Multics either encountered a breakpoint,
      crashed or was manually brought to BCE.
   manual_crash
      indicates that BCE was invoked manually, either by the user
      manually forcing a return to BCE (XED 24000) or by the user
      hitting the EXECUTE FAULT button.
value
   is either a character string (for the bce_command variable) or the
   string "true" or "false" (for other flagbox variables).
