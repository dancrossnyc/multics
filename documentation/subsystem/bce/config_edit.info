04/05/85  config_edit, config

Syntax as a command:  config {file_name}


Function:  enters the config deck editor.  This editor is identical in
function to the qedx text editor, except that buffer 0 contains a copy
(in ASCII source form) of the config deck.  This command is not valid
at the "crash" command level.


Arguments:
file_name
   is the name of a file to be read into the config deck.


Notes:  If a file_name is supplied on the command line, the specified
file is read into the config deck without entering the config deck
editor.

If a file_name is not supplied, the current config deck (that found in
the CONF partition on the RPV) is read into buffer 0.  It is converted
to a labeled ASCII form which is an expanded form of that used in the
configuration card description section.  Arbitrary text editing
operations may be performed on this buffer, as well as any other.
Performing a w (write) request on buffer 0 writes the edited buffer
back into the config deck.


The read (r) and write (w) requests (when used with a file name) may be
used to insert a file into the copy of the config deck or to make a
copy of the config deck in a file, respectively.  When used with a file
name, these two requests do not change the default file name of
config_edit's copy of the config deck.  When used without a file name,
these two requests always refer to config_edit's copy of the config
deck.

The qedx request line 1,$dr can be used to restore the original config
deck if no write request has been performed.  If a write request has
been performed, this request line will only discard those changes made
since the most recent write.


In the labeled format, each field on a config card, except for the card
name, may be optionally preceded by a label.  Labeled fields may appear
in any order.  The interpretation of a card in labeled form is that all
labeled fields are placed into their proper places; any unlabeled
fields then fill in the missing spaces.  Thus,

      iom -state on -port 1 a nsa

becomes

      iom a 1 nsa on

in its standard format.


The various labeled formats are described in the Multics System
Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81.  If a card is to be
entered whose format has been locally changed or whose format or type
is otherwise unknown, a "."  may be placed in front of the card name to
avoid errors during parsing of the card.  Such a card may not have any
labeled fields.

Refer to the discussion under "Config Deck and Device Accessibility" in
the Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for
details on the implications of the use of this command.

See the description of the qedx command in the Multics Commands and
Active Functions manual, Order No.  AG92, for complete information on
qedx requests and their options.
