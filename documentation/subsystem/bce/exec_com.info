04/05/85  exec_com, ec

Syntax as a command:  ec path {optional_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [ec path {optional_args}]


Function:  invokes a BCE exec_com.  An exec_com is an ASCII file
consisting of a series of commands to invoke.  BCE uses exec_com
version 1, described in the Multics Commands and Active Functions
manual, Order No.  AG92.  For complete information, see that manual.
This command is valid at all BCE command levels.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment containing commands to be executed and
   control statements to be interpreted.  The entryname of the segment
   must have the ec suffix, although the suffix can be omitted in the
   command invocation.  If an entryname only is specified, i.e., one
   containing no < or > characters, the exec_com search list is used to
   locate the segment.
optional_args
   are character strings to be substituted for special strings in the
   exec_com segment.


Notes:  When the boot, bce, continue or reinitialize command is
executed by a runnning BCE exec_com, the exec_com is aborted.
