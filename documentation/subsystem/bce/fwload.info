09/25/86  fwload, fw

Syntax as a command:  fw mpc_name {...  mpc_names}


Function:  loads firmware into the specified MPCs.  It scans the config
deck to determine the location of the MPC and the type of peripherals
involved to determine the firmware and overlays needed.  This command
is not valid at the BCE "early" command level.


Arguments:
mpc_name
   is the name of an MPC into which firmware is to be loaded.


Notes:  This command can be used on disk MPCs only if they are fully
crossbarred.

Noncrossbarred disk MPCs must be loaded as part of BCE
initialization or by use of the "reinitialize (reinit)" BCE command.
