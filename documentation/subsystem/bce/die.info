04/05/85 die

Syntax as a command:  die {-control_arg}


Function:  aborts all BCE activities.  This command wipes out the BCE
toehold, preventing any returns to BCE, manual or otherwise.  It should
be used only when you want to absolutely destroy any remnants of BCE.
This command is valid at all BCE command levels.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   destroys BCE without querying you first.  If this control argument
   is not used, the die command asks you if BCE should really be
   destroyed before it destroys it.
