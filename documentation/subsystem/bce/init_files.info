04/05/85 init_files

Syntax as a command:  init_files {-control_arg}


Function:  wipes out all files in the BCE file system.  It is to be
used only if a problem is encountered with the BCE file system.  This
command is valid at all BCE command levels.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   clears the BCE file system without querying you first.  If this
   control argument is not used, the init_files command asks you if the
   BCE file system should really be cleared before it clears it.


Notes:  Refer to the Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual,
Order No.  AM81, for information on reloading the BCE file system after
it has been initialized.
