04/05/85  emergency_shutdown, esd

Syntax as a command:  esd


Function:  starts an emergency shutdown of Multics.  It is only valid
at the "crash" command level.  It should be used whenever the system
crashes to prevent storage system damage.  Performing an emergency
shutdown destroys the saved crash image and should therefore only be
done after a dump is taken.
