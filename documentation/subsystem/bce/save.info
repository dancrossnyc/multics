07/21/87  save


Syntax as a command:
     save {-set} CF_1 {... CF_N} {-set CF_1 {... CF_N}}
          {-restart_set CF_1 {... CF_N}}


Function:  used to save the contents of physical volumes on tape.  It
can be used only at BCE (boot) command level.


Arguments:
CF_1 {...  CF_N}
   defines the name of a control file or set of control files that will
   makeup a save set.  See "List of control file requests" below.  At
   least one and up to 32 control file names may be defined per save.

   A control file cannot be specified multiple times for a given set,
   but can be specified in more than one set.  This can be used to save
   a set of volumes to several sets of tapes at one time.


Control arguments:
-set
   used to prefix a set of control file names.  The first set of
   control files do not require this prefix, but it is acceptable.  Up
   to four control file sets may be defined.  This may be used in
   combination with the -restart_set control argument.

-restart_set, -restart, -rt
   used to prefix a set of control file names that are to be restarted.
   This may be used in combination with the -set control argument.


List of control file requests:
tape_set [tape_set_name],
ts [tape_set_name]
   where "tape_set_name" is the name of the collection of tapes that
   are to be used for the save.  The name can be up to 32 characters.
   There must be one of these requests per set.  Names might be defined
   by the color of the tape reel (e.g.  the "blue" set or the "red"
   set).  This name becomes part of the tape label of each tape and is
   checked during a restore.  This name will also appear in parenthesis
   after the program name in all output messages.

tape_device [tape_device] {density},
td [tape_device] {density}
   where "tape_device" is the standard device identifier (i.e.
   tapa_05) and "density" is in the form "d=NNNN", "den=NNNN",
   "-density NNNN", "-den NNNN" or "-d NNNN".  The default density will
   be 6250 bpi.  The order the devices are entered defines the sequence
   for using them.  Up to 16 devices can be defined per save set.

physical_volume [pv_name] [disk_device] {-all},
pv [pv_name] [disk_device] {-all}
   where "pv_name" is the name of the physical volume to be saved.  The
   "disk_device" would be the standard name "dska_02" or "dske_02c" for
   sub-volumes.  The "-all" argument specifies that all the vtoc and
   paging records should be saved, instead of just saving the paging
   records that are in use.  This also occurs if the volume requires
   salvaging.  The "-all" arg has no meaning while doing a restore.  Up
   to 63 volumes can be saved per set.

partition [pv_name] [disk_device] [part_name] {...  part_name},
part [pv_name] [disk_device] [part_name] {...  part_name}
   where "pv_name" and "disk_device" are as described in the "pv"
   request.  "part_name" is the name of the partition to be saved or
   "-all" to save all the defined partitions.  The RPV partition "bce"
   or any "hc" or "alt" partitions will not be allowed to be saved.  If
   the RPV partitions "conf", "file" or "log" are not specified, when
   saving the RPV, a message will be displayed that will state that
   they are not being saved, just in case the operator really wishes to
   have them saved.  Up to 7 partitions may be defined per volume.  Up
   to 64 partitions may be defined per save set.

control_file [control_file],
cf [control_file]
   where "control_file" defines another control file to be examined.
   This enables control files to be linked together.  For instance ONE
   control file could define all the tape devices for the save.  The
   other control files could be broken down into logical volumes that
   only reference the tape device control file and then define the
   physical volumes.  Up to 32 control file names may be defined per
   save.


Notes on control file requests:  Only one request may be given per
line.  Any lines in a control file that begin with /, & or " are
treated as comments.  All white space prior to a request in a line is
trimmed.

Partitions on a physical volume can be saved without having to save the
vtoc and paging regions by only defining a partition request.

The control files can be edited using the BCE qedx request, or edited
while the system is running and updated in the file partition by either
using bootload_fs or regeneration of the MST.


Notes on save:  When a save set is complete it is necessary to write
one last tape, called the "Info" tape, that will contain information
used during a restore to quickly locate the tapes that items are on.


Notes on operator interrupts:  A save can be interrupted by use of the
console "request" key.  When depressed while a save is in progress, the
message "save:  Abort request:" will appear.  The operator will be
required to input one of the following responses.

no, n
   This causes the program to ignore the request and resume the save.

abort
   This causes the program to abort the entire save and return to BCE
   command level.

restart TAPE_SET
   This allows the operator to restart the specified TAPE_SET, using
   its current tape device.  The operator is then required to mount the
   "restart" tape on the device, which is either the last good tape
   written or the current tape (as long as the tape label has been
   written).  Once the SET has been restarted, the remaining SETs will
   continue operation.

stop TAPE_SET
   This causes the program to abort the specified TAPE_SET, by marking
   it complete, and resume the save of the other sets.

help, ?
   This causes the program to display the above possible responses,
   with a small description of each.


Notes on tape error recovery:  During a save there are times when
errors occur which require special handling.  Retries of write errors
are done by either doing a backspace and erase followed by the
original write or a rewind and set density followed by the original
write when an error occurs at the beginning of the tape.  If unable to
write the data after eight retries the error becomes unrecoverable.

When an unrecoverable error occurs a message will be displayed that
shows the error interpreted in english, with detailed status in hex if
required.  The operator will be queried as to the course of action that
the program should take.  Listed below is an example error output and
the possible responses and their meanings.


 0319.4  save(blue): Device Attention, Handler check on tapa_12.
         detailed status: 20 8C 2B 6D 0A 01 16 00 00 16 48 87 24
                          18 06 00 00 0C 00 00 08 08 80 00 00 00
   save: Action:

abort
   This causes the program to abort the entire save and return to BCE
   command level.

retry, r
   For errors that are retryable this will force the retry process to
   be redone.  It is invalid for non-retryable errors.

stop_set, stop
   This will cause this SET to be aborted, but all other SETs will
   continue.

restart_set, restart, rt
   This allows the operator to restart this SET, using the current tape
   device.  The operator is then required to mount the "restart" tape
   on the device.  Once the SET has been restarted, the remaining SETs
   will continue operation.

remove_device_from_set, remove
   Works like the "restart_set" request above, but removes the current
   tape device from the SET and sequences to the next device before
   going through the restart process.  This is not a valid response if
   this is the only tape device left in the SET.

help, ?
   This causes the program to display the above possible responses,
   with a small description of each.
