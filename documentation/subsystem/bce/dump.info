04/25/86  dump

Syntax as a command:
   dump {macro_keyword} {-process_group segment_option
   {...segment_options}} {-control_args}


Function: produces a diagnostic dump of system memory and tables after
a hardware or software failure, for later analysis.  The dump is
produced by copying binary images of segments and directories into the
DUMP partition of the disk described by the part dump config card.
Arguments to the dump command specify which processes are to be
examined and which segments from those processes are to be dumped.
(See "Notes" for a general purpose command line.)  This command is
valid at all BCE command levels.


Arguments:
macro_keyword
   specifies one of the following default group of processes and
   segments to dump.
   -brief, -bf
      is equivalent to -run hc pp moddir.
   -long, -lg
      is equivalent to -all wrt.
   -standard, -std
      is equivalent to -run hc pp moddir -elig hc stk -inzr hc stk.


process_group
   specifies a group of processes to be considered for dumping.  The
   segments that get dumped for processes in this group are specified
   by segment options that follow the process group keyword.  Allowed
   groups are:
   -all
      all processes
   -eligible, -elig
      all running and eligible processes (processes being considered
      for running)
   -initializer, -inzr
      the initializer process (first apte entry)
   -running, -run
      processes running on a processor (apte.state = running or
      stopped)


segment_option
   specifies a class of segments to be dumped for the group of
   processes specified by the process group keyword.  Segment classes
   are:
   directories, dir
      directory segments (aste.dirsw = "1"b)
   hardcore, hc
      the pds, kst, dseg and ring 0 stack for the process(es).  If a
      process is running, this also dumps the prds for the processor in
      question.
   modifying_dirs, moddir
      directory segments (aste.dirsw = "1"b) which were being modified
      at the time of the crash (dir.modify ^= "0"b)


   per_process, pp
      the segments contained within the process directory of the
      process(es) (aste.per_process = "1"b)
   stacks, stk
      all stack segments in the process(es) not already dumped by the
      hc or pp keywords.
   writeable, wrt
      all segments to which the process(es) have write access.  This
      keyword produces a very large dump.


   Writable ring zero segments (system data bases) other than
   directories are dumped regardless of what keywords are specified.

   Prefixing a segment option with a circumflex (^) reverts an earlier
   occurence of the given segment option.  Thus, you can turn on a
   macro_keyword and turn off a specific segment option within it.


Control arguments:
-bce
   dumps BCE itself (the dumper).
-crash
   specifies that BCE is to dump the saved Multics image.
-drive, -dv drive_name
   places the dump into the dump partition of the specified drive
   instead of the drive listed on the PART DUMP card.
-dump #
   changes the dump number to a desired value.  By default, dumps are
   assigned numbers sequentially.


-force, -fc
   places the dump into the DUMP partition without querying you first,
   even if this means that an existing dump which hasn't been copied
   will be overwritten.  If this control argument is not used, the dump
   command asks you if the existing dump should really be overwritten
   before it overwrites it.
-no_sstnt
   disables sst_names_ generation.  If sst_names_ generation is enabled
   for the system ( by the astk parm in the config deck), this control
   argument has no effect.


-sstnt
   causes the segment sst_names_ (the sst name table) to be filled in
   and included in the dump.  The segment sst_names_ provides a name
   for each ASTE in the system.  This information is of use to dump
   analysis programs.  If sst_names_ generation is enabled for the
   system (by the astk parm in the config deck), this control argument
   has no effect.  This is the default.


Notes: For general purpose dump analysis, the command line
   dump -std
which is equivalent to
   dump -run hc pp moddir -elig hc stk -inzr hc stk
should give the user all of the useful processes and segments (to
produce a smaller dump, remove the "moddir" keyword).  For simplicity,
and to remove the possibility of operator error, this command line
should be placed into a BCE exec_com, either by itself or in a site
supplied crash exec_com.


The dump command examines the active process table entries (apte)
within the specified image.  For each entry, the criteria specified
through the keywords are used to decide if any segments from this
process are to be dumped.  If any segments are to be dumped, the
segment options are applied to each segment active within that process
to decide whether or not they should be dumped.  As each process is
dumped, the dump command will produce an output line showing the apte
number and the dbr value for the process.  After scanning all apte
entries, if the process in control when Multics crashed was not one of
the processes dumped, it is dumped with a status line showing an apte
number of zero.  This process is dumped with the running and
initializer segment options.


A counter and a valid flag are kept within the DUMP partition.  When a
dump is placed into the partition, the valid flag is set.  It is reset
when the dump is copied out during Multics service (by the copy_dump
exec command).  If the dump in the partition has not been copied, the
dump command will ask you if it should be overwritten.  You can avoid
this query by specifying the -force (-fc) control argument.
The dump command provides a severity indicator, indicating the
successful of its operation.  This indicator may be obtained with the
severity command/active function.  The interpretation of the severity
status is:
   3 - the dump request was never called.
   2 - the dump request was entered, but never completed.
   1 - the dump was aborted because the DUMP partition contains
          an older dump.
   0 - the dump was successfully generated.
