04/05/85  reinitialize, reinit

Syntax as a command:  reinit {-control_arg}


Function:  causes BCE to perform a new initialization pass, thereby
reflecting any changes to the config deck made since the last such
pass.  This command returns the operator to "boot" command level.  It
is valid at the "boot," "bce_crash" and "crash" command levels.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   when used at the "crash" command level, destroys the saved Multics
   image without querying you first.  If this control argument is not
   used, the reinitialize command asks you if the saved Multics image
   should really be destroyed before it destroys it.
