07/21/87  restore


Syntax as a command:
     restore {-set} CF_1 {... CF_N} {-set CF_1 {... CF_N}}
             {-restart_set CF_1 {... CF_N}}
   or
     restore -display_info_tape TAPE_DEVICE


Function:  used to restore the contents of physical volumes from tape.
It can be used only at BCE (boot) command level.


Arguments:
CF_1 {...  CF_N}
   defines the name of a control file or set of control files that will
   makeup a restore set.  See "List of control file requests" below.
   At least one and up to 32 control file names may be defined per
   restore.

TAPE_DEVICE
   defines the device which should be used to read the "Info" tape
   (e.g.  tapa_01).


Control arguments:
-display_info_tape, -dit
   used to display the information contained on the "Info" tape, which
   is the last tape written as part of the save process.  This argument
   should not be used in combination with any other control arguments.

-set
   used to prefix a set of control file names.  The first set of
   control files do not require this prefix, but it is acceptable.  Up
   to four control file sets may be defined.  This may be used in
   combination with the -restart_set control argument.

-restart_set, -restart, -rt
   used to prefix a set of control file names that are to be restarted.
   This may be used in combination with the -set control argument.


List of control file requests:
tape_set [tape_set_name],
ts [tape_set_name]
   where "tape_set_name" is the name of the collection of tapes that
   are to be used for the restore.  The name can be up to 32
   characters.  There must be one of these requests per set.  Names
   might be defined by the color of the tape reel (e.g.  the "blue" set
   or the "red" set).  This name is part of the tape label and is
   checked during at each tape mount.  This name will also appear in
   parenthesis after the program name in all output messages.

tape_device [tape_device] {density},
td [tape_device] {density}
   where "tape_device" is the standard device identifier (i.e.
   tapa_05) and "density" is in the form "d=NNNN", "den=NNNN",
   "-density NNNN", "-den NNNN" or "-d NNNN".  The density is only
   needed during a save.  During a restore the save tape will define
   the density.  The order the devices are entered defines the sequence
   for using them.  Up to 16 devices can be defined per restore set.

physical_volume [pv_name] [disk_device],
pv [pv_name] [disk_device]
   where "pv_name" is the name of the physical volume to be restored.
   The "disk_device" would be the standard name "dska_02" or "dske_02c"
   for sub-volumes.  Up to 63 volumes can be restored per set.

partition [pv_name] [disk_device] [part_name] {...  part_name},
part [pv_name] [disk_device] [part_name] {...  part_name}
   where "pv_name" and "disk_device" are as described in the "pv"
   request.  "part_name" is the name of the partition to be restored or
   "-all" to restore all the partitions that were saved.  If "-all" is
   specified then all partitions defined on the volume that are not
   restored will be zero filled, except for any "alt" or "hc"
   partitions and the "bce" partition on the rpv.  Up to 64 partitions
   may be defined per restore set.

control_file [control_file],
cf [control_file]
   where "control_file" defines another control file to be examined.
   This enables control files to be linked together.  For instance ONE
   control file could define all the tape devices for the restore.  The
   other control files could be broken down into logical volumes that
   only reference the tape device control file and then define the
   physical volumes.  Up to 32 control file names may be defined per
   restore.


Notes on control file requests:  Only one request may be given per
line.  Any lines in a control file that begin with /, & or " are
treated as comments.  All white space prior to a request in a line is
trimmed before processing.

Partitions on a physical volume can be restored without having to
restore the vtoc and paging regions by only defining a partition
request.  This can also be used to copy a partition from one volume to
another, even of different types.

The control files can be edited using the BCE qedx request, or edited
while the system is running and updated in the file partition by either
using bootload_fs or regeneration of the MST.


Notes on restore:  The first tape read during a restore is always the
"Info" tape, which was the last tape written when the set was saved.
This gives the restore information necessary to properly locate items
without wasting time spinning tape.


Notes on operator interrupts:  A restore can be interrupted by use of
the console "request" key.  When depressed while a restore is in
progress, the message "restore:  Abort request:" will appear.  The
operator will be required to input one of the following responses.

no, n
   This causes the program to ignore the request and resume the
   restore.

abort
   This causes the program to abort the entire restore and return to
   BCE command level.

restart TAPE_SET
   This allows the operator to restart the specified TAPE_SET, using
   its current tape device.  The operator is then required to mount the
   "restart" tape on the device, which is the tape that the operator
   wishs to restart from.  Once the SET has been restarted, the
   remaining SETs will continue operation.

stop TAPE_SET
   This causes the program to abort the specified TAPE_SET, by marking
   it complete, and resume the restore of the other sets.

help, ?
   This causes the program to display the above possible responses,
   with a small description of each.


Notes on tape error recovery:  During a restore there are times when
errors occur which require special handling.  Read data errors are
retried by the program up to eight times.  If unable to read the data,
the error becomes unrecoverable.  The recovery procedure will be
selected by the operator.  One choice would be to perform the retry
attempts again.  Another would be to skip this record and try to read
the next.  The full list of possibilities are listed below.

When an unrecoverable error occurs a message will be displayed that
shows the error interpreted in english, with detailed status in hex if
required.  The operator will be queried as to the course of action that
the program should take.  Listed below is an example error output and
the possible responses and their meanings.


 0423.6  restore(blue): Device Attention, Handler check on tapa_12.
         detailed status: 20 8C 2B 6D 0A 01 16 00 00 16 48 87 24
                          18 06 00 00 0C 00 00 08 08 80 00 00 00
   restore: Action:

abort
   This causes the program to abort the entire restore and return to
   BCE command level.

retry, r
   For errors that are retryable this will force the retry process to
   be redone.  It is invalid for non-retryable errors.

skip, s
   This is only valid for unrecoverable data alert errors detected
   while doing a restore.  The unreadable record is skipped and the
   program continues by attempting to read the next record.

stop_set, stop
   This will cause this SET to be aborted, but all other SETs will
   continue.

restart_set, restart, rt
   This allows the operator to restart this SET, using the current tape
   device.  The operator is then required to mount the "restart" tape
   on the device.  Once the SET has been restarted, the remaining SETs
   will continue operation.

remove_device_from_set, remove
   Works like the "restart_set" request above, but removes the current
   tape device from the SET and sequences to the next device before
   going through the restart process.  This is not a valid response if
   this is the only tape device left in the SET.

help, ?
   This causes the program to display the above possible responses,
   with a small description of each.
