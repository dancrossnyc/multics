11/13/84  kermit request: get

Syntax:  get remote_source_path {local_destination_path}


Function:  sends a request to the remote server requesting the named
   files be sent by the remote system.


Arguments:

remote_source_path
   is the pathname of the file to be sent by the remote system.  Its
   syntax must be acceptable to the remote system.  The star convention
   is allowed, but its meaning is dependent on the remote system.

local_destination_path
   is the pathname under which the incoming file will be stored on 
   the local system.  If local_destination_path is specified when
   receiving a file group from the remote system, the first file
   received will be stored under the given path, and the remainder
   will be stored under their own names.


Notes:
   The get request requires that the remote server be operating.  If
the named file(s) cannot be sent, the remote system will inform the
local system and give a reason.
