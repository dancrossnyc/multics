Syntax as a command:  pmf path


Function:  edits a PMF (for an undelegated project) with the qedx
editor, converts the edited PMF to a PDT, and installs the PDT.  It
first puts the administrator into the qedx editor after reading in the
segment and allows him to make any changes he wants.  After the
administrator exits from qedx, the command converts the PMF to a PDT
and signals the initializer to install the PDT.  The command takes care
of updating the pmf.archive segment (in the >udd>SysAdmin>admin
directory) as well.  See the qedx Text Editor User's Guide manual,
Order No.  CG40) for details on use of the qedx command.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the PMF to be edited.
