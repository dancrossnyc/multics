Syntax as a command:  word login_word {message}


Function:  can be used to change either the login word or the dialup
buffer typed out when a user dials up, or both.  This command can be
used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
login_word
   is a new login word that is set and must be given by users in order
   to log in.  If the login word is set to shutdown, no users are
   allowed to log in.  If a user dials up in this case, he is told that
   the system is shutting down, and his terminal is hung up
   immediately.
message
   is a message string to which the dialup buffer is set.  The message
   argument may be omitted; if it is, and if login_word is "login," the
   message buffer is reset; if login_word is "shutdown," the message
   buffer is set to "Multics is shutting down"; if login_word is
   anything else, the message buffer is set to "Special session in
   progress."
