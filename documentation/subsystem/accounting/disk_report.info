03/04/85  disk_report, drp, disk_auto

Syntax as a command:  drp, disk_auto


Function:  calculates disk usage and creates a disk usage report.  The
administrator can invoke the disk_report command to cause a manual disk
usage calculation.  Normally, though, disk usage is calculated
automatically every night by the absentee job, dodrp.absin, that
executes the disk_auto command.


Notes:  The sweep program is used to get quota for all directories into
the disk_stat data segment (in >udd>SysAdmin>admin).  The charge_disk
program then charges these usage figures to projects in their
"projfile" entries.  A printable segment, called diskreport, is
produced but not automatically printed.  To print copies of this
segment, type "rqm diskreport".  See the rqm command.

This command examines a large fraction of all the directories in the
hierarchy, placing a heavy load on the system.  Its use during peak
load hours should be avoided if possible.
