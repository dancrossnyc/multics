03/04/85 day

Syntax as a command:  day


Function:  prints the output from the crank on the terminal and asks
whether or not to delete the output.  (Every night, a self-rescheduling
absentee job called the "crank" is run.  It records the daily charges
of users and checks for users who should be cut off.)  Unless there was
an error, the absentee output segment should be deleted.
