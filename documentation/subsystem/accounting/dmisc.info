Function:  deletes charges from the miscfile.  For each transaction,

input items for a transaction can be put on the same line or they can
be supplied one at a time.  To exit from this command, type "x" instead
of a Project_id.  Charges and credits are made to the miscfile using
the charge and credit commands, respectively.
