03/04/85 delegate

Syntax as a command:  delegate Project_id path User_id


Function:  gives a project administrator control over a project's PMF.
Once this is done, the project administrator can add and delete users
and set resource-usage limits on users in the project.  There may be up
to four project administrators for the project.

The delegate command edits the SAT to show that a project administrator
can install PDTs for a particular project.  It also sets access on the
proj_admin_seg segment (in the >sc1 directory) and the >sc1>update
directory so the project administrator can install his PDT.


A delegated project is under control of the project administrator only.
The accounting administrator receives an error message if he attempts
to execute the add_anon, dpmf, upmf, or pmf commands on a delegated
project.  The accounting administrator can use the undelegate command
if he wishes to take a project back from a project administrator, in
order to have the project under his control, or to delegate it to some
new project administrator.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project to be assigned a project
   administrator.
path
   is the pathname of the directory in which the PMF is placed.  This
   pathname is usually the pathname of the project directory.
User_id
   is the User_id, specified as Person_id.Project_id, of the project
   administrator.
