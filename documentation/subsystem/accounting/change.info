Syntax as a command:  change {Person_id} {item}} {new_value}


Function:  review and possibly modify user registration data in the URF
and PNT.  Each item is typed out.  The administrator can leave the item
unchanged by typing a carriage return, or he can replace the item by
typing new data.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of a user whose registration data is to be changed.
   If it is omitted, the change command asks for it.
item
   is the item to be changed.  If it is omitted, every item is
   displayed and a new value is requested.  Item can only be given if
   Person_id is given.  Item may be any one of the following keywords:
   addr
      User's mailing address
   cpass
      card input password
   name
      full name (Last First I.:  title)


   notes
      any miscellaneous information
   proj
      default project
   pass
      login password
   progn
      programmer number
new_value
   is the new value for item.  If it is omitted, the old value is
   displayed and a new value is requested.


Notes:  The chaddr, chalias, chcpass, chdf_proj, chname, chpass, and
chprog commands can be used to change some of the individual items in
the PNT and avoid the need to type the item name or to be prompted for
new values of all items.

The user's last name can be a maximum of 32 characters.  The field for
the user's first name and middle initial can be a maximum of 24
characters.  The user's name should be given last name first, then a
comma, the first name, a space, and then middle initial followed by a
period.  Names of the form "Smith, J.  Alfred" are also allowed.  If
the user has a title (e.g., Prof., Capt., Dr.), the title (maximum of 8
characters) should follow the name and be separated from the name by a
colon, for example:

      Smith,John J.:Prof.


The address field can be a maximum of 32 characters; slashes can be
used to separate lines of an address.

The programmer number and default project ID can be a maximum of 32 and
9 characters, respectively.

Notes can be a maximum of 32 characters.  This field can hold
miscellaneous information such as phone number, additional address
information, position within the organization, etc.


The password and card input password can be from one through eight
ASCII printing characters, including backspace, but excluding space and
semicolon.  "HELP", "help", "quit", and "?"  are interpreted uniquely
by the password processor and are therefore unacceptable as password
specifications for an interactive login.  A response of either a blank
line or an asterisk ("*") will leave the password unchanged.

The accounting administrator can type "stop" at any time to abort all
the changes he has made for a particular user and start over.
