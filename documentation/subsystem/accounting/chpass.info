03/04/85 chpass

Syntax as a command:  chpass Person_id


Function:  changes the password for a single user.  It changes the
user's password in the PNT found in >sc1.  Thus, even if the user has
changed his password with the -change_password control argument to the
login command, the chpass command overrides the user's change.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose password is to be changed.


Notes:  A password may consist of from one through eight ASCII printing
characters including backspace, but excluding space and semicolon.

"HELP", "help", "quit", and "?"  are interpreted uniquely by the
password processor and are therefore unacceptable as password
specifications for an interactive login.  Entering "quit" terminates
the login attempt, while "HELP", "help", or "?"  results in an
explanatory message and repeat of the password prompt.
