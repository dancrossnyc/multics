Arguments:
project
   is the project_id of the project whose registration data items are
   to be edited.  If this is the only argument specified, edit_proj
   prints each data item one at a time and waits for a response from
   the accounting administrator before proceeding.  The accounting
   administrator may respond with any one of the following:
   carriage return
      to leave the item unchanged.
   a new value
      to replace the printed value.
   stop
      to exit immediately from the edit_proj command without making any
      changes.
