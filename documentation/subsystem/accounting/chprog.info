03/04/85 chprog

Syntax as a command:  chprog Person_id {prog_no}


Function:  changes the programmer number for one user.  The programmer
number must be all numeric.  It can be up to sixteen characters long.
(Some installations use the employee number assigned by the company in
this field.)  If the new programmer number is not supplied, the old
value is displayed and a change is accepted.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose programmer number is to be
   changed.
prog_no
   is the new programmer number.  If this argument is omitted, the
   chprog command prints the old programmer number and then waits for
   the accounting administrator to either enter the new programmer
   number of a null line (to retain the old number).
