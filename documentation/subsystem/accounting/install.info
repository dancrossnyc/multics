Syntax as a command:  install path


Function:  installs a system table.  Many of the other commands
described in this manual that modify system tables also automatically
install them.  Therefore, this command should only be used after a
command whose documentation indicates that a system table is modified
but not installed or when an operation that usually installs a system
table is interrupted by a system failure before it can do so.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the system table to be installed or is one of the
   following keywords, sat or smf.cur.sat.  These keywords invoke the
   daily_summary command before the SAT is installed.

   If any other pathname is given, the specified system table is
   installed as described in the privileged Multics install command
   found in Section 2 of Multics Administration, Maintenance, and
   Operations Commands manual, Order No. GB64.
