For each meeting selected, information about the names of the meeting
and per-user meeting attributes are listed.


Arguments:
meeting_names
   are optional meeting_names. If any are supplied, information about
   only the specified meeting_names is printed.  The star convention is

   information for all meetings found in the 'forum' search path
   will be printed.

   default is to print information about the meetings in which the user
   is eligible to participate only.

   selects meetings which have not changed since the specified time.
   DATE_TIME is any string acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_

   select all meetings which match the specified starname.

   format and errors encountered while searching for meetings are not
   to be printed. (Default)
