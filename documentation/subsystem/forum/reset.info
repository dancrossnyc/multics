10/20/82  forum request:  reset, rs

Syntax:  rs {trans_spec}  {-control_arg}


Function:
Resets the user's "current" or "highest transaction seen" index to
the specified transaction number.  The "highest transaction seen"
is only maintained for pre-MR11 version meetings.  For current version
meetings, seen switches should be used.  Type "help switch_on" or
"help switch_off" for more information.

Argument:
trans_specs
   is a transaction specifier which determines the value of the transaction
   number that the index will be reset to.  Only one transaction specifier
   may be given.  Type "help trans_specs" for information on transaction
   specifiers.


Control arguments:
-current
   sets the current transaction index to be the specified transaction.
   (Default)
-highest
   sets the highest seen transaction index to the specified transaction.
   This control argument only applies to pre-MR11 version meetings.


-new
   makes the specified transaction the first "new" transaction. This is
   equivalent to "reset -highest trans_num-1".  This control argument
   only applies to pre-MR11 version meetings.
-next
   makes the specified transaction the "next" transaction. This is the
   same as "reset trans_num-1".


Notes: 

The "current transaction index" is a logical pointer to a transaction in a
meeting.  Many forum requests, including print and write, use the value of
this index if no transaction specifiers are supplied.  It is initially set to
the value of the"non_deleted last_seen transaction" when the user enters a
meeting.  The "non_deleted last_seen transaction" index is a logical pointer
to the non_delete highest numbered transaction that the user has listed,
printed or written to a segment.  This index is used when detemining which
transactions are 'new'.
