5/31/86  forum_request:  next_meeting, nm

Syntax:  nm {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active request:  [nm {-control_arg}]


Function:  changes the current meeting to be the next meeting in the
list of changed meetings established by the check_meetings request.
As an active function, it returns the name of the next meeting on the
list. In either case, that meeting is removed from the list.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   Prints or returns a list of all of the meetings in the list of
   changed meetings, including those already visited with this request.
   If this control argument is used, neither the current meeting nor
   the list will be changed. 
-count, -ct
   Prints the number of meetings remaining in the changed meeting list.
   This control argument and it is incompatible with both the -all and
   -list control arguments.
-list, -ls
   Prints or returns a list of the remaining meetings in the list of
   changed meetings.  If this control argument is used, neither the
   current meeting nor the list will be changed.


Notes:  The check_meetings request must have already been used in this
process.  This request calls the request processor with the request
line:

    goto MEETING_NAME

so a user-defined abbreviation for the goto request will be expanded.

When -all or -list is used, the count of new transactions displayed is
the number of transactions that were new when the check_meetings
request was invoked.
