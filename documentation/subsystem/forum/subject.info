01/22/82  forum request:  subject, sj

Syntax:  sj {new_subject} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active request:  [sj]


Function:  changes the subject of the unprocessed transaction or 
prints/returns the subject of the unprocessed transaction.


Arguments:
new_subject
   is a string formed by concatenating the non-control arguments.
   It becomes the subject of the unprocessed transaction.


Control arguments:
-default
   changes the subject to the subject of the transaction that the unprocessed
   transaction is in reply to. This control argument may only be used with
   replies and may not be used if new_subject is given.
-subject, -sj
   specifies that the subject begins with the next argument. Useful if the 
   first character ot the subject is '-'.


Notes:
   When given no arguments, the subject request prints or returns the current
subject of the unprocessed transaction, if any.  An unprocessed transaction is
a transaction that has been "built" by the user, either by exiting the talk
request with the \fq request, or by using the qedx or ted requests; but has
not yet been entered into a forum.
