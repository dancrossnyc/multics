7/2/83  forum request:  apply, ap

Syntax:  ap {trans_specs} {-control_args} command_line


Function:
places the text of the specified transaction into a temporary segment,
catenates the pathname of this segment to the end of command_line and
executes the resulting Multics command line.  If the unprocessed
transaction is specified, the transaction text is updated from the
contents of the temporary segment after execution.


Arguments:
trans_specs
   are transaction specifiers. If no trans_specs are given, the
   unprocessed transation is selected. If there is no unprocessed
   transaction, one is created. Type "help trans_specs" for more
   information on transaction specifiers.
command_line
   is the Multics command line to which is catenated the pathname of the
   temporary segment before execution.


Control arguments:
-by_chain
   specifies that transactions are to be grouped by transaction chain.
-fill, -fi
   specifies that the unprocessed transaction is to be refilled upon 
   return from the command. This is the default unless the 
   -no_input_fill control argument was given to the forum command or 
   unless the -no_fill control argument was given to the talk or reply
   request.
-include_deleted, -idl
   lists transactions even if they have been deleted. See "Notes"
   below. Default is -only_non_deleted.
-initial
   only lists transactions which are first in transaction chains.


-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the transaction is not to be refilled upon return
   from the command.
-only_deleted, -odl
   list only deleted transactions. See "Notes" below. Default is
   -only_non_deleted.
-only_non_deleted, -ondl
   list only non-deleted transactions. (Default)
-reverse, -rv
   causes transactions to be listed in the reverse order that they were
   given in the transaction specifier.


List of transaction specification control arguments:
-after DT, -af DT
   selects transactions entered on or after the the date specified.
   The time of day is ignored.
-after_time DT, -aft DT
   selects transactions entered after the date_time specified.
-before DT, -be DT
   selects transactions entered before the date specified. The time
   of day is ignored.
-before_time DT, -bet DT
   selects transactions entered before the date_time specified.
-between DT1 DT2, -bt DT1 DT2
   selects transactions entered between the dates specified,
   inclusive.  The times of day are ignored.


-between_time DT1 DT2, -btt DT1 DT2
   selects transactions entered between the date_times specified,
   inclusive.
-date DT, -dt DT
   selects transactions entered on the day specified.
-from Person_id, -fm Person_id
   selects transactions entered by the participant named Person_id.
-subject /regexp/, -sj /regexp/
   selects transactions whose subjects match the given regular
   expression.
-text /regexp/, -tx /regexp/
   selects transactions whose text matches the given regular
   expression.


Notes: The supplied command line need not be enclosed in quotes.
However, if there are (), [], or "'s in the command line which should
be processed by the Multics command processor, they should be enclosed
in quotes to prevent processing by forum's request processor.

If more than one transaction is selected, the command line is applied
to each selected transaction in turn.  In order to select a deleted
transaction, the user must either be the chairman of the meeting, or
the author of the deleted transaction.


Examples:
This request may be used to edit the unprocessed transaction with an
editor other than qedx or ted.  For example, the request

   !  apply emacs

will invoke the emacs editor on the transaction.

The request

   !  apply aref send_mail Smith -sj Transactions -if

will send each transaction in the current chain as mail to the user
Smith.
