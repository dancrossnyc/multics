12/2/84  forum request:  talk, t

Syntax:  t {-control_args}


Function:
allows a participant to build a new transaction and optionally enter
it into a meeting.


Control arguments:
-auto_write
   do not require the "w" request to be given in the editor
   in order to save editing changes. This is only meaningful
   if the transaction is entered from the terminal and ended
   with \f.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message that says that the transaction was
   successfully entered.


-fill, -fi
   specifies that the transaction should be filled after the user has
   exited input mode. This is the default, unless the -input_file
   control argument is used or unless the -no_input_fill (-nif) control
   argument was given with the invocation of forum.  The default fill
   width is 72, but the user can specify the fill width via the
   -line_length control argument or either the -line_length
   or -input_line_length control arguments to the forum command.
-force, -fc
   overwrites a previous unprocessed transaction without querying.
-input_file pathname, -if pathname
   specifies that the segment identified by pathname be entered into
   the proceedings. The default is to input the transaction from the
   terminal.


-line_length LENGTH, -ll LENGTH
   fills the transaction to the specified line length.  The default is
   72 columns unless a different value was given with the
   -input_line_length or -line_length control arguments to the forum
   command.
-long, -lg
   print a message indicating that the transaction was successfully
   entered. (Default)
-meeting meeting_name, -mtg meeting_name
   enters the transaction into the proceedings of the meeting_name
   meeting.  The default is to enter the transaction into the
   proceedings of the meeting the user is currently attending.
   meeting_name may be a meeting name or a pathname.


-no_auto_write
   Require the "w" request to be given in the editor
   in order to save editing changes. This is only meaningful
   if the transaction is entered from the terminal and ended
   with \f.  (Default)
-no_fill, -nfi
   specifies that the transaction not be filled to the default fill
   width when entered.  The default is to fill the transaction, unless
   the -input_file control argument is specified or the -no_input_fill
   argument was given with the invocation of forum.  The default fill
   width is 72, but the user can specify the fill width via the
   -line_length control argument or either the -line_length
   or -input_line_length control arguments to the forum command.
-no_force, -nfc
   query before overwriting a previous unprocessed transaction.


-no_request_loop, -nrql
   causes the transaction to be entered into the meeting without first
   entering the forum request loop. (Default unless -if is given)
-request_loop, -rql
   causes the forum request loop to be entered before the transaction
   is entered in the meeting. (default if -if is given)
-subject subject_string, -sj subject_string
   Specifies that subject_string be used as the subject, avoiding the
   prompt for subject. The default is to prompt the user for the
   subject. If subject_string contains spaces, it must be quoted.
-terminal_input, -ti
   Specifies that the transaction be input from the user's terminal.
   (Default)


Notes on terminal input:
Unless the user makes use of the -input_file control argument, the
transaction will be built by taking lines from the user's terminal.
There are three methods of exiting from terminal input mode:

   line consisting of the single character period (.)
	Enters the transaction as is, returns to forum request level.

   \f
	Exits terminal input mode and invokes 'qedx' editor on transaction.

   \q or \fq
	Exits terminal input mode and enters forum request loop.


Notes:
A transaction which was not entered via the period (.) exit from
terminal input mode may be entered from forum request level via the
'enter' request.  Type 'help enter' from forum request level for
details.
