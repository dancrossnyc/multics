Notes:
If no pathname is given, the selected transactions are written to a
segment in the working directory with the entryname
meeting_name.trans.  The user's current transaction index will be set
to the last transaction written.

In order to write a deleted transaction, the user must either be the
chairman of the meeting, or the author of the deleted transaction.


Notes on formatting:
Formatted output consists of a page header containing the current date
and time, the name of the meeting, and the page number; and a footer
containing the subject of the first transaction on the page.  The
header and footer are separated from the text by a line of underscores
and a blank line.  Tramsactions are only split across pages if they are
longer than one page.  If a transaction does not fit on the remainder
of the current page, a new page is always created.  The -separator
control argument may not be used when formatting output.
