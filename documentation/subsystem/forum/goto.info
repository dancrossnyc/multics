6/2/83  forum request:  goto, go, g

Syntax:  g {meeting_name} {-control_args}


Function:
The goto request is used to enter a meeting, or to switch from one meeting
to another.  This request requires access to the meeting_name meeting.


Argument:

   '.control' suffix is optional. Either this argument or the "-meeting"
   control argument must be given.


Control argument:
-meeting meeting_name, -mtg meeting_name
   enters the meeting whose pathname or entryname is meeting_name.
   See the description of the meeting_name argument above.
-no_return_on_error, -nroe
   does not return to the current meeting if meeting_name does not exist
   or cannot be opened for any other reason. (Default)
-return_on_error, -roe
   returns to the current meeting if the new meeting cannot be opened.
