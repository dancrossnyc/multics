03/07/87  new_proc

Syntax:  new_proc {process_number} {-control_arg}


Function: causes an existing disconnected process to be replaced by a
new process, and connects your terminal to the new process.


Arguments:
process_number
   is the sequence number of the process which you wish to be
   replaced by a new process.  If you have more than one disconnected
   process, this argument must be supplied. The list request displays
   a list of your disconnected processes, with their sequence numbers.


Control arguments:
-immediate, -im
   bypasses termination of the existing process by the trm_ IPS signal
   (which causes running of finish and epilogue handlers in the
   existing process) and instead tells the hardcore to destroy the
   existing process immediately.
