Syntax:  destroy {process_number} {-control_args}


Function: destroys an existing disconnected process, and returns the
user to request level.


Arguments:
process_number
   is the sequence number of the process which you wish to be
   destroyed. If you have more than one disconnected process, this
   argument must be supplied. The list request displays a list of your
   disconnected processes, with their sequence numbers.


Control arguments:
-hold, -hd
   prevents the breaking of the connection between the terminal and the
   answering service.  (Default)
-immediate, -im
   bypasses termination of the existing process by the trm_ IPS signal
   (which causes running of finish and epilogue handlers in the
   existing process) and instead tells the hardcore to destroy the
   existing process immediately.
-no_hold, -nhd
   drops the connection after the disconnected process is destroyed.
