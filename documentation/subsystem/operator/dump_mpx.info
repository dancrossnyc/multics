02/13/85 dump_mpx

Syntax as a command:  dump_mpx mpx_name


Function:  forces an immediate dump of the specified multiplexer.  This
causes the multiplexer to crash, hanging up any users logged in over
its channels.  Therefore, if there are any such users, the number of
users is printed, and you are asked if the dump should still be taken.
Any reply other than "yes" causes the dump not to be taken, and the
multiplexer to continue running.  All the channels in the CDT that
match the starname a.* are hung up by this command.  This command can
be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
mpx_name
   specifies the name of the multiplexer to be dumped.


Notes:  Individual multiplexers respond to this command in whatever way
is appropriate to their implementation.  For FNPs a message is printed,
giving the pathname of the segment containing the dump of the FNP.
This is not a printable segment; its contents can be examined and
interpreted by a system programmer, using the online_dump_fnp (od_fnp)
or debug_fnp command.

This command should only be used at the direction of the system
programming staff.  The answering service automatically reloads a
multiplexer if it crashes.
