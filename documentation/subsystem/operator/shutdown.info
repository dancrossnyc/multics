02/21/85  shutdown, shut

Syntax as a command:  shut


Function:  is used after all users are logged out to make a normal exit
from Multics.  If any users are still logged in, the system asks if you
really want to shut down.  Usually, you should not.  Answering "yes"
causes the system to shut down.  Answering "no" returns the system to
initializer command level so that the logged in users can be bumped.
This command can be used in ring 1 or ring 4.


Notes:  The shutdown command should be issued only after a stop
command, unless this is the end of a special session in which a startup
or a multics command was never issued.
