02/14/85  multics, mult

Syntax as a command:  mult


Function:  initializes the answering service but does not accept
logins.  It is the first half of a startup.  A random login word is
made up, which the users must use to log in on this special session.
This command can be used in ring 1 or ring 4.


Notes:  Typing the multics command initializes the answering service
and generates a random login word.  To cause the lines to answer, type
go.  To revert to a normal session, use the word command.  Part one of
the system_start_up.ec is executed before the answering service is
initialized.

When this command is issued in ring 1, it causes the entire RLV to be
mounted, if not already accepted (when issued in ring 4, the RLV is
already accepted).
