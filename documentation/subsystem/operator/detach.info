02/13/85 detach

Syntax as a command:  detach target {message}


Function:  prevents the answering service from listening for calls on a
channel.  Any user logged in on the channel is bumped.  This is done by
signalling as with the bump command.  This command can be used in ring
4 only.


Arguments:
target
   must be one of the following.
   Person_id Project_id, Person_id.Project_id
      to detach the user with the specified name and project.  The star
      convention may be used for either or both names.
   channel_id
      detaches the user on the channel whose name is channel_id.  These
      names can be either terminal or network channel names.  See the
      Multics System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81,
      for information on channel names.


   mpx name
      detaches all users whose terminals are connected through the
      multiplexer specified by name.  The name argument must be the
      name of a multiplexer or an FNP.
message
   is the string that is typed on the user's terminal.  If message is
   omitted, the user is not told what is happening.


Notes:  If the message "channel_id detached" is printed, then the
detach has been signalled.  If the user on the channel does not log out
shortly, try the remove command.
