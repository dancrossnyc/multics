Syntax as a command:  stop


Function:  begins the shutdown process.  The stop command also executes
a "word shutdown" command, so that no more users may log in.  The
system automatically executes a "bump * * 3" to bump all users, giving
them a three minute warning.  Users with the nobump privilege are not
bumped.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.
