Syntax as a command:  x vcomp initials


Function:  causes the volume dumper to perform a complete volume dump.
A new Volume_Dumper.Daemon process is logged in to perform the dump;
thus, it can be run concurrently with other volume dumper operations.


Arguments:

Notes:  The tapes to be used for the dump are selected automatically by
the volume dumper.  The oldest available tapes, in a pool reserved for

are available, you are asked for a new tape and it is added to the
pool.
