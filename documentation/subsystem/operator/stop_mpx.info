02/21/85 stop_mpx

Syntax as a command:  stop_mpx name


Function:  causes the specified multiplexer to be made inactive.  This
makes the multiplexer stop listening for further calls on its dialup
channels if it is up and running; it inhibits listening to the channels
after a bootload, if one is in progress; it prevents automatic
reloading of the multiplexer if it crashes (or is crashed by the
dump_mpx command); and if issued before startup, it prevents the
loading of the multiplexer during startup.  Users currently logged in
over the multiplexer channels are not affected.  This command can be
used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
name
   specifies the multiplexer that is to be made inactive.


Notes:  To bump all users logged in over channels of this multiplexer
(see the bump command for more information), type:

   !  stop_mpx name
   !  bump mpx name {mm} {message}

This sequence of the two commands stop_mpx and bump mpx is the
recommended method of taking a multiplexer out of service while Multics
remains up.

Hardwired channels normally appear to be dialed up at all times; such
channels are not affected by the stop_mpx command.


The effect of the stop_mpx command can be reversed by issuing the
start_mpx command, provided that the multiplexer remains running during
the time it is out of service.  If it does not remain running, the
load_mpx command must be used to return it to service.
