02/18/85 preload

Syntax as a command:  preload device_name volume_name -control_arg


Function:  informs the system that a tape volume is to be preloaded on
a specified device for a certain user.  This allows you to load tapes
in advance when the needs of a user are known.  This command can be
used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
device_name
   is the name of the device on which the volume is to be preloaded.
volume_name
   is the name of the volume to be preloaded.


Control arguments:
-user STR
   where STR is the name of the user for whom this preload is being
   performed.  This is a string of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.


Notes:  This command only informs the system of your intention to
preload a particular volume on a specified device for a user.  It does
not check the loading of the proper volume on the device.  This label
checking is done at attach time.

Use of the preload command does not preserve the preloaded device.  The
preloaded volume may be automatically unloaded if another user of the
system requests a mount of a different volume on the preloaded device.

The user name specified may contain fields that match any string.
These are specified by the use of an asterisk (*) in the appropriate
field.  For example, the user name "*.Proj.*" will match any user on
the project Proj.  Also, missing trailing fields are assumed to be *.
For example, "*.Proj" also matches any user in the Proj project.
