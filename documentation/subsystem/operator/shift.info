02/18/85 shift

Syntax as a command:  shift
or
shift {shift_number} {time}
or
shift auto


Function:  sets and prints the shift and the time of the next scheduled
shift change.  It should be used at the direction of the system
administrator, to override the values in the shift table.  This command
can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
shift_number
   is the number of the shift to change to.  The shift_number argument
   must be a number in the range 0-7, and must also be one of the
   shifts normally used at the site, for which billing rates are
   defined in installation_parms.
time
   is the time of the next shift change.  It is a clock reading,
   acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  If time
   contains spaces it must be enclosed in quotes.  The time argument
   may be no more than one week in the future.
auto
   is a literal string that causes the system to use the value of the
   shift and the shift change time specified in the shift table.


Notes:  When the system is started up, a shift command from a previous
bootload remains in effect until the specified time.

To change the shift without changing the time, type

   !  shift shift_number

To change the shift and the shift change time to the regularly
scheduled values (specified in the shift table), type:

   !  shift auto


To cause the shift and the next shift change time to be displayed,
type:

   !  shift

The message

      shift  shift_number  until  time

is printed in response to all three forms of the shift command.  If the
shift or the time have been changed, their new values are displayed.


The best time to execute the shift command is shortly (about one
minute) before a regularly scheduled shift change.  If the shift
command must be executed in the middle of a shift, then notice should
be given by executing it at the beginning of that shift, using the
regular shift number and the time of the anticipated unscheduled shift
change.
