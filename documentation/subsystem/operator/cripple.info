02/13/85 cripple

Syntax as a command:  cripple


Function:  prepares for a hierarchy reload operation that reloads the
system library directories or the initializer's directory
>system_control_1.

To do such a hierarchy reload, bring up a special session and log in a
daemon process to be used for reloading (e.g., Dumper.SysDaemon).  The
message coordinator should not be used during such a reload, since its
programs and data bases are likely to be replaced by the reload, too.
(See the no_start command.)  This command can be used only in ring 4.


Notes:  After the reloader is logged in, the cripple command is typed
to shut off the answering service so that no unexpected faults will
occur if one of the answering service data bases or programs is deleted
by the reloader.

When the reload is done, do not attempt to shut down, as this is likely
to cause a fault.  Instead, reenter BCE with the bce command or from
the processor panel.  (A reset command resets the effect of cripple,
but is not recommended.)
