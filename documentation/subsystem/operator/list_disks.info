08/27/86  list_disks, ld

Syntax as a command:  ld {drive_name} {-control_args}


Function: lists the usage of storage system disk drives and all pending
add_lv commands.  You can use it in ring 1 or 4.


Arguments:
drive_name
   is the name of a drive to be listed.  If you give no drive_name, all
   drives configured on the system are listed.


Control arguments:
-lv lvname
   list only drives pertaining to lvname.
-pv pvname
   list only drives pertaining to pvname.
-brief, -bf
   list only nonempty drives.
-mounts, -mt
   list only pending ad_lv commands.


Notes: If a physical volume is listed with the logical volume name in
parentheses and one star at the end of the line, that volume is assumed
to be present, as a result of a previous bootload, demount, or
outstanding add_lv.  The system has not read the volume label, but does
so in response to an add_vol command.

If a physical volume is listed with the logical volume name in
parentheses and three stars at the end of the line, that volume is
known; its label has been read by an add_vol command.  You must issue
an add_lv command to place the volume in use.
