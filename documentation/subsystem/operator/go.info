Syntax as a command:  go


Function:  initializes all channels attached to the answering service
so that they answer the phone.  It is the second half of startup.
Typing multics and then go is similar to startup except that the login
word is set to a random number, so only users who know the special word
can log in.  The go command initializes all lines in the channel
definition table (CDT).  Parts two and three of the system_start_up.ec
are executed in response to a go command.  Part two (the logging in of
the daemons) is done before user lines are conditioned for answering;
part three (commands executed after the phone lines are conditioned for
answering) is done afterward.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Notes:  A check is made to see if a down command has previously been
issued.  If one is found, and more than 30 minutes remain before it
takes effect, the down command is reissued automatically.
