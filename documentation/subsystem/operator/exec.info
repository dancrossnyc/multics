Syntax as a command:  x exec_command {arguments}


Function:  executes operator commands implemented in the segment
>sc1>admin.ec.  The version of admin.ec distributed with the system
implements a number of commands that have been found to be generally
useful.  These are listed below and described fully in Section 5.

A site may wish to modify these commands, or to implement new operator
commands, to meet the needs of the site.  This can be done by making
changes or additions to >sc1>admin.ec.  It is recommended that these
changes and additions be documented by the site, by adding or replacing
pages in Section 5 in the copies of this manual that are used by
operations personnel.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


The effect of the exec command is as if the command had been typed in
admin mode.
