08/22/86  down

Syntax as a command:  down {time} {back} {reason}


Function: schedules an automatic shutdown for a specified time and an
automatic bump of users for N minutes before the time of the shutdown.
At the time of the bump, all interactive users are warned that they
will be logged out in N minutes.  You can use it only in ring 4.


Arguments:
time
   is the time to schedule an automatic shutdown.  It is a clock
   reading acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_.  Enclose in quotes if
   it contains spaces.  If you omit it, the command displays the
   current down settings.
back
   is the time announced to users when the system will come back up.
   Give it in the same form as the time argument.
reason
   is a message that tells users the reason for the shutdown.


Notes: N is figured using the value of warning_time, a parameter in
the installation_parms segment.  The warning_time parameter in the
installation_parms segment is the number of real-time seconds between
warning of an automatic logout and the actual logout.  N equals
warning_time divided by 60, rounded up to the next whole minute; for
example, if the installation_parms segment shows a warning_time value
of 6000 seconds, then N will be 100 minutes.

When the system is started up, a check is made to see if a down command
has been issued that has not yet taken effect.  If one is found and
more than 30 minutes remain before it takes effect, the down command is
reissued automatically.


If absentee is up when you issue this command, an automatic absentee
stop is set up for 20 minutes before shutdown.  If absentee is not up
when you issue this command, but it is brought up later, the automatic
absentee stop is still set up for 20 minutes before shutdown.  If
absentee is already being shut down when you issue this command, the
shutdown of absentee continues.
