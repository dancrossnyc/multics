02/12/85  add_lv, alv

Syntax as a command:  alv lv_name {-control_arg}


Function:  causes a logical volume to be accepted for paging.  This
command can be used in ring 1 or ring 4.


Arguments:
lv_name
   is the name of a registered logical volume.


Control arguments:
-all
   to mount all incomplete logical volumes.


Notes:  If all physical volumes for the logical volume are already
accepted, known, or assumed, the add_lv command ensures that all labels
have been read and checked, and then accepts the logical volume for
paging.

If one or more volumes are missing, the add_lv command assigns drives
for the missing volumes, prints mount messages for each missing volume
in the form shown below.

      mount pv k202 on dska_07


and sets the assigned drives into the assumed state.  You may mount the
physical volumes where requested or use your own judgment.  As each
physical volume is mounted, issue an add_vol command to the system; the
last add_vol command causes the logical volume to be accepted with a
message of the form shown below.

      lv cp22 mounted
      private lv cp22 mounted

When the add_lv command is issued, all assumed drives should have the
correct packs mounted; otherwise an error message is typed.

The list_disks command lists all outstanding add_lv commands and the
del_lv command cancels an outstanding add_lv.


User processes may initiate add_lv commands for private logical volumes
by use of the attach_lv command.  The system proceeds as though an
add_lv command had been issued by the operator.

Unless the nodt and/or nolv keyword is included with the BCE boot
command, the system attempts to mount all logical volumes during
initialization that were mounted at the last shutdown.  For each
physical volume required, the system attempts to use the drive on which
the volume was mounted at the last shutdown.
