03/15/85 copy_dump

Syntax as a command:  copy_dump


Function:  copy a dump image taken by BCE out of the DUMP partition
into the Multics hierarchy.  It creates as many segments (up to ten) in
>dumps as necessary to hold the dump image.


Notes:  The name of each segment has the form:

      mmddyy.tttt.s.eee

where:
mmddyy
   is the date the dump was taken.
tttt
   is the time the dump was taken.
s
   is a sequence number (0, 1, 2, ...  9).
nnnn
   is the dump number assigned when recording this dump.


:Entries:  set_fdump_num:  03/15/85 copy_dump$set_fdump_num,
copy_dump$sfdn


Function:  This entry point sets the value of the next dump to be taken
by changing the value associated with the dump number in the DUMP
partition.


Syntax:  copy_dump$sfdn dmpno


Arguments:
dmpno
   is the dump number for the next dump to be taken.


Access required:  This command interfaces to hphcs_$copy_fdump and to
hphcs_$set_fdump_num and requires access to hphcs_.


Notes:  The DUMP parition is modified only after the last dump taken
has been copied.  If an attempt is made to change the dump number
before a dump has been copied, an error message is returned.

This command does not allow a particular dump to be copied twice;
therefore, it will return an error code if an attempt is made to recopy
a dump.
