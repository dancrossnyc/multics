Syntax as a command:  admin


Function:  causes the system to enter admin mode, allowing you to use
the bootload console or an initializer terminal to execute normal
Multics commands.  (The only restriction is that you can't be in admin
mode on more than one terminal at a time.)  Because the initializer has
extraordinary power and special limitations, admin mode should only be
used by or at the request of a system programmer or system
administrator.  To enforce this, a password is required in order to
enter admin mode.  This command can be used only in ring 4.
