02/21/85  terminate, term

Syntax as a command:  term target {message}


Function:  causes the initializer to destroy a user's process and
create a new one.  It has the effect of a new_proc command given in the
user's process.  If the user's process is not currently connected to a
terminal, it is logged out.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
target
   must be one of the following:
   Person_id.Project_id, Person_id Project_id
      terminates the user with the specified name and project.  The
      star convention may be used for either or both names.
   channel_id
      terminates the user on the channel whose name is channel_id.
      These names can be either terminal channel names or network
      channel names.  (See the Multics System Maintenance Procedures
      manual, Order No.  AM81, for information on channel names.)


   mpx name
      terminates all users whose terminals are connected through the
      multiplexer specified by name.  The name argument must be the
      name of a multiplexer or an FNP.
message
   is the message string that is printed on the user's terminal.


Notes:  The terminate command is only to be used if the user requests
that his process be terminated.  This command can be used to bump a
user whose process is not currently connected to a terminal, even if
the user's process has the "nobump" attribute.
