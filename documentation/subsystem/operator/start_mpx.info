02/21/85 start_mpx

Syntax as a command:  start_mpx name


Function:  causes a multiplexer that is already initialized (loaded) to
be made active, and all channels configured on it to be listened to.
This command can be used after a load_mpx command that was issued with
the -no_start argument, or after a stop_mpx command, to reverse the
effect of the latter command.  For a multiplexer that is not
initialized, the load_mpx command must be issued before the start_mpx
command.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
name
   designates the multiplexer that is to be activated.  All the
   channels in the CDT that match the starname name.** will be listened
   to.
