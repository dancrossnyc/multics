Syntax as a command:  bump target {mm} {message}


Function:  logs out a user at a specified time.  It does this by
causing the initializer to signal itself to bump the user.  If the
initializer is operating improperly and cannot handle logins, bump
probably will not operate properly either.  This command can be used
only in ring 4.


Arguments:
target
   must be one of the following listed below.
   Person_id Project_id, Person_id.Project_id
      bumps the user with the specified name and project.  The star
      convention may be used for either or both names.  Users with the
      nobump privilege are sent a message informing them that an
      attempt to bump them has been made.
   channel_id
      bumps the user on the channel whose name is channel_id.  These
      names can be either terminal or network channel names.  This
      argument overrides the nobump attribute.  See the Multics System
      Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for information
      on channel names.


   mpx NAME
      bumps all users whose terminals are connected through the
      multiplexer specified by NAME.  The NAME argument must be the
      name of a multiplexer or an FNP.
mm
   is the number of minutes to elapse, after which the user is bumped.
   If MM is omitted, the user is bumped immediately.
message
   is a string that is typed on the user's terminal.  If message is
   omitted, the user is not told why he is being bumped.


Notes:  Sometimes, the bump command appears to work -- the message
"Person_id.Project_id bumped" is printed -- but the user is not logged
out.  If this happens, try the remove command on the user's terminal
channel.

See the abs bump and abs cancel commands for instructions on bumping
absentee users.  See the logout command for instructions on logging out
daemon processes.
