02/13/85 disconnect

Syntax as a command:  disconnect target


Function:  hangs up a login-service communications channel.  This
typically results in the user process entering the disconnected state,
which allows the user to log in again and reconnect to the process.  If
the user is not allowed to have disconnected processes or has disabled
disconnection service for the process, it is logged out.  The command
can be used when part of the communications network has broken down
without informing Multics.  For example, if a foreign terminal
concentrator crashes, it is possible for Multics to still treat the
communication lines as dialed-up.

The disconnect command causes the initializer to send a signal to
itself to hang up the specified channel.  If the initializer or Multics
communications software is malfunctioning, disconnect will probably not
operate properly either.  This command can be used in ring 4 only.
