02/18/85 remove

Syntax as a command:  remove channel_id1 {channel_id2 ...  channel_idN}


Function:  controls communications channels for login, slave, autocall,
or ftp service.  Specifically, it directs the answering service to stop
using specified channels or making them available.  Any user logged in
on one of these channels is logged out immediately with no message.
This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
channel_idi
   are the names of the channels to be removed.  (See the Multics
   System Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for
   information on channel names.)  The channel_id arguments may be
   either terminal channel names or network channel names.


Notes:  The remove command sometimes succeeds where bump and detach
fail, because it uses different mechanisms for destroying the user's
process.  This command should not be used unless the user complains of
channel trouble and cannot be bumped.  Once a channel is removed, the
telephone associated with the channel will not answer and the channel
cannot be used for logins again until an attach command reattaches it
to the answering service.
