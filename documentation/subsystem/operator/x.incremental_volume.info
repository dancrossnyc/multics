03/15/85  incremental_volume, vinc

Syntax as a command:  x vinc initials


Function:  causes the volume dumper to perform an incremental volume
dump and then set a timer that causes incremental volume dumps to be
performed every 60 minutes.  See the note under the complete_volume
command describing the volume dumper tape pool.


Arguments:
initials
   are the user's name or initials.


Notes:  The command "r vinc end_volume_dump" must be given to terminate
an incremental volume dump properly, before the dumper process is
logged out.  Failure to do this causes unpredictable errors to occur
when the dumper process is logged out.
