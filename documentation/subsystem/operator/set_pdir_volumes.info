02/18/85 set_pdir_volumes

Syntax as a command:  set_pdir_volumes lv_name1 ...  lv_nameN


Function:  is used in the initializer process to define the set of
logical volumes available for process directory segments.  This command
can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
lv_namei
   is the name of one or more mounted, public logical volumes to be
   used for process directory segments.


Notes:  Process directories are assigned to logical volumes in
proportion to the number of physical volumes in each logical volume.
Volumes specified by this command must have adequate space available to
hold that proportion of process directory segments.

The existing set of process directory volumes, if any, is replaced by
this command.  Only mounted, public logical volumes can be made
available for process directory segments.  If none of the specified
volumes is suitable, the existing set of process directory volumes is
not replaced.  See the add_pdir_volume and del_pdir_volume commands to
add to or delete from the set of process directory volumes.
