02/18/85 reroute

Syntax as a command:  reroute source stream old_vcons new_vcons


Function:  reroutes output from a source to a new virtual console.  Do
not confuse this command with the redefine and substty commands.  This
command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
source
   is the name of the source of output.
stream
   is the name of the stream on which output is being carried.
old_vcons
   is the name of the virtual console that was receiving output.
new_vcons
   is the name of the virtual console to which output is now to be
   routed.


Notes:  This command changes the routing table so that the output from
"source" on stream "stream" is sent to the virtual console "new_vcons"
instead of "old_vcons."  The reroute command is equivalent to typing
the sequence:

      deroute source stream old_vcons

      route source stream new_vcons

This command can not be used to reroute RCP messages and other syserr
traffic from the bootload console to an initializer terminal.
