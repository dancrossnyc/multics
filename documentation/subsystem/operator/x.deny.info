Syntax as a command:  x deny device


Function:  forcibly unassigns an I/O device from a user process.  It
should be used when the device is not operating properly or when it is
not possible to mount the requested volume on the device.  This causes
the process to be signaled, allowing the program using the device to
take some appropriate action rather then waiting indefinitely for the
device to respond.


Arguments:
device
   is the name of the device to be unassigned.
