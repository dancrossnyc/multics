Syntax as a command:  x cat initials tape {date time}


Function:  causes the hierarchy dumper to perform a catchup dump.  If
the incremental hierarchy dumper is running, it must be ended (r bk
end_dump) before the catchup dump can begin.  When the catchup dump is
completed, the incremental dump cycle is automatically started.  The
hierarchy subtrees dumped are the same ones that are dumped by the
incremental dumper; the same dump control file is used for both.


Arguments:
initials
   are the user's name or initials (up to 16 characters).
tape
   is the name of the first tape to be used.
date time
   is the optional date and time from which the catchup dump is to be
   made.  The default is to dump all objects modified since midnight of
   the day preceding the current day (i.e., between 24 and 48 hours
   ago).
