Syntax as a command:  who {-control_args} {User_ids}


Function:  lists the users who are logged in, along with information.
This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Control arguments:
-absentee, -as
   prints the ratio of absentee users logged in to the number of
   absentee slots currently available, and then lists the absentee
   users.
-channel chn_id, -chn chn_id
   lists only interactive users whose channel name matches chn_id, or
   daemon users whose source name (e.g., prta, vinc, etc) matches
   chn_id, or absentee users whose absentee name (e.g., abs1) matches
   chn_id.  The chn_id argument may be a starname to cause several
   users to be listed.
-daemon, -dmn
   prints the number of currently active daemon processes and then
   lists them.


-group {name}, -gp {name}
   prints a list of users that fall under the specified load control
   group (see "Notes" below).
-interactive, -ia
   prints a list of all users having current interactive processes.
-name, -nm
   sorts the users by name.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses column headings and load control heading from the printed
   output.


-pdir_volume {lv_name}, -pdv {lv_name}
   either includes in the output the name of the logical volume
   containing the user's process directory segments (if no lv_name
   argument is given) or prints information about only the users whose
   process directory segments are on the volume specified by the
   lv_name argument.
-project, -pj
   sorts the users by project.
-secondary, -sc
   prints a list of all users having currently active secondary user
   processes.
User_ids
   are access control names in one of the following forms:


   Person_id.Project_id
      lists all users logged in with the specified Person_id and
      Project_id.
   Person_id
      lists all users logged in with the specified Person_id.

   .Project_id
      lists all users logged in with the specified Project_id.


Notes:  The who command produces a list of all users, showing
Person_id, time of login, terminal ID, weight, channel_id, load control
group, and flags.  Anonymous users are flagged with a "*" before the
user name.

Users who are not listed by a regular who command issued by normal
users are flagged with an "N".  Users with the nobump privilege are
flagged with "+".  (These users can be bumped only by specifying that
their terminal channel is to be dumped.)  Users who may be bumped by
others in their project but whose "grace" has not run out are flagged
with ">".  Users who have been bumped but still have some of their
warning time left before automatic logout are flagged with "X".
Disconnected or suspended processes (interactive or absentee) are
indicated by "DS".  "S" alone indicates that the user has secondary
status.  The absence of a flag indicates a user with primary status.



Absentee users are listed after interactive users.  Each absentee is
flagged with "A", the user_id is followed by the name of the absin file
in parentheses, and the queue and slot number are indicated instead of
terminal and channel names.  Daemon users are listed last.  Each daemon
is flagged with "D" and its source identifier shown.
