02/18/85  reconfigure, rcf

Syntax as a command:  rcf function type name {-control_args}


Function:  manipulates selected reconfigurable entities in the current
confinguration.  This command can be used only in ring 4.


Arguments:
function
   specifies the function to be performed.  Can be one of the following
   values:
   add
      adds selected reconfigurable entities to the current
      configuration, making them available for use.
   delete
      deletes selected reconfigurable entities from the current
      configuration, making them unavailable for use.


type
   is one of the reconfigurable entities listed below under "List of
   Reconfigurable Entities."
name
   is the name of the item being reconfigured.  Examples of names are
   given under "List of Reconfigurable Entities."


Control arguments:
-add_all_attachments
   causes all reconfigurable entities which are newly accessible to be
   added.  This control argument can be used with the add function
   only.
-brief, -bf
   does not print out a list of every item which is manipulated.  This
   is the default.
-delete_all_attachments
   causes all reconfigurable entities which will become inaccessible to
   be deleted.  This control argument can be used with the delete
   function only.
-long, -lg
   prints out a list of every item which is manipulated.


List of reconfigurable entities:
channel, chan, chnl
   a logical channel.  A channel's name is the name by which IOI knows
   it (e.g., a9, b23).
cpu
   A Central Processing Unit.  A processor's name is its tag as it
   appears on a cpu card in the config deck (e.g., a, b).
device, dv prph
   a peripheral device.  A device's name is the name by which RCP knows
   it (e.g., tapa_03, dskb_13, fnpc opca).
iom
   an Input/Ouput Multiplexer.  An IOM's name is its tag as it appears
   on an iom card in the config deck (e.g., a.b).


link_adapter, la
   a link adapter or physical channel.  This is a shorthand way of
   specifying a collection of logical channels.  A link adapter's name
   is the name of its lowest channel (e.g., b28).
mpc
   a Microprogrammed Peripheral Controller.  This is a shorthand way of
   specifying a collection of link adapters (and thus, a collection of
   logical channels).  An MPC's name is its name as it appears on an
   mpc card in the config deck (e.g., mspa, mtpb).


page
   a page of memory.  A page's name is its number.  Pages are numbered
   starting at 0.  Numbers may be given in any form acceptable to the
   cv_interger_string_ function.  A range of pages may be specified
   with an expression of the form <low>:<high>.  Pages to be removed
   must reside within a single system controller.  When you delete all
   of an SCU's pages, the SCU itself is not deleted.
scu, mem
   a System Control Unit.  An SCU's name is its tag as it appears on a
   mem card in the config deck (e.g., a, b).  When you delete all of an
   SCU's pages, the SCU itself is not deleted.
