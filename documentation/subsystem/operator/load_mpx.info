02/13/85 load_mpx

Syntax as a command:  load_mpx name {-control_args}


Function:  forces an immediate reload of the specified multiplexer.
Reloading a running multiplexer hangs up any users logged in over its
channels.  Therefore, if there are any such users, and the -force
control argument is not given, their number is printed, and the reload
is refused.  The multiplexer should be stopped, and the users bumped,
before the reload takes place.  (See the stop_mpx and bump commands.)
The -force control argument can be used to override this restriction.
This command can be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
name
   designates the multiplexer that is to be loaded.


Control arguments:
-no_start, -ns
   does not listen for calls on the channels of this multiplexer when
   the load completes.  The default is to listen to the channels.  (See
   the start_mpx command.)
-check, -ck
   check consistency between channels listed in the CDT and channels
   actually configured on the multiplexer, reporting inconsistencies.
   This control argument should be used after any change in channel
   configuration.  Not all multiplexers may implement this control
   argument.  For FNPs, inconsistencies are reported on the FNP
   console.
-force
   reloads the multiplexer even if some of its channels are in use,
   bumping users logged in on the channel.


Notes:  This command should only be used under direction of the system
programming staff.  The answering service loads multiplexers
automatically under normal circumstances.

If channels of the multiplexer have been added or deleted since the
last time the multiplexer was loaded, these additions and deletions
take effect with the next load_mpx command.
