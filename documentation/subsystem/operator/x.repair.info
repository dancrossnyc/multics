03/15/85 repair

Syntax as a command:  x repair key dir nprocs {salvager_arguments}


Function:  starts (or stops) a multiprocess hierarchy repair.  The
repair can consist of an online directory salvage, a quota_used
correction, or both.  The repair may be performed over the entire
hierarchy or any subtree.  Up to 36 Salvager.SysDaemon processes may
participate in the repair, so that it is completed as rapidly as
possible.  This command should only be used at the direction of the
system administrator or the system programmers.


Arguments:
key
   can be one of the following:
   salv
      performs a directory salvage
   quota
      performs a quota_used correction
   salvquota
      performs both
   stop
      stops a repair that is in progress


dir
   is the directory at the top of the subtree to be repaired.
nprocs
   is the number of processes to be used (1 to 36).
salvager_arguments
   are arguments acceptable to the salvage_dir command.  The default is
   the single argument, -compact.


Notes:  Any of these operations automatically collates and sorts all
output, and dprints the result to "SALV-OUTPUT" and "SALV-ONLINE",
being salvager output and online error messages and quota_corrections,
respectively.  The outputs are kept in the directory
>udd>SysDaemon>Salvager, and automatically deleted when they become two
weeks old.
