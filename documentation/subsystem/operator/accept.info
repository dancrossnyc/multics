Syntax as a command:  accept channel_id {restrict} {target} {bclist}


Function:  accepts a terminal device channel and connects it to the
message coordinator's device complement.  This command cannot be used
on multiplexer channels.  This command can be used only in ring 4.


Arguments:
channel_id
   is the name of a communications channel that must be listed with
   "service:  mc;" in the CMF, or be dialed up by a user who has issued
   the dial system or slave commands.  (See the Multics System
   Maintenance Procedures manual, Order No.  AM81, for information on
   channel names.)
restrict
   may be any of the following.
   full
      the device is able to issue all initializer commands.  This is
      the default.
   none
      no commands allowed.


   reply
      only reply is allowed.
   query
      only who and hmu are allowed.
   daemon
      only reply, intercom, and exec allowed.
target
   if specified, is a source name that is the only source name
   permitted for reply commands issued from channel_id.  This parameter
   is used for terminals dedicated to the control of a single I/O
   daemon.  The default name is *.


bclist
   if specified, it is a "broadcast list."  This list gives the
   channels that will have copies of input from channel_id, in the
   form shown below.

         (input on channel_id) r cd1 hello

   bclist may be

         none                for no broadcasting
         all                 to broadcast to all others
         a.l111,a.h102       to broadcast to the given list

   Output is never broadcast back to the inputting channel.
