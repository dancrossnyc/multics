08/28/86  set_drive_usage, sdu

Syntax as a command:  sdu drive_name usage_type


Function: converts a disk drive from storage system use to user
input/output use or vice versa while the system is running.  You can
use it in ring 1 or 4.


Arguments:
drive_name
   is the name of the drive whose use is to be changed.  It has the
   form <subsys>_<nn>, e.g., dska_05.
usage_type
   can be one of the following:
   io
      converts the specified drive to user input/output use.  This
      drive must be a storage system drive.  The drive cannot have a
      known or accepted physical volume on it; if one is present, use
      the del_lv and del_vol commands to remove it before issuing this
      request.  Once converted, this drive remains a user input/output
      drive until you issue sdu again.


   storage_system, ss
      converts the specified drive to storage system use.  This drive
      must be a user input/output drive.  The drive cannot be assigned
      to any process; you can use the rcp command to find out.  You can
      use the "x deny" command to forcibly remove the drive from any
      user process to which it may be attached.  Once converted, this
      drive remains a storage system drive until you issue sdu again.


Notes: Drives in use by the storage system appear as "storage system"
to rcp, which means that they are unavailable for users.  Drives
assigned to user input/output use appear as "(io drive)" to the
list_disks command.
