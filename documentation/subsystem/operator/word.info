Syntax as a command:  word {login_word} {message}


Function: changes the login word, or the dialup buffer typed out when
a user dials up, or both.  You can use it only in ring 4.


Arguments:
login_word
   is a new login word that is set.  If you set the login word to
   shutdown, no users are allowed to log in; if a user dials up, he is
   told that the system is shutting down and his terminal is hung up
   immediately.  If you give no login_word, the current one is
   displayed along with the message if you gave one.
message
   is a message string to which the dialup buffer is set.  If you give
   it, and if login_word is "login," the message buffer is reset; if
   login_word is "shutdown," the message buffer is set to "Multics is
   shutting down"; if login_word is anything else, the message buffer
   is set to "Special session in progress."
