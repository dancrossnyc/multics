02/21/85  warn, w

Syntax as a command:  w User_id message


Function:  is used to output a message onto a user's terminal,
interrupting whatever other output is being printed.  This command can
be used in ring 4 only.


Arguments:
User_id
   specifies the user to whom the message should be sent.  It may be
   given in either of these forms:

         Person_id.Project_id
         Person_id Project_id

   The star convention is allowed.
message
   is a string that contains the text of the message to be sent to the
   user.


Notes:  If a user to be warned has specified the -no_warning (-nw)
argument at login, no warning message is sent to him, and you are told
that the user could not be warned.

The warn command should not be used for casual communication since the
message is forced into the middle of anything the user is typing,
ruining output.  Use the command only when the system is coming down
shortly, or is likely to crash, or when you have an urgent message for
a particular user who cannot be reached by telephone.
