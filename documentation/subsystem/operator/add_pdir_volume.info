02/12/85 add_pdir_volume

Syntax as a command:  add_pdir_volume lv_name


Function:  is used in the initializer process to add a logical volume
to the set of volumes available for process directory segments.  This
command can be used only in ring 4.


Arguments:
lv_name
   is the name of the mounted public logical volume.


Notes:  Process directory segments are temporary segments associated
with each interactive, absentee, and daemon process.  For system
efficiency, it is desirable that as many volumes as possible be
available for process directory segments.  However, a volume cannot be
dismounted while it is a pdir_volume, or while process directory
segments reside on it.

See also the del_pdir_volume, set_pdir_volumes, and vacate_pdir_volume
commands.
