12/01/86  declare, dcl

Syntax:  dcl fn_name fn_type


Function:  allows the user to declare a nonstandard function which may
be invoked in a subsequent query.  A nonstandard function is any
function not included in built-in functions listed in Section 2, and
may be user-written or may be provided by the local installation.  Two
types of functions may be declared:  set functions which operate on
multiple sets of values and scalar functions which operate on one
occurrence of a set of values.


Arguments:
fn_name
   is the name of the function being declared.  The fn_name must be the
   name of an object segment that can be found using the search rules
   currently in effect.
fn_type
   is the type of the function being declared.  Two types are
   permitted, set or scalar.  A set-type-function operates on multiple
   sets of selected values, whereas a scalar-type-function operates on
   one set of specified values.


Notes:  Scalar functions can accept column values as input from one
table only, provided no row designators are used.  If row designators
are specified, column names must all be qualified with the same row
designator.


Several built-in functions are provided as a standard part of linus.
It is not necessary to declare built-in functions.  If a declare
function has the same name as a built-in function, the declared
function, rather than the built-in function, is invoked when the
function name is referenced.
