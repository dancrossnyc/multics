pathname
   is the name of the file where the data will be written to.


Control arguments:

-column_delimiter X, -cdm X

   the column values.  If this control argument isn't specified the
   default column delimiter is a blank.

-extend
   specifies that if the file already exists it should be extended
   rather than truncated.

   specifies that progress messages should not be printed. (DEFAULT)


-progress {N}, -pg {N}
   specifies that a progress message should be printed after N tuples
   have been processed, where N is any positive integer. If N is not
   specified the default is to print a progress message after 1000
   tuples.

-row_delimiter X, -rdm X
   where X is a single ascii character which will be used to delimit
   the row values.  If this control argument isn't specified the
   default row delimiter is the newline character.
