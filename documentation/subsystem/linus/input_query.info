Syntax:  input_query {-control_args}


Function:  Takes the supplied query and makes it available for LINUS
data manipulation requests.


Control Arguments:

-brief, -bf
   specifies that the prompt "Query:" should be suppressed when the
   query is entered from the terminal.

-force, -fc
   specifies that the existing query should be replaced.  If a query
   exists and this control argument isn't used the user is asked if the
   existing query should be replaced.  A negative response terminates
   the invocation of input_query.


-input_file path, -if path
   specifies that the query should be taken from the file named by
   "path".  If path does not have a suffix of ".lquery", one is
   assumed.

-long, -lg
   specifies that the prompt "Query:" should be written when the query
   is input from the terminal (DEFAULT).


-no_force, -nfc
   specifies that if a query exists the user should be asked if it
   should be replaced (DEFAULT).  A negative response terminates the
   invocation of input_query.

-terminal_input, -ti
   specifies that the query should be read from the terminal (DEFAULT).
   A line consisting of only the single character "."  terminates the
   input.  Typing "\q" anywhere on a line also terminates the input.
   Typing "\f" anywhere on a line terminates the input and enters the
   user directly into the qedx editor with the query.


Examples:

input_query -input_file query_file -force
input_query Query:  select * from sales .
