12/01/86  exec_com, ec

Syntax:  ec ec_path {ec_args}


Syntax as an active request:  [ec ec_path {ec_args}]


Function:  executes a program written in the exec_com language which is
used to pass request lines to LINUS and to pass input lines to requests
which read input.  As an active request, the exec_com program specifies
a return value of the exec_com request by use of the &return statement.


Arguments:
ec_paths
   is the pathname of an exec_com program.  The suffix, "lec", is
   assumed if not specified.
ec_args
   are optional arguments to the exec_com program and are substituted
   for parameter references in the program such as &1.


Notes:  For a description of the exec_com language (both version 1 and
version 2), type:
   ..  help v1ec v2ec


When evaluating a LINUS exec_com program, subsystem active requests are
used rather than Multics active functions when evaluating the &[...]
construct and the active string in an &if statement.  The execute
active request may be used to evaluate Multics active strings within
the exec_com.
