02/21/82  LINUS Introduction

     Congratulations!   You  are  now  within  the  Logical Inquiry and
Update  System  (LINUS)  which is a powerful, yet easy to use, facility
for  accessing a Multics Relational Data Store (MRDS) data base.  LINUS
provides  a  complete  data  base  management capability including both
retrieval and update operations.

     By  default,  LINUS will prompt you whenever it expects input from
you.   If  you  are  at LINUS request level, the default prompt will be
"linus:".   If  you  are  at  LILA request level, the prompt will be an
arrow  (->).  Type "help set_mode" if you want to learn how to turn off
the prompting mode.

     There are many requests which you can make within LINUS.  Type "?"
for  a summary list of those requests.  Type "list_requests" for a list
of  those requests that will contain a brief explanation of each.  Type
"help  REQUEST_NAME" in order to obtain more detailed information about
a given request.


Builtin functions:

     Information on the LINUS builtin functions may be obtained by
typing "help builtin_functions"


Helpful hints:

     Knowledge  of  the  following  requests  will allow you to perform
simple retrievals from a data base:

     open, set_scope, lila, print, del_scope, close, quit.

     If  you type a dot (.), LINUS will let you know whether you are at
LINUS request level or within the LILA editor.

     It  is  possible to execute any Multics command line when at LINUS
request  level  by typing "execute command_line" or "e command_line" or
"..command_line".  The latter form is handled slightly differently than
the  first  two.   Type  "help  execute"  for  a  discussion  of  those
differences.
