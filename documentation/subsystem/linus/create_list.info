12/01/86  create_list, cls

Syntax:  cls path {-control_args}


Function:  specifies that selected data is to be retrieved and written
to a specified Lister file.  This file can be manipulated via Lister
commands to create a formatted report.  A translated or translatable
query must be available.


Arguments:
path
   pathname of a Multics file into which the selected data is to be
   written.  The data is written in a form suitable for processing by
   Lister.  The suffix lister is appended to the pathname (if not
   present in the invocation) and the file is created if it does not
   exist.  If the file currently exists, it is truncated unless the
   -extend control argument is specified.


Control arguments:
-extend
   specifies that if the Lister file already exists, it is to be added
   to rather than truncated.  The field names (either default or
   explicitly specified) must be identical to those defined in the
   existing file.
-field_names STR, -fn STR
   explicitly specifies the field names in the Lister file being
   created or extended.  STR is a list of field names that must
   correspond in order and quantity to the items specified in the
   select clause of the associated query.  This control argument must
   be specified if the query select clause contains an expression.  If
   not specified, the names of the selected data base columns become
   the lister file field names.


Notes:  The values being written to the lister file have all leading
and trailing blanks stripped off.
