Syntax:  pr {-control_args}


Function:  retrieves selected data and prints it on the terminal.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   specifies that every row of information is to be displayed without
   querying the user (DEFAULT -- 10 lines).
-col_widths W1 ... Wn, -cw W1 ... Wn
   specifies the width of each column to be printed.  Wi may be an
   integer or may be P.Q where P and Q are precision and scale (DEFAULT
   -- determined from database descriptions).  Asterisks are printed if
   the retrieved data cannot be printed in the column widths specified.
-col_widths_truncate W1 ... Wn, -cwt W1 ... Wn
   identical to the -cw control argument except that truncation occurs
   in cases where the retrieved data contains more characters than the
   column widths specified.


-max N
   specifies that no more than N lines are to be printed without the
   user's permission (DEFAULT -- 10 lines).
-no_header, -nhe
   specifies that column headers are not to be printed (DEFAULT --
   print column headers).
-no_end, -ne
   specifies that the string "(END)" is not to be printed after the
   last piece of retrieved data is printed (DEFAULT -- print the
   "(END)" string).


Notes:
Columns are printed side-by-side and there is no pagination.  If
-col_widths is specified, a width must be specified for every column.
