12/01/86 set_scope, ss


Syntax: ss table_name1 permit_ops1 prevent_ops1 {...  table_nameN
                       permit_opsN prevent_opsN} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active request: [ss table_name1 permit_ops1 prevent_ops1
         {... table_nameN permit_opsN prevent_opsN} {-control_arg}]


Function:  defines a current scope of access to the data base for
nonexclusive opening modes.  This request and the del_scope request are
the means through which the user defines requirements to the linus
concurrent access control mechanism.  Every table that the user wishes
to access for a given period must be included within the user's scope
of access for that same period.  As an active request, it returns
"true" if the scope was set and "false" if the scope was not set.


Arguments:
table_namei
   the name of a nontemporary table within the data base that is to be
   included in the current scope of access.
permit_opsi
   is a character string indicating which types of data base operations
   are to be permitted the user who is setting scope for the
   corresponding table.  The character string is the concatenation of
   the codes for all operations to be permitted.
prevent_opsi
   is a character string similar to that for permit_opsi indicating
   which types of data base operations are to be denied other users for
   the corresponding table.


Control arguments:
-time seconds, -tm seconds
   specifies time in seconds that the user is willing to wait for the
   scope to become available (DEFAULT -- 900 seconds).


Notes:  Operation codes are:  "r" (retrieve), "m" (modify), "d"
(delete), "s" (store), and "n" (null).  The current scope of access
must be empty when a set_scope is requested.
