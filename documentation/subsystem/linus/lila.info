Syntax:  lila {-control_args}


Function: invokes the LINUS Language (LILA) editor and translator.


Control arguments: 
-build {START} {INCREMENT}
   invokes LILA build mode, an automatic numbering mode, in the current
   LILA text file.  START determines  the  first  line  number  of  the
   inserted  text.   INCREMENT, when added to the previous line number,
   yields the next automatic line number.  A value for  START  must  be
   given  if  an  INCREMENT  is  to  be given.  START and INCREMENT are
   positive integers ranging from 1 to 9999.  Build mode is  exited  by
   entering a line consisting of a period (".").  (DEFAULT INCREMENT is
   10.  DEFAULT START is the current last line_number  plus  INCREMENT.
   For  an empty lila file, the DEFAULT for both START and INCREMENT is
   10.) NOTE: Build mode overwrites any existing text line which has  a
   line  number  equal to any automatically generated line number.  For
   example: if the file contains lines  10,  20,  30,  ...,  the  LINUS
   request "lila -build 15 15" would insert line 15, overwrite line 30,
   insert line 45, etc.


-new
   deletes all lines from the LILA text file which remain from previous
   invocations of LILA in the current LINUS session.   (DEFAULT  is  to
   keep the old text lines).


Requests:
build {START} {INCREMENT}
   invokes build mode in the current lila text file. (See -build above.)
invoke macro_path {optional_args}, i macro_path {optional_args}
   causes the requests in the designated segment to be executed.
line_number
   deletes a LILA source line.
line_number source_line
   adds or replaces a LILA source line.
list, ls
   prints the current LILA source file.
list_requests, lr
   prints a brief summary of available lila requests.


new 
   deletes all text from current lila text file.
proc
   processes the current LILA source file to form the specification of
   the database subset which is to be accessed by subsequent LINUS
   database requests.
quit, q
   exits from LILA and returns to LINUS request level.
save macro_path, sv macro_path
   stores the current LILA file as a LINUS macro in the designated
   segment with a ".linus" suffix.


Notes: 

If  you  type  a dot (.), LINUS will let you know whether you are
at LINUS request level or in the LILA  editor.   If  you  type  a
question mark (?), LILA will print a brief list of requests.

Multics command lines maybe executed by typing "execute command_line"
or "e command_line" or "..command_line".

Refer to the LINUS manual (Order No. AZ49) for complete information on
LILA syntax.  The following sections provide examples of typical LILA
expressions.


Examples: 
The following examples reference a database containing the following
five tables:

emp (name, empno, dept, mgr, sal, comm)
sales (dept, item, vol)
supply (supplier, item, vol)
loc (dept, floor)
class (item, type)

The LILA syntax basically consists of constructing various
combinations of SELECT-FROM-WHERE blocks as shown.

select dept
from emp

***


Further examples:
select *
from emp
where sal > 8000

***

select name sal
from emp
where dept = "Toy" & mgr = 1423

***

select name
from emp
where dept = "Admin" | sal + comm > 10000


More examples:
select item
from sales
where dept = {select dept
              from loc
              where floor = 2}

***

avg {select sal
     from emp
     where dept = "Shoe"}


Even more examples:
select name
from emp
where sal > max {select sal
                 from emp
                 where dept = "Shoe"}

***

select name sal - avg {select sal
                       from emp
                       where dept = "Shoe"}
from emp
where dept = "Shoe"


Still more examples:
select item
from supply
where supplier = "Levi"
inter
select item
from sales
where dept = "Men"

***

sum {select vol
     from sales
     where item = {select item
                   from class
                   where type = "A"}
     & dept = {select dept
               from loc
               where floor = 2}}


Final examples:
sum {select vol
     from sales
     where sales.item = class.item & class.type = "A"
          & sales.dept = loc.dept & loc.floor = 2}

***

select x.name y.name
from x:emp y:emp
where x.mgr = y.emp_no & x.sal > y.sal
