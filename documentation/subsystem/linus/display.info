12/01/86   display, di

Syntax:  display {-control_args}


Function:  retrieves selected data, creates a report, and displays it
on the terminal, to a file, or an io switch.  A translated or
translatable query must be available.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   specifies that every page of the report is to be displayed.  This
   argument is incompatible with -pages.  -all is the default.
-brief, -bf,
   suppresses warning messages.
-character_positions STR1 {STR2}, -chpsn STR1 {STR2}
   where STR1 and STR2 define the left and right character positions of
   a vertical section of the report.  STR1 must be given and defines
   the left margin position to begin from.  STR2 is optional, and if it
   is not given the default is the rightmost character position of the
   report.  If this control argument is not given the entire page is
   printed.
-discard_report, -dsrp
   deletes the report on termination.  -discard_report is the default.


-discard_retrieval, -dsr
   deletes retrieved data on termination.
-enable_escape_keys, -eek
   specifies that display is to use the escape keys sequences, rather
   than the terminal's function keys and arrow keys, for the scrolling
   functions.  This is the default if the -scroll control argument is
   given and the terminal doesn't have the necessary set of function
   keys and arrow keys (see -enable_function_keys below.)  (In the
   following description the mnemonic "esc-" means the terminal's
   escape key.)  The following escape key sequences are used if this
   control argument is given, or, the terminal lacks the necessary set
   of keys:  forward -- esc-f; backward -- esc-b; left -- esc-l; right
   -- esc-r; help -- esc-?; set_key -- esc-k; set_scroll_increment --
   esc-i; quit -- esc-q; redisplay -- esc-d; start_of_report -- esc-s;
   end_of_report -- esc-e; multics_mode -- esc-m; and goto -- esc-g.


-enable_function_keys, -efk
   specifies that display is to try to use the terminal's function keys
   and arrow keys for the scrolling functions.  This is the default
   when the -scroll control argument is given and the terminal has at
   least nine function keys and the four arrow keys.  (In the following
   description the mnemonic:  "fN" means function key N, where N is the
   number of the function key; "down_arrow" means the down arrow key;
   "up_arrow" means the up arrow key; "left_arrow" means the left arrow
   key; and "right_arrow" means the right arrow key.)  The following
   key sequences are used if this control argument is given and the
   terminal has the necessary set of keys:  forward -- down_arrow;
   backward -- up_arrow; left -- left_arrow; right -- right_arrow; help
   -- f1; set_key -- f2; set_scroll_increment -- f3; quit -- f4;
   redisplay -- f5; start_of_report -- f6; end_of_report -- f7;
   multics_mode -- f8; and goto -- f9.


-extend
   specifies that when the -output_file control argument is used and
   the file exists, the report is appended to the end of the file
   rather than replacing it.  If this control argument isn't used the
   default is to truncate an existing file.
-keep_report, -krp
   keeps the report on termination.  This control argument is necessary
   in order to use -old_report on subsequent invocations of display.
-keep_retrieval, -kr
   keeps retrieved data to allow re-use on subsequent invocations of
   the display request.  Previously retrieved sorted data retains the
   sort order.


-long, -lg
   displays warning messages when a control argument such as
   -old_retrieval is used and the data from a previous retrieval is not
   available.  (Default)
-new_report, -nrp
   specifies that display is to create a new report.  ("-new_report" is
   the default)
-new_retrieval, -nr
   specifies that display should begin a new retrieval from the data
   base.  (-new_retrieval is the default)
-old_report, -orp
   uses the report created in the previous invocation.  Use of this
   control argument requires that -keep_report be used in the prior
   invocation of display.


-old_retrieval, -or
   uses data retrieved during the previous invocation.  Use of this
   control argument requires that -keep_retrieval be used in the prior
   invocation of display.
-output_file path, -of path
   where path is the name of the file which will contain the formatted
   report.  If this argument and -output_switch are not given the
   report is displayed on the terminal.  This argument is incompatible
   with -output_switch.
-output_switch switch_name, -osw switch_name
   where switch_name is the name of a switch which will be used to
   display the report.  It is an error to use this control argument if
   the named switch is not already open and attached when display is
   invoked.  This argument is incompatible with -output_file.


-pages STR, -pgs STR, -page STR, -pg STR
   where STR is a blank separated list of pages (N N) or page ranges
   (N,N).  Page ranges can also be given as "N," or "N,$" which means
   from page N to the end of the report, or $ which means the last
   page.  This argument is incompatible with "-all".
-passes N, -pass N
   where N is the number of times the report will be formatted.  If
   this control argument isn't given the default value for N is 1.  No
   output is produced until the last formatting pass of the report.


-scroll
   specifies that display is to scroll the report according to key
   sequences read from the terminal.  Only terminals supported by the
   Multics video system can use the scrolling feature.  If the -window
   control argument isn't used, display will create a uniquely named
   window for the display of the report.  The user_i/o window will be
   reduced to four lines and the remaining lines will be used for the
   uniquely named report display window.  The minimum size for this
   window is five lines, so the user_i/o window must be at least nine
   lines before invoking display, unless the -window control argument
   is used.


-set_key STR, -sk STR
-set_keys STR, -sks STR
   specifies that the named scrolling functions are to be set to the
   provided key sequences.  STR is a blank separated list of one or
   more scrolling function names and key sequences, given as
   "function_name key_sequence ...  {function_name key_sequence}".  The
   function names can be chosen from the set listed above under the
   description of the "-enable_escape_keys" or "-enable_function_keys"
   control arguments.  The key sequences can be given as the actual
   sequences, or, mnemonic key sequences.  The provided mnemonic's can
   be:


      "fN" where N is the number of the desired function key; "esc-" or
      "escape-" where this corresponds to the terminal's "escape"
      character; "ctl-X" or "control-X" where this corresponds to the
      character sequence generated by the terminal when the "control"
      key is held while also pressing the character named by "X";
      "down_arrow" where this corresponds to the terminal's down arrow
      key; "up_arrow" where this corresponds to the terminal's up arrow
      key; "left_arrow" where this corresponds to the terminal's left
      arrow key; "right_arrow" where this corresponds to the terminal's
      right arrow key; and "home" where this corresponds to the
      terminal's home key.


-sort STR {-ascending | -descending} {-case_sensitive |
           -non_case_sensitive} ...  {STR {-asc | -dsc} {-cs | -ncs}}
   where STR is the name of a column as defined in the open
   model/submodel or a number corresponding to the position of the
   column in the selection expression.  It can be followed by
   -ascending or -descending, and -case_sensitive or
   -non_case_sensitive.  If -ascending or -descending is not specified,
   the default is -ascending.  If -case_sensitive or
   -non_case_sensitive is not specified, the default is
   -case_sensitive.


-temp_dir dir_name, -td dir_name
   specifies that the given directory should be used for storing the
   retrieved data, the saved report if "-keep_report" is used, and
   sorting workspace if "-sort" is used, instead of the process
   directory.  This temp dir will continue to be used until another new
   temp dir is requested.  A new temp dir can only be specified when a
   new retrieval and new report are requested.
-truncate, -tc
   specifies that when the -output_file control argument is used and
   the file already exists, the report replaces the contents of the
   file.  If the -extend control argument isn't given the default is
   -truncate.


-window STR, -win STR
   specifies that the window named by STR should be used for the
   display of the report.  This argument is only meaningful when the
   -scroll argument is also used.  If this control argument is used the
   window named by STR must be attached and open under the video
   system, and it must be at least five lines high.
