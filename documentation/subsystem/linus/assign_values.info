Syntax: av variable_list


Syntax as an active request: [av variable_list]


Function: retrieves selected data and assigns it to designated
LINUS variables.  As an active request it returns "true" if data
was sucessfully retrieved and "false" if the select statement
failed.


Arguments:
variable_list
   a list of one or more LINUS variable names (each name must
   begin with "!").


Notes:
Retrieved data is assigned to variables in the order that it is
retrieved.  Retrieval ceases when either the variable_list or
selected data is exhausted.  Variables which have no values to be
assigned to them will not be affected (eg.  values will not be
changed or variable will not be allocated).
