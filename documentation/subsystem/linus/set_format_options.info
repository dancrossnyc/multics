Syntax:  sfo {-format_option_args} {-control_args}


Function:  sets individual report format options to user specified or
default values, and/or all of the formatting options to their default
values.

The option value given for any format option argument can be the
control arguments "-default" or "-prompt".  If -default is given for
the value, LINUS will set the value of the format option to the system
default.  If -prompt is given for the value, LINUS will prompt for the
value with the prompt string "Enter FORMAT_OPTION_NAME.".  A line
consisting of the single character "."  will terminate the prompted
input mode.  To suppress the printing of the prompt string use the
-brief control argument.


Control arguments:

-brief, -bf, -long, -lg
   print/don't print the prompt string for values when the "-prompt"
   control argument is given.  The default is -long, which means prompt
   with the string "Enter FORMAT_OPTION_NAME".  If -brief and -long are
   both used on the request line, the last one supplied will be used.

-default
   specifies that LINUS should set the value of the format option which
   immediately precedes this control argument to the system supplied
   default.


-string STR, -str STR
   allows STR to be entered as a format option value when STR begins
   with a hyphen.

-prompt
   specifies that LINUS should prompt for the value of the format
   option which immediately precedes this control argument.  A prompt
   string will be written before the prompting action unless the -brief
   control argument is used.  A line consisiting of the single
   character "."  will terminate the prompted input mode.


-reset, -rs, -no_reset, -nrs
   reset/don't reset all formatting options to their system default
   values.  The default is -no_reset which means only the user
   specified options will have their values changed.  If -reset is
   given, all format options will be reset to their system default
   values before the values are changed for any other format options
   specified in the request line.  If -reset and -no_reset are both
   used on the request line, the last one supplied will be used.


Format Option Arguments (General Report Options):

-delimiter CHAR, -dm CHAR
   the character used to delimit the different portions of a header or
   footer.  The default character is "!".  This can be set to any
   printable character.

-format_document_controls STR, -fdc STR
   the value of -format_document_controls is used to determine if the
   format_document_ subroutine should interpret format document control
   lines when filling overlength text.  The default value for STR is
   "off" which means format_document_ will not check for control lines
   imbedded in the text.  STR can also be set to "on" which means
   format_document_ will interpret control lines in the text and
   provide special filling actions based on the imbedded control lines.


-hyphenation STR, -hph STR
   the value of -hyphenation is used to determine if hyphenation should
   be attempted when filling overlength character strings.  The default
   value for STR is "off" which means no hyphenation is attempted by
   default.  STR can also be set to "on" which specifies that
   hyphenation should be attempted.


-page_footer_value STR, -pfv STR
   the page footer placed at the bottom of each page.  The page footer
   can consist of more than one line, and each line can have a left,
   right, and center portion.  The individual portions of each line are
   delimited by the delimiter character.  Active requests found in the
   header are evaluated and their return value is placed into the
   header before folding and alignment takes place.  Portions of a
   header or footer whose length are zero have their space on the page
   redistributed to other portions whose lengths are not zero.  For
   example, if the page header contained only a center portion
   (!!Sample Center Portion!!), the text would be centered on the page,
   but would have the full page width available for the text.


   Similarly, a left portion or right portion only would be aligned to
   the left or right of the page, but would have the full page width
   available for placement of its text.  Two exceptions to this action
   are when the header or footer has a left, right, and center portion,
   and the left or right portion has a zero length (e.g.
   !left part!center part!!  or !!center part!right part!).  In these
   two cases the left or right part of the page is unavailable for
   placement of text; that is, the space is not redistributed to the
   other two portions.  If the redistribution of the available page
   width is not desired, the placement of a single blank into a portion
   will prevent the redistribution from taking place because the
   portion will have a length greater than zero (i.e.
   ! !Center Part! !).  The default value for STR is "" which means
   there is no page footer provided by default.


-page_header_value STR, -phv STR
   the page header placed at the top of each page.  Refer to the
   description of -page_footer_value for the content of a
   header/footer.  The default value for STR is "" which means there is
   no page header provided by default.

-page_length N, -pl N
   the length of each formatted page given as the number of lines.  N
   can be given as "0" or any positive integer.  "0" means that the
   report is not to be paginated and it is created as one continous
   stream.  The default value for N is "66".


-page_width N, -pw N
   the width of each formatted page given as the number of character
   positions.  N can be given as "0" or any positive integer.  "0"
   means that the page width will always be set by LINUS to be the
   exact width needed to contain all of the columns specified in the
   LILA selection-expression which are not excluded.  If N is greater
   than zero and the width for any column exceeds N, the column's width
   is automatically set to N.  The default value is "79" character
   positions.


-title_line STR, -tl STR
   the value of -title_line is used to determine whether a title line
   should be printed.  The default value for STR is "on" which means
   that a title line is printed at the top of each page.  STR can also
   be set to "off" to inhibit the printing of the title line.

-truncation STR, -tc STR
   the value of -truncation is used to determine the character(s) that
   should be used to indicate that truncation of some value has
   occured.  The default value for STR is "*".  STR can be set to any
   sequence of printable characters.


Format Option Arguments (General Column Options):

-column_order COLUMN_LIST, -co COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -column_order is used to determine the order that the
   columns should appear in the detail line.  The default value for
   COLUMN_LIST is the list of columns from the LILA
   selection-expression in the order supplied.  This means that the
   columns will appear in the exact same order as they appear in the
   LILA selection-expression.  COLUMN_LIST can be set to a list of
   column names or numbers.  Columns missing from this list will be
   placed after the columns which appear in the list.  That is, if five
   columns were selected and the -column_order value had been given as
   "3 2", the complete order would be "3 2 1 4 5".


-count COLUMN_LIST, -ct COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -count is used to determine the columns counts should
   be generated for.  The default value for COLUMN_LIST is "" which
   means no columns should have counts generated.  COLUMN_LIST can be
   set to a list of column names or numbers.  Counts are generated
   after the last detail line.  If a count is requested on a column
   that is excluded, the count is also excluded from the page.  An
   exception to this rule is when all columns have been excluded.
   Counts are provided in this case to allow reports consisting of some
   combination of counts, subcounts, totals, and subtotals only.


-exclude COLUMN_LIST, -ex COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -exclude is used to determine if any of the columns
   selected via LILA should be excluded from the detail line.  The
   default value for COLUMN_LIST is "" which means no columns should be
   excluded.  COLUMN_LIST can be set to a list of column names or
   numbers.


-group COLUMN_LIST, -gr COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -group is used to group a number of rows based on the
   values of one or more columns.  The default value for COLUMN_LIST is
   "" which means no group of rows has been defined.  COLUMN_LIST can
   be set to a list of column names or numbers.  The column or columns
   named in the list become a hierarchy of columns.  The first column
   named is the most major column, and the last column named becomes
   the most minor column.  The hierarchy of columns can be used with
   the -outline, -page_break, -subtotal and -subcount options as
   described under each option's description.


-group_footer_trigger COLUMN_LIST, -gft COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -group_footer_trigger is used to determine when to
   generate the group footer.  The default value for COLUMN_LIST is ""
   which means no group footer triggers are defined by default.
   COLUMN_LIST can be set to a list of column names or numbers.  The
   columns which appear in this list must also appear in the column
   list associated with the -group option.  If the -group option is set
   to a new value, columns which are eliminated from the COLUMN_LIST
   are also eliminated from the -group_footer_trigger COLUMN_LIST.
   When any of the columns specified in the COLUMN_LIST are about to
   change with the next row, the group footer is evaluated.  The group
   footer is always evaluated after the last row of the report.


-group_footer_value STR, -gfv STR
   the group footer placed after each group of rows when any of the
   columns associated with the -group_footer_trigger option changes.
   Refer to the description of -page_footer_value for the content of a
   header/footer.  The default value for STR is "" which means there is
   no group footer defined by default.


-group_header_trigger COLUMN_LIST, -ght COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -group_header_trigger is used to determine when to
   generate the group header.  The default value for COLUMN_LIST is ""
   which means no group header triggers are defined by default.
   COLUMN_LIST can be set to a list of column names or numbers.  The
   columns which appear in this list must also appear in the column
   list associated with the -group option.  If the -group option is set
   to a new value, columns which are eliminated from the COLUMN_LIST
   are also eliminated from the -group_header_trigger COLUMN_LIST.
   When any of the columns specified in the COLUMN_LIST have just
   changed with the current row, the group header is evaluated.  The
   group header is always evaluated before the first row of the report.


-group_header_value STR, -ghv STR
   the group header placed before each group of rows when any of the
   columns associated with the -group_header_trigger option changes.
   Refer to the description of -page_footer_value for the content of a
   header/footer.  The default value for STR is "" which means there is
   no group header defined by default.


-outline COLUMN_LIST, -out COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -outline is used to determine if duplicate values in a
   column should be suppressed.  The default value for COLUMN_LIST is
   "" which means no columns should have duplicate values suppressed.
   COLUMN_LIST can be set to a list of column names or numbers.  If the
   value of a named column is the same as its previous value, then the
   value will be suppressed unless it is the first line of a new page.

   If any of the named columns are a member of the "group" of rows
   defined by the -group option, then it and all of the columns more
   major in this group have outlining done on them.  A change in value
   of any one column causes all columns lower in the hierarchy to have
   their values displayed, in addition to the column that changed.  An
   exception to this is if it is the first line on a new page, when
   duplicate values are never suppressed.


-page_break COLUMN_LIST, -pb COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -page_break is used to determine when page breaks
   should be generated.  The default value for COLUMN_LIST is "" which
   means that no columns are watched for page breaks.  COLUMN_LIST can
   be set to a list of column names or numbers.  The columns specified
   in the list are watched and when their values change, a break to a
   new page is generated.  If any of the named columns are a member of
   the "group" of rows defined via the -group option, it and all
   columns more major in the group will be watched for page breaks.

-row_footer_value STR, -rfv STR
   the row footer placed after each detail line.  Refer to the
   description of -page_footer_value for the content of a
   header/footer.  The default value for STR is "" which means there is
   no row footer provided by default.


-row_header_value STR, -rhv STR
   the row header placed before each detail line.  Refer to the
   description of -page_footer_value for the content of a
   header/footer.  The default value for STR is "" which means there is
   no row header provided by default.


-subcount SUBCOUNT_SPEC, -stt SUBCOUNT_SPEC
   the value of subcount is used to determine what columns subcounts
   should be generated for, when they should be generated, and what
   type of subcount should be generated.  The default value for
   SUBCOUNT_SPEC is "" which means no subcounts should be generated for
   any columns.  SUBCOUNT_SPEC can consists of one or more blank
   separated "triplets".  The syntax of a triplet is
   "column_1,column_2{,reset | running}".  column_1 is the name or
   number of the column that a subcount will be generated for.
   column_2 is the name or number of a column whose value should be
   watched to determine when to generate the subcount.  When the value
   of this column being watched changes, the subcount is generated.  If
   this column is a member of the "group" of rows defined via the
   -group option, it and all columns more major in the group will be
   watched for subcount generation.


   "reset" or "running" indicates the type of subcount desired.  If
   neither is given then "reset" is the default.  "reset" means the
   subcount counter will be reset to zero each time a subcount is
   generated.  "running" means the subcount will not be reset to zero.
   If a subcount is requested on a column that is excluded, the
   subcount is also excluded from the page.  An exception to this rule
   is when all columns have been excluded.  Subcounts are provided in
   this case to allow reports consisting of some combination of counts,
   subcounts, totals, and subtotals only.


-subtotal SUBTOTAL_SPEC, -stt SUBTOTAL_SPEC
   the value of subtotal is used to determine what columns subtotals
   should be generated for, when they should be generated, and what
   type of subtotal should be generated.  The default value for
   SUBTOTAL_SPEC is "" which means no subtotals should be generated for
   any columns.  SUBTOTAL_SPEC can consists of one or more blank
   separated "triplets".  The syntax of a triplet is
   "column_1,column_2{,reset | running}".  column_1 is the name or
   number of the column that a subtotal will be generated for.
   column_2 is the name or number of a column whose value should be
   watched to determine when to generate the subtotal.  When the value
   of this column being watched changes, the subtotal is generated.  If
   this column is a member of the "group" of rows defined via the
   -group option, it and all columns more major in the group will be
   watched for subtotal generation.


   "reset" or "running" indicates the type of subtotal desired.  If
   neither is given then "reset" is the default.  "reset" means the
   subtotal counter will be reset to zero each time a subtotal is
   generated.  "running" means the subtotal will not be reset to zero.
   If a subtotal is requested on a column that is excluded, the
   subtotal is also excluded from the page.  An exception to this rule
   is when all columns have been excluded.  Subtotals are provided in
   this case to allow reports consisting of some combination of counts,
   subcounts, totals, and subtotals only.


-total COLUMN_LIST, -tt COLUMN_LIST
   the value of -total is used to determine the columns totals should
   be generated for.  The default value for COLUMN_LIST is "" which
   means no columns should have totals generated.  COLUMN_LIST can be
   set to a list of column names or numbers.  Totals are generated
   after the last detail line.  If a total is requested on a column
   that is excluded, the total is also exlcuded from the page.  An
   exception to this rule is when all columns have been excluded.
   Totals are provided in this case to allow reports consisting of some
   combination of counts, subcounts, totals, and subtotals only.


Format Option Arguments (Specific Column Options):

"column_id" in the following descriptions means the column name as
defined in the open model/submodel, the number of the column in the
LILA selection_expression, or a star name which is used to match column
names.

-alignment column_id STR, -al column_id STR
   the value of -alignment is used to determine the alignment of a
   column value within its display width.  "column_id" specifies which
   column the alignment applies to.  "STR" is the alignment mode and
   can be set to "center", "left", "right", "both", or "decimal N".


   The default value for STR depends upon the type of column selected
   via LILA.  Character and bit strings default to left alignment,
   decimal data with a non-zero scale defaults to decimal point
   alignment, and all other data types default to right alignment.  For
   decimal alignment, the decimal alignment position within the display
   width is given a default value.  This alignment position can be
   changed by the user by specifying the value as "decimal N", where N
   is the character position within the display width where the decimal
   point should be aligned.  The alignment mode of "both" specifies
   that the column value will be aligned to the left and rightmost
   character positions within its display width.  Text is padded by
   insertion of uniformly distributed whitespace if necessary.


-editing column_id STR, -ed column_id STR
   the value of -editing is used to specify additional editing that
   should be done to the column value before it is placed on the page.
   "column_id" specifies which column the editing applies to.  The
   default value for STR is "" which means additional editing should
   not be done.  Multics active functions and LINUS active requests are
   normally used to provide the additional editing.  For example, to
   place commas and dollar signs in a column called "salary", the
   string "[pic $99,999v.99 [column_value salary]]" could be specified
   as the editing value.  Refer to the description of the
   "column_value" request for its usage.


-folding column_id STR, -fold column_id STR
   the value of -folding is used to determine what type of action
   should occur when a column value exceeds its display width.
   "column_id" specifies which column the folding applies to.  The
   default value for STR is "fill" which means portions of the value
   which exceed the display width are moved down to the next line(s)
   until a correct fit is obtained.  STR can also be set to "truncate"
   which means the column's value is truncated to fit in the display
   width and the truncation character(s) is placed at the end of the
   value to indicate truncation has occurred.


-separator column_id STR, -sep column_id STR
   the value of -separator is used to separate a column from the next
   one following it.  The last column on a line does not have a
   separator.  "column_id" specifies which column the separator applies
   to.  The default value for STR is two blanks.  STR can be changed to
   any sequence of printable characters.


-title column_id STR, -ttl column_id STR
   the value of -title is placed above the column at the start of each
   page if the -title_line option is set to "on".  "column_id"
   specifies which column the title applies to.  The default value of
   STR is the name of the column taken from the open model or submodel.
   In the case of expressions the default value for STR is "eN", where
   N begins at 1 and is incremented by 1 for each additional expression
   found in the select list.  If the title isn't the same number of
   characters as the column's display width, the title is centered
   within the display width for its associated column.  If the value of
   title is wider than the columns display width it is filled or
   truncated to obtain a correct fit, depending on it's parent column's
   folding action.


-width column_id N, -wid column_id N
   the value of width is used to determine the display width for a
   column.  "column_id" specifies which column the width applies to.
   The default value for N is the width for the column derived from the
   open model or submodel.  The derived width will be the number of
   characters needed to contain the value after conversion from the
   data type found in the data base to character format.  N can be set
   to any positive integer.


Notes:

At least one format option argument or "-reset" must be specified.
Format option arguments and control arguments can be mixed freely in
the request line, but a control argument cannot be placed in between a
format option name and a format option value.  For example, "sfo
-page_width 80 -reset" is a valid request.  "sfo -page_width -reset 80"
is not valid.  If a value is to be set that begins with a hyphen, the
control argument "-string" must be given before the value to
distinguish it from control arguments and format option arguments.


Examples:

set_format_options -width 1 25
set_format_options -title emp_name "Employee Name"
set_format_options -reset -page_width 80 -page_length 60
set_format_options -page_footer_value
                  "!!-[display_builtins page_number]-!!"


set_format_options -page_header_value -prompt
Enter -page_header_value.
