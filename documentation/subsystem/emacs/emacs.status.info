Major Projects:

012 79.02.06  5 20  F: COBOL mode.  Problem is nobody knows what it
		should do.
011 79.02.05  5 30  F: Have a "tags" (multi-language label-cataloguing)
		package.  No particular problem, just work.
010 79.01.02  6 30  F: Have a completing reader.  Problem is large amount
		of engineering and implementation work, and prerequisite
		of MP 009.
009 79.01.02  8 20  F: Organized cataloguing and argument checking on
		extended commands.  Problem is design.
008 78.12.19  7 35  R: Support underlining on "field-type" video TTY's.
		Same problems as Major Project 007.

007 78.12.19  8 28  R: Support overstriking on printing, TV, and other
		^H-recognizing terminals.  Problem is overhaul of
		redisplay data and control structure, specif. detabbify.
006 78.11.28  9 50  F: Keep buffers in non-PDIR place, optionally, for 
		safety".  Problem is Lisp representation of buffers.
005 78.09.21  9 25  F: Start_up files in some non-Lisp ASCII format.  Problem
		is designing and implementing a robust reader/evaluator
		that gives credible diagnostics.
004 78.09.21  8 20  F: Redesign/reimplement option mechanism.  Problems are
		lack of info on options in autoload files not yet loaded,
		and concomitant lack of error checking.

003 78.09.13  6 15  F: Speedtype improvements.  Problem is lack of save/edit
		ability, bugs in hashing algorithm, integration with native
		Multics Speedtype.
002 78.08.30  8 25  R: Synchronize with or abort output.  Problem is too much
		typeout, waiting for unwanted redisplays.  Difficulties
		are needed MCS features, and inconsistent partial screens.
001 78.08.23  8 30  R: Substantially improve printing terminal redisplay.
		Largest problems are middle-of-line edits, asynchrony
		in deciding what to print, too much typeout.


Other tasks:
001*79.02.06  8  9  CI: Install new Lisp; update macros to use unwind-protect.
		Problems are paperwork, exposure.
002 79.02.06 10 30  D: Finish user documentation (emacs_tutorial.info).
003*79.02.06  4  2  Update Emacs on CISL, incl. vfile.
004*79.02.06  2  5  Support ADDS980 terminal in Arizona.
005*79.02.06  9  2  Upgrade to MCS echo negotiation.  (Yet to debug new
		interrupt synchronization under mcs_echo_neg as well).


Explanations of categories and markings:

* indicates that the bug has been fixed.
Bug categories are:  F - fundamental emacs; CI - command interface;
R - redisplay; PL1 - PL/1 mode; L - Lisp mode; M - Mail/message subsystems;
D - Documentation/auto-doc; T - terminal/network support.


Definitions:

A "bug" is a user-visible deficiency causing unexpected results, loss of
display or data, or useless output or display, or action at variance with the
documentation.  Severity and estimated difficulty are rated on a scale of 1 to
10.  10 is the most urgent and hardest.

A suggestion is a suggested design augmentation or modification that is open
to debate about relative merit;  it is not a bug fix.  Suggestions do not
include missing isolatable sub-subsystems.  Suggestions requiring major
redesign or new implementation are listed under "Major projects", and do not
qualify as suggestions.

A major project is a design/implementation enhancement involving substantial
redesign and reimplementation, or the implementation of an entirely new
subsystem within Emacs.
