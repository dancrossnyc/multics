     The Emacs mail system provides a facility for reading, sending, and
responding to Multics mail within Emacs, utilizing the standard Emacs features
and the interfaces of the Multics mail system.  Known deficiencies/misfeatures
will be detailed below.  RMAIL is modeled after ITS RMAIL.

     ------------------------------ ------------------------------

     There are two basic functions, sending mail and reading mail.  The Emacs
command for sending mail is

	^XM	send-mail

Issuing this command will prompt for a "Subject", which should be supplied,
terminated by a carriage return.  This subject will be incorporated into the
buffer name, so it should be short.  A buffer will be formatted up with the
mail in it, header prefabricated.  The buffer will be placed  in an available
window (like ^X^E (comout) does).  Fill mode will be turned on with a fill
column of 72.  The buffer is now in MAIL mode, which defines the following
commands:

    ^XA	mail-append.  Go to the end of the body of the mail. Use this to
	start inputting the text after you have set the destination, or
	to go back to the text after editing some header field.

    ^XT   mail-to.  Go to the end of the "To:" line, to add a recipient.
	You will be left here when the MAIL buffer is entered, to enter
	the first recipient.  Then use ^XA to continue. Separate
	recipients (like all header fields) with commas, i.e.,

	To:	Washington.States, Consultant.c

    ^XF   mail-from. Go to the end of the "From:" line, to edit it, or
	add more sender's names.

    ^XJ   mail-subject.  Go to the end of the "Subject:" line, to edit it.

    ^XC   mail-cc. Go to the end of the "Cc:" (carbon copy recipients)
	line, making one if there is none, so that you can type in the
	destination of a carbon copy recipient.

    ^XY   mail-reply-to. Generate a "Reply-To" field, if none exists,
	and go to it.  The destination put here will be used for replies
	if a recipient of your mail uses RMAIL (or another mail system) to
	automatically reply to your message.

    ^X^S  send-the-mail.  Send the buffer to the recipients specified in the
	header.  The relative success of the sendings will be displayed as
	local output (2 linefeeds to restore display).

    ESC-^F forward-mail-field.  Move forward one recipient, cc recipient, etc.
	 on this (header) line.  Circles around at end.

    ESC-^B backward-mail-field.  Move backward one recipient, cc recipient,
	 etc. on this (header) line. Circles around at end.

    ESC-^D delete-mail-field.  Delete, including necessary commas, the
	 single header item (recipient, etc.) that the cursor is on.

    ^XL   rmail-logger-append.  Log the message into a file, placing it at
	the end, separated by a formfeed. With an argument, or the first
	time, the pathname of the log file is prompted for.  Otherwise,
	the same file last used by ^XL or ^XP is used.

    ^XP   rmail-logger-append.  Same as ^XL, but puts message at the front
	of the file.

     Three forms of recipient (or cc recipient) destinations are accepted:

	Jones.States		(standard Multics person.project)
	Jones			(link mailbox in Daemon mailbox dir)
	Mxyptlk at KRYPTON-KL10	(ARPANET address, PERSON at SITE)

     Parenthetical comments in destinations are ignored, thus:

	Muhammad (I am the Greatest) Ali at (the) WBA

gets set to "Muhammad Ali" at Site WBA, as per RFC 733. Quote processing
is done, too, and a field between <> brackets makes all outside it
(in a given address) a comment (as per RFC 733, which is visible
on Multics as mail_format.gi.info).

     Net mail sending is done via the Network Mailer Daemon; net connect
access is NOT required; you should be prepared for an acknowledgement message
from the Mailer Daemon.

     Your name will be given as

	From:	Destructo.CHAOS

or, if this site is on the ARPANET

	From:	Destructo.CHAOS  at RANDUM-MULTIX

If RMAIL knows your real name, you will get

	From:	Myron P. Destructo <Destructo.CHAOS at RANDUM-MULTIX>

RMAIL knows your name if either your site Emacs expert has placed it in the
"rmail-full-name-table" in the "emacs environment directory" (see him or her
about this) or if you have a form setting "my-personal-name" in your startup,
e.g.,

	(setq my-personal-name "Myron P. Destructo")

     If the Lisp variable "mail-mode-hook" is bound by the user, the atomic
symbol to which it is bound will be called as a function with no arguments
whenever a mail-mode buffer is created.  This be used to set mail-mode key
bindings.

     ------------------------------ ------------------------------

     Mail reading is performed via the command

	^XR	rmail

By default, mail is read in your personal default mailbox,
>udd>your-project>you>you.mbx.  If ^XR is given an argument, e.g., ^U^XR, the
"mailbox name" is prompted for.  This may take any of the forms

	Person.Project
	<pathname>	(with or without ".mbx" suffix)
	Person		(if a link to Person.mbx exists in the ARPANET
			 mailbox link directory)

If you have no mail in the selected mailbox, a message will be issued to this
effect.  Otherwise, the first message in the mailbox will be displayed in a
buffer, in RMAIL mode.  This buffer is read-only;  the following extra
commands (all normal commands are here too) apply in RMAIL mode:  NB:  these
are mostly NOT control characters, but regular characters!:  (note also
that numeric araguments may be typed directly, e.g., 3 g to go
to message 3, without ESC or ^U):


   n	Move on to the next message.
   p	Move back to the previous message.
   l	Move to the last message in your mailbox.
   g	Move to message number (argument), i.e.,
	3 g  to go to message # 3.
   j      Same as g.
   d	Delete (i.e., queue for deletion when rmail is exited)
	this message, move on to next undeleted message.
   D	Same as d, but moves backward.
   u	Undelete the last (stacked) deleted message.
   c      Copy the message to some other mailbox.  A mailbox name will
	be prompted for; anything acceptable to ^XR (as above) is ok.
   q	Quit out of rmail, returning to buffer from which
	rmail was invoked, deleting all messages marked for
	deletion.
   s	Summarize (as local output) all undeleted messages.
	May take a little time for full mailboxes.
   ^XL    Log the message to an ASCII file, at the end of the file.
	See the description above under the mail-sending commands.
   ^XP    Same as ^XL, but "prepends" to the front.  See the description
	above under mail-sending commands.

   m      Send mail, not necessarily a reply (see r).  Indentical to
	^XM, send-mail, but ESC-^Y, ^X^Q and ^X^S are defined as below
	for the r command, for convenience while RMAIL'ing.

   r      Reply to sender, via MAIL mode.  Formats up a MAIL mode buffer to
	reply to the current message, copying the subject (if any), or
	making one up, and setting up as a destination the sender's address
	that he/she would like to be responded to at. With a numeric
	argument, i.e, 1r, responds to other recipients as well:
	we do not do so by default.  This command is EXTREMELY effective
	in 2-window mode, in which case the response will be put in the
	other window, and ESC-^V (page-other-window) may be used to "page"
	the letter you are responding to as you respond.  When in RMAIL
	reply mode, (variant of MAIL mode set up for this purpose), the
	following three ADDITIONAL commands apply, other than the normal MAIL
	mode commands and the standard Emacs commands:

             ESC-^Y rmail-yank-mail

		Yanks the text and header of the original piece of
		mail being responded to, indented, by default, by
		4 (opt rmail-original-yank-indent controls this number).

	   ^X^Q	return-to-rmail

		returns to RMAIL, and its window  without sending the
		message.

	   ^X^S	send-from-rmail

		Actually sends the reply, and returns to RMAIL and its
		window.




     It is important to quit (q) out of RMAIL before leaving Emacs;  Messages
do not actually get deleted unless you quit out of RMAIL (or, equivalently,
answer "yes" to "All messages deleted.  Quit RMAIL?").

     If the Lisp variable "rmail-mode-hook" is bound by the user,
the atomic symbol to which it is bound will be called as a function with
no arguments before the first message is displayed.  This can
be used to set RMAIL-mode key bindings.

     ------------------------------ ------------------------------
People who receive a lot of mail from a lot of people and or
ARPAnet sites may want to set the variable "rmail-names-for-me"
in their startup.  This variable is set to a list of valid
addresses which should NOT be included among recipients of any
piece of mail generated by rmail-reply with an argument.
This is to prevent sending yourself mail.  Project names of
"*" as well as host names of "*" are permitted.

  Example:
    (setq rmail-names-for-me
    	'("bsg.*" "Greenberg.*" "BSG1.*" "Greenb1 @ Foo-Unix"
		"BSG @ *"))

By default, rmail-reply will suppress responding the the same
name as would be put in the From field by send-mail (^XM).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Current lossages, deficiencies, and unimplementeds (3/17/79)

1. We don't send mail acknowledgements.

2. We currently have no facility for forwarding mail.
