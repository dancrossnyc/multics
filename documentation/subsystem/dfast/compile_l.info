03/11/76   compile, com

Function:  The compile command compiles the current program into object
code by the BASIC or FORTRAN compiler.  The resultant object program
becomes the current file and can be executed immediately using the run
command or can be saved for subsequent execution.  The current file
must be saved before compilation.


The current name is changed, as follows, with respect to the source
program name.  If the source program name has a language suffix (e.g.,
prog.basic), the current name after compilation becomes the source name
with the suffix removed (e.g., prog).  If no suffix was used for the
source program (e.g., prog), the current name becomes "object."  If
errors are detected during compilation, error messages are issued by
the compiler and the source program is retained as the current file.


Syntax:  compile {system_name}


where system_name is basic, dbasic, or fortran.


If no argument is supplied, the current system is the value assumed.
For information on determining the current system, see "Current System"

Example:

!    rename test.basic
     ready  1100


!    compile
     compile: current segment must be saved
     ready  1100


!    save
     ready  1100


!    compile
     ready  1100


!    tty
     name = test,  system = basic,  user = Smith,  line = tty112
