Function:  The build command initiates an input mode for nonnumbered
lines of text that are appended directly to the current file.  Any text
in the alter file when build is given is merged before the new text is
appended.  (Notice that a DFAST command entered in this mode is simply
accepted as text.)  The build mode of input is terminated by typing a
line consisting of a newline.  When DFAST issues a ready message, the
normal command environment is restored.


Syntax:  build
