03/12/76   edit move, edit mov

Function:  The move request relocates specified lines within the
current file to a given location.  Relocated lines are placed after a
specified line number and assigned new line numbers by incrementing
that value by one.  For example, if three lines are moved to line 100,
they will be given the line numbers 101, 102, and 103.  If a sequence
of lines is moved so that their numbers would not fit between the line
specified and the line originally specified, succeeding lines are
resequenced with an increment of one until there is no overlap.


Syntax:  edit move line1 line2


where:

1.   line1          is a line or range of lines to be moved.

2.   line2          is the line after which line1 will be inserted.
