03/11/76   unsave, uns

Function:  The unsave command removes a saved file from the user's home
directory or from another directory, if specified in the file_name
argument.  An unsave can only be successful if the user has appropriate
access to the directory specified.  The save command is unlike scratch,
which removes the contents but leaves the file name in a directory.


Syntax:  unsave file_name


where file_name is the name of a saved file.


Example:

!    unsave test.basic
     ready  1620


!    old test.basic
     old:  segment is not saved
     ready  1620
