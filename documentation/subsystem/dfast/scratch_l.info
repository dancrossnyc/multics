03/11/76   scratch, scr

Function:  The scratch command empties either the current and alter
files or a saved file.  The current name and system are not affected.
If a saved file is scratched, its name is retained in the specified
directory but its contents are deleted.  In this case the current and
alter files are not affected.  To delete the name plus the contents,
the unsave command is used.


Syntax:  scratch {file_name}


where file_name is the name of a file saved in the home directory or
some other directory to which the user has deletion privileges.


Example:

!    tty
     name = test.basic,  system = basic,  user = Smith,  line = tty112
     ready  0730


!    scratch
     ready  0730


!    list current
     list:  current file is empty
     ready  0730


!    list alter
     list:  alter file is empty
     ready  0730


!    tty
     name = test.basic,  system = basic,  user = Smith,  line = tty112
     ready  0731
