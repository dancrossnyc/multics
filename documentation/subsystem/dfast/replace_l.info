03/11/76   replace, rep

Function:  The replace command saves the contents of the current file
in place of the contents of a previously saved file.  If the file_name
argument is supplied, the current file is saved under that name
regardless of the current name.  If no argument is supplied, the
current name is assumed and the current file replaces information
previously saved under that name.  If no saved file exists under either
name, an error message is issued.


Syntax:  replace {file_name}

where file_name is the name of a saved file.  If file_name is not
supplied, the current name is assumed.


Example:

!    replace
     ready  1404


!    replace test.basic
     ready  1404
