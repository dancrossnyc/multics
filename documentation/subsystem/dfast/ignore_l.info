03/11/76   ignore, ign

Function:  The ignore command discards line-numbered information in the
alter file rather than merging with information already stored as part
of the current file.  Generally, the alter file contains all
line-numbered information entered since the user last executed a
command that caused the alter file to be merged with the current file,
such as new, old, or replace.  The contents of the alter file can be
examined using the list command.
