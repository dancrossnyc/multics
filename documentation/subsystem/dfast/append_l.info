03/11/76   append, app

Function:  The append command appends all information currently
contained in the alter file to the current file; that is, information
is added at the end of the file instead of being merged into the
appropriate line-number sequence.


Prior to execution of an append command, the alter file contains all
information entered since the last command that caused a merge of the
alter and current files such as new, old, or replace.  After execution,
the alter file is empty.
