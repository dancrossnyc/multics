03/11/76   old

Function:  The old command retrieves a file that has previously been
saved either in the user's home directory or another directory to which
the user has access.  If the retrieval is successful, the saved file
replaces the current file and the alter file is cleared.  If the saved
file's name includes a language component, the system is changed to
that language.  Otherwise, the message "enter system:" is printed and
the user can type basic, dbasic, or fortran.


Syntax:  old {file_name} {system_name}

where:


1.   file_name      is the name of a saved file; if it is not supplied,
                    DFAST requests that the user type it in.

2.   system_name    sets the current system to basic, dbasic, or
                    fortran.


Example:

!    system basic
     ready  0102


!    old
     enter name: ! test.basic
     ready  0102


!    old tst.fortran
     system changed to fortran
     ready  0103


!    tty
     name=tst.fortran,  system=fortran,  user=Smith.Des,  line=tty112
     ready  0103


!    old >udd>Faculty>Jones>test.basic
     system changed to basic
     ready  0103


!    tty
     name=tst.basic,  system=basic,  user=Smith.Des,  line=tty112
     ready  0103
