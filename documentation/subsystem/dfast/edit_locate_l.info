Function:  The locate request causes the current file to be searched
for all occurrences of a specified text string.  Each line containing a
match for the string is printed.  If line number arguments are
supplied, the search is restricted to the lines given; otherwise the
entire file is searched.


Syntax:  edit locate /text_string/{line1 line2 ... lineN}


where:

1.   /              is the string delimiter.  Any character except
                    blank or tab can be used as the string delimiter so
                    long as it does not appear in the string itself.

2.   text_string    is the string of characters to be matched; any
                    character (including blank) except the delimiter
                    may be used.

3.   linei          is a single line or range of lines.

!    new sample
     ready  0707


!    210 if m>n then 260
!    220 next i
