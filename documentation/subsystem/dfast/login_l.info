Function:  The login command is used to gain access to the Multics
system.  First, the user must dial the appropriate number to activate
the terminal and wait until a message is printed by the answering
service.  The login command is actually a request to the answering
service to start the user identification and process creation
procedures.  Therefore, this command can only be issued from a terminal
connected to the answering service; that is, one that has just dialed
up, or one that has been returned to the answering service after a
session terminated with a hello command.


The login command requests a password from the user (and attempts to
ensure either that the password does not appear at all on the user's
terminal or that it is thoroughly hidden in a string of cover-up
characters).  The password is a string of one to eight letters and/or
integers associated with the Person_id.


After the user responds with his password, the Multics system looks up
the Person_id and the password in its tables and verifies that the
Person_id is valid and that the password given matches the registered
password.  If these tests succeed, and if the user is not already
logged in, the load control mechanism is consulted to determine if
allowing the user to log in would overload the system.


Syntax:  login Person_id {-control_args}


where:

1.   Person_id                is the user's registered personal
                              identifier.  This argument must be
                              supplied.


2.   control_args             can be selected from the following:

       -brief, -bf            suppresses messages associated with a
                              successful login.

       -change_password,      changes the user's password to a newly
       -cpw		given one.  Multics asks for the old one
		          before requesting the new.  If the old
			password is correct, the new password
			replaces it for subsequent logins and the
			message "password changed" is printed.
			The user should not type the new password
			as part of the control argument.

       -no_print_off, -npf    overtypes a string of characters to
                              provide a black area for the user to type
                              his password (necessary only for users
                              whose terminals do not have
                              print-suppression capabilities).

       -terminal_type XX,     sets the user's terminal type to XX,
       -ttp XX                where XX is one of the types listed for the
		          corresponding control argument of the
                              set_tty command.

       -modes XX              sets the modes for terminal I/O according
                              to XX.  For a description of this
                              argument, see the corresponding argument
                              of set_tty.


Examples:

In the examples below, the user's password is shown even though in
most cases Multics either prints a string of cover-up characters to
"hide" the password or temporarily turns off the printing mechanism of
the user's terminal.


Probably the most common form of the login request is to specify
just the Person_id and the password as:


!    login Jones
     Password:
!    mypass


To set the tabs and crecho I/O modes so the terminal uses tabs
rather than spaces where appropriate on output and echoes a carriage
return when a line feed is typed, type:


!    login Jones -modes tabs,crecho
     Password:
!    mypass


To change the password from mypass to newpass, type:


!    login Jones -cpw
     Password:
!    mypass
     New Password:
!    newpass
     Password changed.
