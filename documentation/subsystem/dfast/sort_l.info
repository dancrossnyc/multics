03/11/76   sort, sor

Function:  The sort command arranges the current file in ascending
sequence by line number.  When more than one line has the same line
number, the last one is retained.  Lines that are not numbered are
deleted.  Text in the alter file is merged before the sort is executed.
Since normal line-numbered input is automatically sorted, the sort
command is applicable only to files that have been created in some
other way (such as by a user program execution or with the build
command).
