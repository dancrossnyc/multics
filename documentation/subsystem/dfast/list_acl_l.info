Syntax:  list_acl {file_name} {User_ids} {-control_args}


where:

1.   file_name              identifies the file whose ACL is to be
                            listed.  If it is omitted, the home
                            directory is assumed and no User_ids can be
                            specified.  The star convention can be
                            used.

2.   User_ids               are access control names that must be of
                            the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL
                            entries with matching names are listed.
                            (For a description of the matching
                            strategy, refer to the set_acl command.)
                            If User_id is -a, -all, or omitted, the
                            entire ACL is listed.

3.   control_args           can be chosen from the following control
                            arguments:

       -all, -a             lists the entire ACL.  This argument
                            overrides any specified User_ids.

       -brief, -bf          suppresses the message "User name not on
                            ACL of file/directory."

       -directory, -dr      lists the ACLs of directories only.  The
                            default is files and directories.


Note:

If the list_acl command is invoked with no arguments, it lists the
entire ACL of the home directory.


Example:

!    list_acl notice.runoff .Faculty. Doe


lists, from the ACL of notice.runoff, all entries with Project_id
Faculty and the entry for Doe.*.*.

!    list_acl *.basic


lists the whole ACL of every file in the home directory that has a
two-component name with a second component of basic.


!    la -wd .Faculty. *.*.*


lists access modes for all entries on the home directory's ACL whose
Project_id is Faculty and for the *.*.* entry.
