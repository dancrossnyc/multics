03/11/76   catalog, cat

Function:  When a file is saved, its name and other information about
it is placed in the directory specified (by default, the user's home
directory).  To print information about the files in a single
directory, the user can issue a catalog command.  A variety of control
arguments allow the user to restrict the listing to a subset of files
and/or a subset of information.  When no arguments are given, the
command prints the name, access mode, and length for each file in the
home directory in the order in which they were created.  The star
convention is allowed (see "File Naming Conventions" in Section III).


Syntax:  catalog {file_names} {-control_args}


where:


1.   file_names                    are a subset of the files whose
                                   attributes are to be listed.
                                   Listing of information about these
                                   files depends on the control
                                   arguments given.

2.   control_args                  may be chosen from the arguments
                                   given below and supplied in any
                                   order.  The basic output format of
                                   catalog is a series of columns, each
                                   of which corresponds to an attribute
                                   of the file.  If no attributes are
                                   explicitly stated, name, access
                                   mode, and records used are printed.
                                   Otherwise, only the name and
                                   specified attributes are printed.
                                   Both totals and detailed information
                                   are printed unless the user
                                   specifies otherwise.  Files are
                                   printed in the order they occur
                                   unless the user explicitly requests
                                   a different order.

       -pathname path, -pn path    lists the contents of the directory
                                   specified by path; if this control
                                   argument is not supplied, the home
                                   directory is assumed.

       -name, -nm                  prints only the names column.

       -date_time_entry_modified,  prints the date and time the  file
       -dtem                       was last modified.

       -total, -tt                 prints only the heading line, giving
                                   the total number of files (Multics
                                   segments) and the sum of their
                                   sizes.

       -no_header, -nhe            omits all heading lines.


Example:

!    catalog

     Segments = 4, Lengths = 26.

     r w   10  test.basic
     rew    9  test
     r w    5  newfile
     r w    2  summary.basic


     ready  0910


!    catalog *.basic

     Segments = 2, Lengths = 12.

     r w   10  test.basic
     r w    2  summary.basic


     ready  0910


!    catalog *.basic -nm -nhe

     test.basic
     summary.basic


     ready  0911


!    catalog -tt

     Segments = 4, Lengths = 26.


     ready  0911
