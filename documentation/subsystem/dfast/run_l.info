03/11/76   run

Function:  The run command causes the current file to be executed.  The
file must begin with a main program.  It may be in source or object
form.  If the current file is an object program, it will be directly
executed.  If the system_name argument is supplied, the current system
is changed accordingly.  The contents of the current file are
unaffected.


If the current file (or any external subprogram file that it calls) is
in source form, it is compiled to produce a temporary object program,
which is then executed.  An external file must have been specified in a
BASIC or FORTRAN library statement within the user's program.


Syntax:  run {system_name}


where system_name can be basic, dbasic, or fortran.


Example:

!    old test.basic
     ready  907


!    run
     Your program types this
     when it runs.
     ready  907
