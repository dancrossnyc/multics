03/11/76   edit append, edit app

Function:  The append request combines two or more files specified by
the user.  Files are concatenated in the order specified without any
regard for their current line numbers.  The resultant file becomes the
current file and is resequenced with line numbers beginning at 100 and
incremented by 10 to derive subsequent numbers.  For BASIC programs (if
the system name is basic or dbasic), internal references to changed
line numbers are also changed.  This means that lines in one file
should not refer to line numbers in another file.


Syntax:  edit append file1 file2{ file3 ... fileN}


where each filei is a file name; at least two files must be specified.


Example:

!    new newfile.basic
     ready  1101


!    10  read x
!    20  if x=0  goto 10
!    30  print x
!    save
     ready  1101


!    new subr.basic
     ready  1101


!    10  read y
!    20  if y=0 goto 10
!    30  print y
!    40  end
!    save
     ready  1102


!    edit append newfile.basic subr.basic
     ready  1102


!    lisn
     100 read x
     110 if x=0 goto 100
     120 print x
     130 read y
     140 if y=0 goto 130
     150 print y
     160 end
     ready  1102
