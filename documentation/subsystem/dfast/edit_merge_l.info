03/12/76   edit merge, edit mer

Function:  The merge request combines two or more files according to
line number sequence.  The first file specified serves as the primary
file for merging; that is, the file into which all other specified
files will be merged.  Lines from subsequent files are inserted into
the primary file in the proper numerical sequence.  If duplicate lines
occur, the last one encountered during the merge is retained.  The
resulting file becomes the current file.


Syntax:  edit merge file1 file2{ file3 ... fileN}


where each filei specified is merged into file1.
