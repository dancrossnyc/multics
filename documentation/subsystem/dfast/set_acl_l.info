03/11/76   set_acl, sa

Function:  The set_acl command manipulates the access control lists
(ACLs) of files.  (See "Access Control" in Section III of the
M__u_l_t_i_c_s D_F_A_S_T_ S__u_b_s_y_s_t_e_m U__s_e_r_s'_ G__u_i_d_e (Order No. AT59)).



Syntax:  set_acl file_name mode1 {User_id1 ... modeN User_idN}


where:

1.   file_name           is the file whose ACL is to be affected.  The
                         star convention can be used.

2.   modei               is a valid access mode.  This can be any or
                         all of the letters rew.  Use null, "n" or ""
                         to specify null access.

3.   User_idi            is an access control name that must be of the
                         form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL
                         entries with matching names receive the mode
                         modei.  (For a description of the matching
                         strategy, see "Notes" below.)  If no match is
                         found and all three components are present, an
                         entry is added to the ACL.  If the last modei
                         has no User_id following it, the user's
                         Person_id and current Project_id are assumed.


Note:

The arguments are processed from left to right.  Therefore, the effect
of a particular pair of arguments can be changed by a later pair of
arguments.


The matching of access control name arguments is defined by three
rules:


      1.  A literal component, including "*", matches only a component
          of the same name.

      2.  A missing component not delimited by a period is treated the
          same as a literal "*" (e.g., "*.Multics" is treated as
          "*.Multics.*").  Missing components on the left must be
          delimited by periods.

      3.  A missing component delimited by a period matches any
          component.

Some examples of User_ids and which ACL entries they match are:


          *.*.*     matches only the literal ACL entry "*.*.*".

          Multics   matches only the ACL entry "Multics.*.*". (The
                    absence of a leading period makes Multics the first
                    component.)

          JRSmith.. matches any ACL entry with a first component of
          JRSmith.

          ..        matches any ACL entry.

          .         matches any ACL entry with a last component of *.

          ""        (null string) matches any ACL entry ending in
          ".*.*".


Examples:

!    set_acl *.basic rew *


adds to the ACL of every file in the home directory that has a
two-component name with a second component of basic an entry with mode
rew to *.*.* (everyone) if that entry does not exist; otherwise it
changes the mode of the *.*.* entry to rew.


!    sa alpha.basic rew .Faculty. r Jones.Faculty.


changes the mode of every entry on the ACL of alpha.basic with a middle
component of Faculty to rew, then changes the mode of every entry that
starts with Jones.Faculty to r.
