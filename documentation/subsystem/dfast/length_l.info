Function:  The length command prints the number of words in the current
file.  One word is equal to four characters (including punctuation,
spacing, and newline characters).  If the total number of characters is
not a multiple of four, the last word will contain fewer than four
characters.  The smallest unit of storage on Multics is a record.  A
record consists of 1024 words.  In the example shown, the user has used
one record even though only 12 words were required by the file.
