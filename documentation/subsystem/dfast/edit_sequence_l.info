03/12/76   edit sequence, edit seq

Function:  The sequence request adds a new set of line numbers to the
current file, beginning with a given line number and adding a given
increment to derive subsequent numbers.  If the file already has line
numbers, these are retained but become part of the text on the line.
If no increment is supplied, 10 is assumed.  If no arguments are
supplied, the first line number in the file will be 100.


Syntax:  edit sequence {first_num inc}


where:

1.   first_num      is the first line number (100 by default).

2.   inc            is the increment used to derive subsequent numbers
                    (10 by default).


Example:

!    build
!    nonnumbered
!    file
!    input
!

     ready  1503


!    edit sequence
     ready  1503


!    lisn
     100 nonnumbered
     110 file
     120 input
     ready  1503


!    edit sequence 500 5
     ready  1504


!    lisn
     500 100 nonnumbered
     505 110 file
     510 120 input
     ready  1504
