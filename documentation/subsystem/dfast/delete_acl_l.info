Function:  The delete_acl command removes entries from the access
control lists (ACLs) of files.  (See "Access Control" in Section III
of the M__u_l_t_i_c_s D_F_A_S_T_ S__u_b_s_y_s_t_e_m U__s_e_r_s'_ G__u_i_d_e (Order No. AT59)).



Syntax:  delete_acl {file_name} {User_ids} {-control_args}


where:

1.   file_name          is the name of the file whose ACL is to be
                        deleted.  If it is omitted, only a User_id of
                        -all or -a is allowed.  The star convention can
                        be used.

2.   User_ids           are access control names that must be of the
                        form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All ACL entries
                        with matching names are deleted.  (For a
                        description of the matching strategy, refer to
                        the set_acl command.)  If User_id is -a or
                        -all, the entire ACL is deleted with the
                        exception of an entry for *.SysDaemon.*.  If no
                        User_id is given, the user's Person_id and
                        Project_id are assumed.

3.   control_args       can be chosen from the following:

       -all, -a         causes the entire ACL to be deleted with the
                        exception of an entry for *.SysDaemon.*.

       -brief, -bf      suppresses the message "User name not on ACL."


Note:

An ACL entry for *.SysDaemon.* can be deleted only by specifying all
three components.  The user should be aware that in deleting access to
the SysDaemon project he prevents Backup.SysDaemon.* from saving the
segment or directory on tape, Dumper.SysDaemon.* from reloading it, and
Retriever.SysDaemon.* from retrieving it.


Example:

!    delete_acl news .Faculty. Jones


deletes from the ACL of news all entries with Project_id Faculty and
the entry for Jones.*.*.


!    da beta.** ..


deletes from the ACL of every file whose entryname has a first
component of beta all entries except the one for *.SysDaemon.*.
