03/11/76   save, sav

Function:  The save command saves the current file either in the user's
home directory or in a specified directory.  If no argument is
supplied, the file is saved under the current name in the home
directory.  If a pathname is given, the file is saved under the name
given and in the directory given; the current name is unaffected.


Syntax:  save {file_name}


where file_name identifies the file that is to be saved; if it is to be
in any directory other than the home directory, a pathname must be
supplied.


Example:

!    tty
     name = "no name",  system = basic,  user = Roy.Des,  line = tty112
     ready  0620


!    save >udd>ProjA>Roy>prog.fortran
     ready  0620


!    tty
     name="no name",  system=fortran,  user=Roy.Des,  line=tty112
     ready  0620


!    old prog.fortran
     ready  0620


!    tty
     name=prog.fortran, system=fortran, user=Roy.Des, line=tty112
     ready  0621


!    rename oldprog.fortran
     ready  0621


!    save
     ready  0621
