Function:  The insert request inserts files at given points in a
specified file.  The final result becomes the current file and is
resequenced beginning with line number 100 and incremented by 10 to
derive subsequent numbers.  For BASIC programs (if the system name is
basic or dbasic), internal references to changed line numbers are also
changed.


Syntax:  edit insert file1 file2 line1{ file3 line2 ... fileN lineN}


where:

1.   file1          is the file into which information is inserted.

2.   file2...fileN  are files to be inserted.

3.   line1...lineN  are line numbers in file1 after which the
                    associated files are to be inserted.
