02/18/85 reregister

Syntax as a command:  reregister volume_name drive_name


Function:  regenerates volume registration information.  This command
can be used in ring 1 only.


Arguments:
volume_name
   is the name of a physical volume.
drive_name
   has the form <subsys>_<nn>, e.g., dska_02.


Notes:  This command reads the label of the volume on the specified
drive name.  If it is a valid label for the volume whose name is given,
the registration data is refabricated from the label and the drive is
left in the known state.

This command should only be used to re-create logical volume
registration information if it has been lost because of a system crash
or other mishap.


The reregister command can re-create the logical volume registration,
physical volume registration, master directory control segment, and the
link to the access control segment.  If the registration data was
damaged, the system administrator should be informed so that he can run
the register_mdir command or correct any errors in the volume
registration.

Volumes that are accepted by bootload (the volumes listed on the root
config card) are registered automatically and cannot be registered
manually.
