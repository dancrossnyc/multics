:Info: salvage_dirs:  2020-01-22 salvage_dirs

Syntax as a command:  salvage_dirs


Function:  salvages the directory hierarchy.  The salvaging is
performed in the initializer process.  This command can be issued in
ring 1 only.  All physical volumes of the RLV must be accepted before
this command can operate.  If invoked, it attempts to mount all RLV
volumes.  This command should be used only during critical storage
system recovery operation.

Salvaging is normally performed automatically by the system when
needed.  If optional salvaging is desired (e.g., for directory
compaction) the x repair exec command should be used.
