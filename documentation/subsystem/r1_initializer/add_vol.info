04/21/86  add_vol, av

Syntax as a command:  av pv_name drive_name


Function:  tells the system that a physical volume is on a disk drive.
The system then reads and checks the volume label.  This command can be
used in ring 1 or ring 4.


Arguments:
pv_name
   is the name of a physical volume.
drive_name
   has the form <subsys>_<nn>{s}
   where:
     subsys is the disk subsystem name (dska)
     nn is the device number. (00 to 64)
     s is the subvolume name, for MSU3380 or MSU3390 (a,b, or c).
       example: dska_02 or dskb_00b.
   or drive_name may be -all to cause the system to read and check the
   labels of all assumed physical volumes.


Notes:  The registration file for volume_name is consulted to find out
the logical volume name and to validate the label.  The volume label is
read and checked.  If the label is correct the drive is left in the
known state.

If an add_lv command for the logical volume containing this physical
volume has been previously issued, and if this add_vol command
completes the logical volume, the logical volume is accepted for paging
and a message is printed.
