02/21/85  startup, star

Syntax as a command:  star


Function:  causes all logical volumes that were mounted at the time of
the last shutdown to be automatically mounted.  It also initializes the
answering service.  This command is usually the first thing you type
when you are bringing up Multics for a normal user session.  This
command can be used in ring 1 or ring 4.

All parts of the system_start_up.ec are executed in response to the
startup command.  Part 1 (those commands executed before the answering
service is started) is executed before answering service
initialization.  Part 2 (those commands executed after the answering
service is ready but before logins are accepted) is then executed; then
all terminal channels are instructed to answer.  After the terminal
channels have been started, part 3 (those commands executed after the
telephone lines are answered) is executed.
