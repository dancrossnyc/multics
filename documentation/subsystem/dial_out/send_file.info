Syntax:  !sf PATH {-control_args}

Function:
Send the contents of the given file to the foreign system as if it had been
typed by the user.


Arguments:
PATH
   is the pathname of the file to be sent.


Control Arguments:
-display_input, -dsin
   causes characters sent from the foreign host during the tranmission of
   this file to be displayed.  The default is to discard such foreign system
   transmissions.

-no_display_input, -ndsin
   undoes -display_input.


Notes:
The default operation of this request is to discard characters being sent 
from the foreign system, thus discarding echo of the file being sent.  If
the foreign system echo is slow, however, some echo may be seen once this 
request terminates.
