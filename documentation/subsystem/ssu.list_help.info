01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  list_help, lh

Syntax:  lh {topics}


Function:  displays the names of all subsystem info segments pertaining
to a given set of topics.


Arguments:
topics
   specifies the topics of interest.  Any subsystem info segment which
   contains one of these topics as a substring is listed.


Notes:
If no topics are given, all info segments available for the subsystem
are listed.

When matching topics with info segment names, an info segment name is
considered to match a topic only if that topic is at the beginning or
end of a word within the segment name.  Words in info segment names are
bounded by the beginning and end of the segment name and by the
characters period (.), hyphen (-), underscore (_), and dollar sign ($).
The ".info" suffix is not considered when matching topics.


Examples:
The request line:
   list_help list
will match info segments named list, list_users, and forum_list but
will not match an info segment named prelisting.
