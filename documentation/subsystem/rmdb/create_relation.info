12/20/86  create_relation, crr

Syntax:  crr relation_name {rel_attribute_list} {-control_args}


Function:  create a new relation in a data base.


Arguments:
relation_name
   is the name of the relation to be created.
rel_attribute_list
   is a list of the attribute names used in the relation.  The
   rel_attribute_list has the syntax of attr_1 attr_2 ...  attr_n
   (where "attr_"s are the attribute names of the attributes to be used
   for the relation).  The attribute names that are to make up the
   primary key of the relation must have an appended "*".  The
   rel_attribute_list cannot be used if the -selection_exp control
   argument is provided.


Control arguments:
-index STR, -ix STR
   specifies the list of attributes in the relation that are indexed.
   STR has the syntax of attr_1 attr_2 ...  attr_n (where "attr_"s are
   the attribute names of the attributes to be indexed).  If the
   -selection_exp control argument is used, the -index control argument
   must precede the -selection_exp control argument.
-selection_exp STR {select_values}, -se STR {select_values}
   STR is a selection expression that defines relation attributes that
   are to be created and populated using the data selected by the
   selection expression.  See "help mrds.selection_expressions" for the
   define_temp_rel selection expression specification.  The selection
   expression must be a separately quoted string with any select_values
   provided as individual arguments.  The -selection_exp control
   argument, if provided, must be the last control argument.
