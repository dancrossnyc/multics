Function:  creates an unreferenced domain in the currently readied data
base.


Arguments:
domain_name
   is the name of the domain to be created.
data_type
   is the underlying data type of the domain.  If the data_type
   contains spaces or parentheses, it must be quoted.  See the notes
   section below for a list of supported data types.


Control arguments:
-check_procedure path, -check_proc path
   performs data verification checks (such as ensuring valid dates)
   upon storage into the data base.  "path" may be an absolute or
   relative pathname.
-decode_declare data_type, -decode_dcl data_type
   is the underlying data type of the argument to the decode procedure
   for this domain.  See "Notes" for a list of supported data types.
-decode_procedure path, -decode_proc path

   to integers 1-50) before storage in an internal data base form.
   "path" may be an absolute or relative pathname.
