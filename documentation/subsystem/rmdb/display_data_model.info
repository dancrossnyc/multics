12/20/86  display_data_model, ddm, dmdm

Syntax:  ddm {-control_args}


Function:  Displays the model definition of a MRDS data base, including
domain, attribute, and relation information.


Control arguments:
-attribute {modifier}, -attr {modifier}
   displays attribute information.  The modifier may be name(s) or
   -unreferenced (-unref).  If name(s) is supplied, information for the
   attribute name(s) is displayed.  If -unreferenced is supplied,
   attribute information about all unreferenced attributes is
   displayed.  If no modifier is supplied, attribute information about
   all attributes is displayed.
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the brief format be displayed.  This argument is
   incompatible with -names.


-cmdb
   specifies that the output be in the same format as an input source
   text for create_mrds_db.  If the -output_file control argument is
   included in the invocation, then the segment can be used to create
   another data base with the same definitions.  Only the -brief,
   -long, and -output_file control arguments can be used with this
   control argument.


-crossref {type}, -xref {type}
   displays an information cross-reference.  The type may be domain
   (dom), attribute (attr), or all.  If the type is domain, each domain
   is listed with a list of attributes in which the domain is
   referenced.  If the type is attribute, each attribute is listed with
   a list of relations in which the attribute is referenced.  If the
   type is all, both domain and attribute cross-references are
   displayed.  (Default is "all".)  See the examples below which show
   the information displayed.


-domain {modifier}, -dom {modifier}
   displays domain information.  The modifier may be name(s) or
   -unreferenced (-unref).  If name(s) is supplied, information for the
   domain name(s) is displayed.  If -unreferenced is supplied, domain
   information about all unreferenced domains is displayed.  If no
   modifier is supplied, domain information about all domains is
   displayed.
-header, -he
   displays data base header information.
-history, -hist
   displays restructuring history information.  If the data base is
   restructured more then once, the history entries are displayed in
   reverse chronological order.


-index names, -ix names
   displays information about indexed relations for the relation names
   supplied.  If no names are supplied, then information about all
   indexed relations is displayed.
-long, -lg
   specifies that the long format be displayed.  This argument is
   incompatible with -names.
-names, -nm
   displays the format of domains, attributes, relations, and indexed
   relations as a list of the names.  This argument is incompatible
   with -brief or -long.
-no_header, -nhe
   prevents display of the header information.  (Default)
-no_output_file, -nof
   writes the output to the terminal.  (Default)


-output_file path, -of path
   writes the output to path, rather than to the terminal.
-relation names, -rel names
   displays relation information for the relation names supplied.  If
   no names are supplied, the relation information about all relations
   is displayed.
-temp_dir path
   specifies that the directory indicated by path be used for temporary
   storage.


Notes:  If no control arguments are supplied, the default relation
information is displayed.


Examples:
If the data base "little" is created from the source:

     domain:  code fixed bin, address char(20);
     relation:  zip(code* address);

 the results would be as follows:
