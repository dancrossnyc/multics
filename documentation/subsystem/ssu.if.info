01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  if

Syntax:  if EXPR -then LINE1 {-else LINE2}


Syntax as an active request:  if EXPR -then STR1 {-else STR2}


Function:  conditionally executes one of two request lines depending on
the value of an active string.  As an active request, returns one of
two character strings to the subsystem request processor depending on
the value of an active string.


Arguments:
EXPR
   is the active string which must evaluate to either "true" or
   "false".  The active string is constructed from subsystem active
   requests and Multics active strings (using the subsystem's execute
   active request).
LINE1
   is the subsystem request line to execute if EXPR evaluates to
   "true".  If the request line contains any request processor
   characters, it must be enclosed in quotes.
STR1
   is returned as the value of the if active request if the EXPR
   evaluates to "true".


LINE2
   is the subsystem request line to execute if EXPR evaluates to
   "false".  If omitted and EXPR is "false", no additional request line
   is executed.  If the request line contains any request processor
   characters, it must be enclosed in quotes.
STR2
   is returned as the value of the if active request if the EXPR
   evaluates to "false".  If omitted and the EXPR is "false", a null
   string is returned.
