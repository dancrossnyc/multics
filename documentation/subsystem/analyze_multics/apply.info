Syntax:  apply VIRTUAL-ADDR {RANGE} command_line

Function: Extracts all or part of a segment, specified by VIRTUAL-ADDR
from the selected FDUMP and places a copy in a temporary segment.  The
new path name is passed as the last argument in the command_line.


Argument:
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   May be a segment number, name or symbolic address (e.g.  64, prds,
   prds$am_data).  Do a 'help virtual_address' for more detailed
   information on acceptable virtual-address constructs.
RANGE
   Specifies the number of words in octal to be copied.  The default is
   the entire segment.
command_line
   any command.


Notes: The offset in the virtual address specifies where the copying of
the segment begins.  When only part of a segment is extracted, it goes
at the beginning of the temporary segment.  For example:

         apply pds$am_data 400 dump_segment

will put 256 (decimal) words at the beginning of the segment.
