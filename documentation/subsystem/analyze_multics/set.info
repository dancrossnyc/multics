Syntax:  set PTR_N VIRTUAL-ADDR


Function: set a internal temporary pointer much like a cpu pointer
register (i.e.  "pr6" or "sp").  These pointers can then be used as a
VIRTUAL-ADDR by other analyze_multics commands.


Argument:
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   may be a segment number, name or symbolic address (e.g.  64, prds,
   prds$am_data).  Do a 'help virtual_address' for more detailed
   information on acceptable virtual-address constructs.
PTR_N
   can be either the name or number of a 'temporary pointer'.  There
   are 8 temporary pointers and 2 special case pointers.
        number	 name 	number	 name
           pr0         ap	   pr4	   lp	
	 pr1	   ab	   pr5	   lb
	 pr2	   bp	   pr6	   sp
	 pr3	   bb	   pr7	   sb
          prmc      intended to be a pointer to the current MCs.
	prfr	intended to be a pointer to the current stack frame.


Examples:
      set pr6 240|100   this would set a temporary ptr named pr6 (sp).
      set sb 240	        this would set the temporary ptr (sb) to the
		        base of seg 240 (240|0).


Notes:
     The value of a temporary pointer can be displayed via the value
     request: value  {ptrn | -all}
