Syntax:  analyze_multics {-control_args}

Function: Invoke a subsystem that will permit the scanning of a Multics
address space for analysis.


Control arguments:
-abbrev, -ab
   enables abbreviation expansion of request lines.
-no_abbrev, -nab
   does not enable abbreviation expansion of request lines. (Default)
-no_prompt
   suppresses the prompt for request lines in the request loop.
-no_start_up, -nsu
   specifies that no startup exec_com is to be executed.  (Default)
-profile PATH, -pf PATH
   specifies the pathname of the profile to use for abbreviation
   expansion.  The suffix "profile" is added if necessary.  This
   control argument implies -abbrev.
-prompt STR
   sets the request loop prompt to STR.  The default is the ioa_ STR:
                   ^/azm^[ (^d)^]:^2x
-request STR, -rq STR
   executes STR as a analyze_multics request line before entering the
   request loop.
-start_up, -su
   specifies that the exec_com 'start_up.azmec' is to be executed upon
   invocation of analyze_multics.  This start_up exec_com is first
   searched for in the user's home directory, then in the user's
   project directory >udd>Project_id, and last in >site.  The first
   exec_com found is used.
-quit
   Exit analyze_mulitcs after execution of other arguments.  Can be
   used in conjunction with -request.


Notes: analyze_multics uses the standard search list mechanism to
locate FDUMPs.  If analyze_multics does not find a "dumps" search list,
it will create one, placing >dumps in the search list as the default.
If additional search paths are desired the "add_search_path" command
should be used to define them.
