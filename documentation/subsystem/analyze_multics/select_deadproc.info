10/03/84  select_deadproc, sldp

Syntax:  sldp {NAME}

Function:  Selects and translates a  dead process.  Found via the
dumps search list. The default path in which deadprocs are found is
>dumps>save_pdirs. 


Arguments:
NAME
   Is the name of the process directory of interest.  This can be a
   relative or absolute pathname.  The dead process directory name is
   of the form person.pdir or person.N.pdir, where N is a numeric
   number, N=1 for the most recently copied dead process.  The suffix
   "pdir" is assumed if not given.


Notes: When sldp is invoked with no arguments, it prints an identifying
message.  This is identical to how the select_dump request works.
