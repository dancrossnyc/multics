Syntax:  search VIRTUAL-ADDR {range} SEARCH_STRING
        [search VIRTUAL-ADDR {range} SEARCH_STRING]          


Function: This command will search a segment starting at VIRTUAL-ADDR
matching on SEARCH_STRING.  The search is performed on a 36 bit word
boundary.  As an active request, the virtual addresses matching the
criteria specified is returned.


Argument:
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   is the pointer to the address space to search.  See
   virtual_address.info
range
   specifies the number of words to be searched from the starting
   offset, where range is an octal value.  The default is the rest of
   segment.  The search is started from VIRTUAL-ADDR.
SEARCH_STRING
   This is a 12 character string representing the 12 octal digits that
   make up a machine word (36 bit,3 bits per digit).  This will be used
   to form both the search data and search mask, by using the hyphen
   (-) as a "don't care character" in the string.  The "do care digits"
   are octal "0 -> 7".  Any other character is illegal.


Examples: To search for:
    1) all words in segment 76 that have the last two digits of 43:

                 search 76 ----------43                             

    2) all words in tc_data where the upper half = 070707    

                 search tc_data 070707------                        

    3) words that  end in 1234  in sst_seg starting  at 1000 but only
       searching for 200 octal words                

                 search sst_seg|1000 200 --------1234               


      4) words that start with 45 and end with 77 starting a sst_seg$ptl
         for 100 words

                search sst_seg$ptl 100 45--------77
