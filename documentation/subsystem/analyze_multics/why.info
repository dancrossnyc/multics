08/15/83  why

Syntax:  why


Function: The why request will try to find the stack that has a call to
syserr_real$syserr_real or call_bce$call_bce and set the temporary
pointers, pr6 and prfr, to the stack frame.  This command will search
the stacks for a frame that has a return_to_ring_0_ frame and set the
temporary pointers from this set of machine conditions that called this
entry.
    

Notes: If the crash was due to fim_util$check_fault finding a problem, the
machine condition CU data is displayed and all temporary pointers are
set from these machine conditions.  If this was an Execute Fault then
some lock info is printed an the process selected is lock ordered.
First sst_seg$ptl followed by sst_seg$aslt then scs$connect_lock next
tty_buf$slock and last tty_buf$timer_lock.
     						
If this fdump was due to a manual return to BOS then some pertinent lock
info will also be printed.
