12/12/82 Virtual Address Constructs

Accessing data requires some pointer value to define an address space.
The generation of the pointer value is performed by resolving a virtual
address (VIRTUAL-ADDR).  A VIRTUAL-ADDR consist of two parts, a segment
number and a word offset.

Analyze_multics (azm) will resolve VIRTUAL-ADDR'S from the following
types of information:


Symbols:    
   is a symbolic name for a segment number and an offset (i.e., sst$ptl
   can be resolved to the correct segment number and offset of the page
   table lock).


Segment name: 
   a segment name can be resolved in many ways, but it can only provide
   one part of the virtual address; azm uses 0 as the default offset
   for this pointer value (i.e., tc_data is resolved to SEGNO|0).


Segment number:
   a segment number needs no resolution, but a default action needs to
   be taken for the offset (the default is 0, i.e., SEGNO|0).


Segment name/number and offset:
   The VIRTUAL-ADDR in this case can be a segment name or segment
   number and an octal offset (i.e., the construct of pds|20 is
   translated to SEGNO|20 or dseg|5 is 0|5).  The notation "|" and "$"
   must be used without spaces (e.g., 244|0 or sst$cmp).


Temporary pointers:
   azm keeps a set of 11 temporary pointers per translation.  A
   translation is one complete entity such as an "FDUMP".  These
   pointers can be set with the set request (e.g., set sp 230|100).
   They can be referenced by other requests as another type of "symbol"
   in a VIRTUAL-ADDR expression, after they have been set.  If not set,
   these pointers are null.


Offset Operators:
   The operators "+N" and "-N" immediately preceding an octal number,
   or VIRTUAL-ADDR construct can be used to alter the offset of a
   virtual address.  N is a number interpreted in octal.  No spaces are
   allowed between the operator and the N.  For example, sst$ptl +30
   are resolved to be the SEGNO for sst_seg with the offset of ptl plus
   30 octal locations; sst$ptl+30 is also valid.


Indirection:
   A VIRTUAL-ADDR can imply indirection.  The indirect word can be used
   as an ITS pair if it is a valid ITS word pair; if not, the upper
   half of the word is used.  The following VIRTUAL-ADDR construct is
   used to specify indirection (sst$cmp,*).  The format of an indirect
   pointer value is:
   
       segno|offset,*       segname|offset,*       symbol,*
       temp_ptr,*	        temp_ptr|offset,*


Examples of indirection:
       17|230,*             sst|230,*              sst$cmp,*+2
       sp,*	        sp|230,*
