10/24/84  select_dump, sld                                              

Syntax:  sld {NAME} {-control_args}                           

Function: Selects and translates an FDUMP of a system crash.  Found
via the dump search list which defaults to >dumps.


Argument:
NAME                                                         
   is the ERF number or the path name of the zero (0) component of
   the FDUMP.  It can also be the form path>35 where 35 is the erf
   number.  Several control_args are also acceptable if NAME is not
   specified.


Control arguments:                                           
-first, -ft                                                  
   selects the first dump (by erf number) in the dump directory found
   via the dump search list.
-last, -lt                                                   
   selects the last (most current) dump in the dump directory
   according to erf number.
-next, -nx                                                   
   selects the next dump in the dump directory.  This is relative to
   the dump currently being looked at.
-previous, -prev                                              
   selects the previous dump in the dump directory.  This is relative
   to the dump currently being looked at.


NOTE:
     The sld command will attempt to select the process as
     indicated by scs$trouble_processid.  If this cannot be done
     the the default will be the first running process found in
     the dump.
