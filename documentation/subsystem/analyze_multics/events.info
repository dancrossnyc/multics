01/23/85  events, ev


Syntax: events {-control_args}


Function: Displays 'interesting events', in reverse chronological
order, from an FDUMP.  Those events considered to be interesting are
described in 'notes'.


Control arguments:
-exclude STRING, -ex STRING
   does not print lines containing STRING.  Exclusion is done after
   matching.  Thus, "-match A -exclude B" prints all lines with an A
   except those with a B.
-exclude /REGEXP/, -ex /REGEXP/
   does not print lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.  (See the qedx command for the definition of
   regular expressions.)
-last {N}, -lt {N}
   specifies the number of events to print. If no N, the default is
   10 events.
-long, -lg
   specifies that disk queue events are to be displayed.


-match STRING, -mh STRING
   prints only lines containing the character string STRING.
-match /REGEXP/, -mh /REGEXP/
   prints only lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.
-time {NSECS}, -tm {NSECS}
   specifies the time in seconds before the dump was taken when events
   were 'interesting'.  Default is 10 seconds.


Notes: The following events are considered as interesting: Machine
Conditions (from BCE, prds, pds and the mc_trace_buf), Traffic Control
state change time, Syserr messages (from both syserr_data and
syserr_log), Fim frames in any stack, connects by device and disk
queues (long report ONLY).

If neither -time nor -last are specified, the default action is
equivalent to "ev -time 10".
