Syntax:  sdw {segno/name} {segno/name}


Function:  Displays the SDW's in the current processes DSEG.


Argument:
segno/name
   is the segment number or name of interest.  The first is the
   starting segment number and the second is the ending segment
   number.  If only one is given then only one is displayed if none
   are given then all are displayed.


SDW Display:
The sdw request displays the segment number, name, memory address,
ring brackets, the maximum computed address, the entry bound address
and a bit string REWPUGCDF.


Display definitions:
ADDRESS
   is the base address of the segment or segment page table.
RNGS
   the ring brackets of the segment.
CA-MAX
   the highest computed address that may be used in referencing the
   segment without causing an out_of_segment_bounds fault. 
EBOUND
   is the entry bound or call limiter. Any external call to this
   segment must be to an offset less than the EBOUND if the entry
   bound switch (G) is off.
SEGNO
   segment number.
SEGMENT-NAME
   segment name.


Display definition of REWPUGCDF:
REWPUGCDF
   The letter will show in the sdw display of the segment if the bit
   is on.  The REWPUGCDF string is broken down as follows: 
     R is the read permission bit
     E is the execute permission bit
     W is the write permission bit
     P is the privileged bit
     U is the unpaged bit, segment is unpaged is this is on
     G is the gate indicator or entry bound bit. If off, the entry 
       bound is checked by hardware
     C is the cache enable switch.
     DF is the directed fault bit. If on, the necessary page of the
        segment is in memory.
