Syntax: lsp {proc_indicator} {-control_argument}
        [lsp {proc_indicator} {-control_argument}]

Function:  Lists  all known processes in  the selected FDUMP.


Function as Active Request:
Returns  the  process_ids meeting the control argument criteria,
returning a null string otherwise. If -count is specified, only the
total is returned.

Argument:
proc_indicator                                                
   for specifying  individual processes.  It  can take one of three
   forms:
   - The decimal index (starting at zero) of a process in the FDUMP.
   - The octal apte offset of the process.
   - The octal process_id of the process.               


Control Arguments:
-all, -a                                                
   Lists all processes in the FDUMP (Default).
-blocked, -blk
   Lists processes marked as blocked.
-count, -ct                                           
   specified by the control_args.  With -all, it gives the
   counts of each process state including the overall total.
-current, -cur
    Lists the current process.
-page_tbl_lock, -ptl
    Lists processes marked as page table locking.
-ready, -rdy
    Lists processes marked as ready.
-run
   Lists processes marked as running.
-stopped, -stop
   Lists processes marked as stopped.
-wait
   Lists processes marked as waiting.              


Example: !  do "select_process &1;sdw 0" ([list_processes]) 
Would display the SDW for DSEG for all processes in the FDUMP.
