08/10/83      stack, sk                      

Syntax:  sk VIRTUAL-ADDR {-control_arguments}     

Function:  Traces a given stack.


Argument:
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   is any segment and offset value that is acceptable to the dump
   command.  See virtual_address.info


Control arguments:
-arguments, -ag
   prints the arguments for the stack frames traced.
-for N
   will trace for N stack frames.  If no valid stack
   frames exist (stack_begin_ptr = stack_end_ptr), a -fc must be used.
-force, -fc
   will force a forward stack trace.  To be used when there are no
   valid frames for this stack (stack_begin_ptr = stack_end_ptr).
-forward, -fwd
   will trace in a forward manner.
-long, -lg
   will cause the arguments and an octal dump of the
   stack frames traced.


Notes: The default is to trace the stack in reverse order unless -fc or
-fwd are specified.  If the VIRTUAL-ADDR has a zero offset then the
trace starts at the offset of the first stack
(stack_header.stack_begin_ptr).  If the VIRTUAL-ADDR has a non-zero
offset then the trace is started from that offset in the given stack.
