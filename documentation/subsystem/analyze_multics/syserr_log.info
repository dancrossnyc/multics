01/21/85   syserr_log, slog

Syntax:  syserr_log {-control_args}


Function: Displays all or parts of the syserr_log and syserr_data
segments from the dump.  It does not examine the perm_syserr_log.  The
default is to print the entire log and all actions.


Control arguments:
-action A
   displays messages starting at severity -100 and up to the action
   code specified by A, where A is a decimal integer between -100 and
   100.  A range can also be specified, consisting of a pair decimal
   integers separated by a colon ("20:29").
-exclude STR -ex STR
   where STR is a string that is matched against the log, as for
   -match.  Any message that contains STR is not printed.


-last N, -lt N
   where N is a decimal integer.  This argument specifies that the scan
   is to start N messages back from the end of the log.
-match STR
   where STR is a string to be matched against messages in the log.
   Any message that contains STR is a candidate to be printed.
-expand, -exp
   specifies that messages that have binary data will have that binary
   data interpreted.  The format is generally dependent on the text of
   the message.
