08/09/83     configuration_deck, cd

Syntax:  cd {card_names} {control_args}

Function: displays the contents of the config_deck in the selected
FDUMP.  This request works exactly like the standard pcd command, the
only difference is that it gets the config deck from the FDUMP.


Argument:
card_names
   are the names of the particular configuration cards to be displayed.
   Up to 32 card names can be specified.  If no card_names are given
   the the complete config_deck will be printed.


Control Arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the error message when a requested card name is not
   found.  (Default)
-exclude FIELD_SPECIFIERS, -ex FIELD_SPECIFIERS
   excludes particular cards or card types from being displayed.  One
   to 14 field specifiers can be supplied with each -exclude control
   argument, and up to 16 -exclude arguments can be specified.  To be
   eligible for exclusion, a card must contain fields that match all
   field specifiers supplied with any -exclude argument.
-long, -lg
   prints an error message when a requested card name is not found.
-match FIELD_SPECIFIERS
   selects particular cards or card types to be displayed.  One to 14
   field specifiers can be supplied with each -match control argument,
   and up to 16 -match arguments can be specified.  To be eligible for
   selection, a card must contain fields that match all field
   specifiers supplied with any -match argument.


Notes: Field specifiers can consist of a complete card field or a
partial field and an asterisk (*).  An asterisk matches any part of any
field.  Specifiers for numeric fields can be given in octal or decimal,
but if decimal they must contain a decimal point.  Asterisks cannot be
specified in numeric field specifiers.  All numeric field specifiers
are converted to decimal and matched against numeric card fields, which
are also converted to decimal.  Hence, the field specifier "1024."
would match a card containing the octal field 2000, and the field
specifier "1000" would match a card containing the decimal field 512.

Note that all card names must be specified before the first -match or
-exclude argument.  Field specifiers following a -match or -exclude
argument include all arguments until the next -match or -exclude
argument.
