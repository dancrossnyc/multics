08/05/83 history_regs, hregs

Syntax:  hregs {HREGS_specifier} {-control_args}


Function: Displays a composite analysis or octal dump of the processor
history registers.  This request, hregs, is useful by people who are
knowledgable of the hardware.  The default action is to display the AU,
CU and OU history registers for the pds in a threaded order and
interpreted format.


Argument (HREGS Specifiers):                                            
-condition VIRTUAL-ADDR, -cond VIRTUAL-ADDR                   
   displays history registers from a condition frame, the location of
   which is described by VIRTUAL-ADDR.
-dump                                                         
   displays the "dump" history registers from the BOS CPU at the time
   the dump was taken.
-pds                                                          
   displays the history registers that have been stored in the current
   processes pds (Default).
VIRTUAL-ADDR
   displays the history registers that have been stored at the address
   space specified by VIRTUAL-ADDR.  See virtual_address.info.


Control Arguments:
-au
   specifies that only the APU history registers are to be displayed.
-cu
   specifies that only the CU history registers are to be displayed.
-du
   specifies that only the DU history registers are to be displayed.
-interpret                                                    
   Display the interpreted form of the history registers only
   (Default), or, if -octal is specified, include the octal
   representation also.
-octal, -oc                                                   
   Displays the octal values of history registers only, or, if
   -interpret is also specified, display octal and interpreted form.
   If neither -octal nor -interpret is specified, the default action is
   to display the interpreted form only.
-thread                                                       
   Attempt to display the selected history registers in the "correct"
   order (Default).
-no_thread
   Display the selected history registers in serial order, without
   attempting to sort them.
-ou
   specifies that only the OU history registers are to be displayed.


Notes: Use of the -au, -ou, -cu and -du control arguments imply
   -no_thread and the display will not be in a threaded order.
