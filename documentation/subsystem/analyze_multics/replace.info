07/26/83  replace, rp

Syntax:  replace segno/segname PATH

Function: Replaces the segment designated by segno/segname in the
current translation table, with another segment designated by PATH.


Argument:
PATH
   is the path name of the segment.  The equal convention can be 
   used: replace bound_system_faults [e wd]>=.new

segno/segname
   the segment number or segment name within the translation table to
    be replaced.


Notes: Both per-process and per-system segments can be replaced.  For
example, if the pds is replaced in a process, it affects only the
current process, whereas if tc_data is replaced in a process, it
affects the whole FDUMP.
