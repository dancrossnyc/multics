01/24/82  Standard subsystem request:  list_requests, lr

Syntax:  lr {STRs} {-control_args}


Function:  prints a brief description of selected subsystem requests.


Arguments:
STRs
   specifies the requests to be listed.  Any request with a name
   containing one of these strings is listed unless -exact is used in
   which case the request name must exactly match one of these strings.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   includes undocumented and unimplemented requests in the list of
   requests eligible for matching the STR arguments.
-exact
   lists only those requests one of whose names exactly match one of
   the STR arguments.


Notes:
If no STRs are given, all requests are listed.

When matching STRs with request names, a request name is considered
to match a STR only if that STR is at the beginning or end of a word
within the request name.  Words in request names are bounded by the
beginning and end of the request name and by the characters period (.),
hyphen (-), underscore (_), and dollar sign ($).


Examples:
The request line:
   list_requests list
will match requests named list, list_users, and forum_list but will not
match a request named prelisting.
