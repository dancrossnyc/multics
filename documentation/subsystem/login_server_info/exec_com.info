Syntax:  ec ec_path {ec_args}


Syntax as an active request:  [ec ec_path {ec_args}]


Function:  executes a program written in the exec_com language which is
used to pass request lines to the subsystem and to pass input lines to
requests which read input.  As an active request, the exec_com program
specifies a return value of the exec_com request by use of the &return
statement.


Arguments:
ec_path
   is the pathname of an exec_com program.  The lsec suffix is assumed
   if not specified.  If only an entryname is given, ssu_ looks for the
   exec_com in the directories given in the exec_com search list.
ec_args
   are optional arguments to the exec_com program and are substituted
   for parameter references in the program such as &1.


Notes:
Subsystems may define a search list to be used to find the exec_com
program.  If this is the case, the search list is used if ec_path does
not contain a "<" or ">" character; if the ec_path does contain either
a "<" or ">", it is assumed to be a relative pathname.


When evaluating a subsystem exec_com program, subsystem active
requests are used rather than Multics active functions when evaluating
the &[...] construct and the active string in an &if statement.  The
subsystem's execute active request may be used to evaluate Multics
active strings within the exec_com.


Limitation;
In the present implementation, any errors detected during execution of
an exec_com within a subsystem will abort the request line in which the
exec_com request was invoked.
