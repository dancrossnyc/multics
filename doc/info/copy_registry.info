01/24/84  copy_registry

Syntax:  copy_registry from_path {to_path} {-control_arg}


Function:  is used by the system administrator to make checkpoint
copies of RCP Resource Management registries.  These copies can be used
as a basis for the reconstruction of registries destroyed by
catastrophic system failure.


Arguments:
from_path
   is the pathname of the registry to be copied.  The star convention
   is accepted.  If the suffix rcpr is not given, it is assumed.
to_path
   is the pathname of the copy to be created.  The equals convention is
   accepted.  If the suffix rcpr is not given, it is assumed.  If
   to_path is not supplied, the copy will be placed in the working
   directory and will have the same name as the original.  (See "Notes"
   below.)


Control arguments:
-reset
   specifies that the contents of the registry journal are to be
   discarded after the copy operation has been successfully completed.
   (See "Notes" below.)


Notes:  It is strongly recommended that the RCP Administrator NOT copy
registries into >sc1>rcp (for reconstruction purposes or otherwise)
except under special session.

The registry journal contains a record of all operations performed
against all registries since the time its contents were last reset via
the use of the -reset control argument described above.  Since a
successful reconstruction operation depends on the journal containing a
record of all operations performed since the copies of the registries
were created, it is important that the -reset control argument only be
specified for invocations which result in the copying of all
registries.


The copying of any number of registries and the resetting
of the journal within one invocation of the copy_registry command is
performed as an indivisible operation, which guarantees that no
operations can be performed against any of the registries involved
until the copying operation is complete and the journal has been reset.
Since this cannot be guaranteed between multiple invocations of the
copy_registry command, the -reset control argument should never be used
without copying all active registries.

When -reset is specified, the journal is reset only if the copy
operations are completed successfully.

Copies of system registries are automatically made each night by the
system accounting facility (crank) using this command.


Access required:  This command requires access to the rcp_admin_
gate.
