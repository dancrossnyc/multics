Section 5:  Add the following control argument documentation to

     store_from_data_file (pg 5-68), write (pg 5-71), and
     write_data_file (pg 5-72) requests.

        specifies that progress messages should not be printed.
        (DEFAULT)
     -progress, -pg
        specifies that a progress message should be printed after
        N tuples have been processed, where N is any positive
        integer.  If N is not specified the default is to print a
        progress message after 1000 tuples.


Section 5:  Add the following control argument documentation to
     the command write-ups for the store (pg 5-66) and
     store_from_data_file (pg 5-68) requests.

     -no_warning, -no_warn
        specifies that warning messages should not be printed
        when storing the tuple results in a conversion error or
        duplicate tuple error.
     -warning, -warn
        specifies that warning messages are printed when storing
        the tuple results in a conversion error or duplicate
        tuple error.  (DEFAULT)


Section 5:  Under the notes section for the store (pg 5-66) and
     (pg 5-68) store_from_data_file requests add the following.

     Warning messages are printed when attempting to store a new
     row into the table causes a conversion error or a duplicate
     tuple error.  When these warning messages are printed, the
     tuple is not stored.  Any other errors besides these
     previously mentioned two result in the termination of the
     request.
