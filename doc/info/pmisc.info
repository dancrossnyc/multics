02/08/84  pmisc

Syntax:  pmisc


Function: allows the accounting administrator to print the contents of
the miscfile.  It is useful as a check to be sure that all entries in
the miscfile are correct before the bills are run.  The accounting
administrator can print the miscellaneous charges and credits for an
individual project or he can print the entire miscfile.  He can also
print the charges and credits for specific dates.  The dates must be
in the form mm/dd/yy or mm/dd.  If more than one date appears on the
same line, they must be separated by spaces.  Type "x" instead of a
Project_id to exit from the command.


Notes:  The pmisc command first asks the accounting administrator to
enter the name of the project whose miscfile entries he wants to
review.  If the accounting administrator types "all" in response to
this request, the entries for all projects in the miscfile are printed.

The pmisc command then asks the accounting administrator to enter the
dates on which the charges to be reviewed were incurred.  If the
accounting administrator types "all" in response to this request, all
the entries in the miscfile are printed.
