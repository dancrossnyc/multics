03/31/83  strip_entry, spe

Syntax:  spe path {STR}


Syntax as active function:  [spe path {STR}]


Function:  returns the entryname portion of the specified pathname with
the last component name removed, if the entryname portion has more than
one component.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname from which the trailing name component is removed.
STR
   is the character string to be stripped.  If STR is not specified,
   the last component of the entryname portion of path is removed.  If
   STR is specified, the last components are removed only if they match
   STR and STR does not equal path.


Notes:  Since the pathname is returned in quotes, the command processor
treats it as a single argument regardless of special characters in the
name.
