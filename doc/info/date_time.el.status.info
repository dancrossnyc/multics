memo doesn't know and can't ever know that a repeat of 2weeks
represents either 335 hours, 336 hours, or 337 hours, depending on the
happening of a standard/daylight zone change during that period.

decimal_date_time_ and request_id_ typically differ by sereral hours in
the strings they return.

This is true, request_id_ is always in GMT while decimal_date_time_ is
in the default zone.  There is no documentation on either of these, so
there is no way to tell if they both are fulfilling their contract.
   This will soon be a moot point, since the 5-6 users of
decimal_date_time_ will be changed to do something else and then
decimal_date_time_ will go away.
