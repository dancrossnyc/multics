01/31/84  display_fnp_idle

Syntax:  display_fnp_idle {fnp_names} {-control-args}


Function:  displays information on FNP idle time stored by
the meter_fnp_idle command.  The display can be in the form of a
summary or a line graph (histogram).


Arguments:
fnp_names
   are the names of the FNPs for which idle time information is to be
   displayed.  If fnp_names is not specified, the display covers all
   FNPs for which information has been stored.


Control arguments:
-directory path, -dr path
   specifies that information is to be taken from segments in the
   directory with pathname path (see the meter_fnp_idle command
   description for idle time segment specifications).  The default is
   to display information from idle time segments in the working
   directory.
-from DT, -fm DT
   specifies that the display is to cover a period beginning no earlier
   than the date/time DT, which must be in a form suitable for input to
   the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  The default is to start the
   display from the most recent idle time segment.


-histogram, -hist
   causes output in the form of a histogram, where a line shows the
   busy percentage for each FNP at a given time interval.  The
   -histogram and -summary control arguments are mutually exclusive,
   but one or the other must be specified.
-interval N
   specifies that each line in the histogram represents an N minute
   interval.  This control argument is ignored if -summary is
   specified.  The default is 15 minute intervals.
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length of the histogram as N columns (N cannot be
   less than 38).  This control argument is ignored if -summary is
   specified.  The default is the user's terminal line length (or 80 if
   output is directed to a file).


-summary, -sum
   requests a summary display of FNP idle information for the specified
   time period.  The -summary and -histogram control arguments are
   mutually exclusive, but one or the other must be specified.
-to DT
   specifies that the display is to cover a period ending no later than
   the date/time DT, which must be in a form suitable for input to the
   convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  The default is to end the
   display with the latest available information.
