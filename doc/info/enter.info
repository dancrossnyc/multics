Syntax:  e {anonymous_name} Project_id {-control_args}
    or:  ep {anonymous_name} Project_id {-control_args}


Function: used by anonymous users to gain access to Multics.  Either
one is actually a request to the answering service to create a process
for the anonymous user.  Anonymous users who are not to supply a
password use the enter (e) request.  Anonymous users who are to supply
a password use the enterp (ep) request.  (See "Notes on passwords"
below.)


Control arguments:
-arguments STR, -ag STR
   supplies arguments to the process.  STR can be one or more
   arguments.  All arguments following -ag on the command line are
   taken as arguments to the process.  Therefore -ag, if present, must
   be the last control argument to the enter request.  The process can
   determine the number and value of each argument with the login_args
   active function.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages associated with a successful login.  If the
   standard process overseer is being used, the message of the day is
   not printed.


-force
   logs the user in if at all possible, provided the user has the
   guaranteed login attribute.  Only system users who perform emergency
   repair functions have the necessary attribute.
-home_dir path, -hd path
   sets the user's home directory to the path specified, if the user's
   project administrator allows that user specify a home directory.
-modes STR, -mode STR, -md STR
   sets the I/O modes associated with the user's terminal to STR, where
   the string STR consists of modes acceptable to the tty_ I/O module.
   (See the tty_ I/O module description in the Subroutines manual for a
   complete explanation of possible modes.)  The STR string is usually
   a list of modes separated by commas; the STR string must not contain
   blanks.


-no_preempt, -np
   refuses to log the user in if login can be achieved only by
   preempting some other user in the load control group.
-no_print_off, -npf
   causes the system to overtype a string of characters to provide a
   black area for typing the password.
-no_start_up, -ns
   instructs the standard process overseer not to execute the user's
   start_up.ec segment, if one exists, and if the project administrator
   allows the user to avoid it.


-no_warning, -nw
   suppresses even urgent system warning and emergency messages from
   the operator, both at login and during the user's session.  Use of
   this argument is recommended only for users who are using a remote
   computer to simulate a terminal, or are typing out long memoranda,
   when the process output should not be interrupted by even the most
   serious messages.
-outer_module p, -om p
   attaches the user's terminal via the outer module named p rather
   than the user's registered outer module, if the user has the
   privilege of specifying an outer module.
-print_off, -pf
   suppresses overtyping for the password.  (Default: determined by the
   terminal type)


-process_overseer path, -po path
   sets the user's process overseer to the procedure given by the path
   specified, if the user's project administrator allows that user to
   specify a process overseer.  If path ends in the characters
   ",direct", the specified procedure is called directly during process
   initialization rather than by the init_admin procedure provided by
   the system.  This means that the program specified by path must
   perform the tasks that would have been performed by the init_admin
   procedure.
-ring N, -rg N
   sets the user's initial ring to be ring N, if this ring number is
   greater than or equal to the user's registered initial ring and less
   than the user's registered maximum ring.


-subsystem path, -ss path
   creates the user's process using the prelinked subsystem in the
   directory specified by path.  The permission to specify a process
   overseer, which can be given by the user's project administrator,
   also governs the use of the -subsystem argument.  To override a
   default subsystem by the project administrator, type -ss "".
-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   sets the user's terminal type to STR, where STR is any terminal type
   name defined in the standard terminal type table.  (To obtain a list
   of terminal types, refer to the print_terminal_types command.)  This
   control argument overrides the default terminal type.


Notes: If neither the -print_off nor -no_print_off control argument is
specified at log-in, the system attempts to choose the option most
appropriate for the user's terminal type.

If the project administrator does not allow the user to specify the
-subsystem, -outer_module, -home_dir, -process_overseer, or -ring
control arguments or if the administrator does allow one or more of
these control arguments and they are incorrectly specified by the user,
a message is printed and the login is refused.


Notes on passwords: The password is a string of one to eight
characters.  The characters can be any printing character from the
ASCII character set except space and semi-colon.  The backspace
character is also allowed and is counted as a character.  The password
used for interactive logins cannot be "quit", "help", "HELP", or "?",
because these have special meaning to the password processor.  Typing a
password of "quit" terminates the login attempt.  A response of "help",
"HELP", or "?"  produces an explanatory message, and the request for
the password is repeated.
