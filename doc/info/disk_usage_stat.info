report describing the number of segments, links, directories, and names
by hierarchy depth; distribution of segments by date of last reference
and last modification; distribution by segment size; distribution by
number of names; directory distribution by number of names; counts by
starname.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname that specifies the hierarchy inferior to path to be
   scanned.  The default is ">".


Notes:  The report is typed on the user's terminal.

The listing by starname is controlled by the contents of the segment

of starnames, one per line.  If the starname_list segment does not
exist, a single starname, **, which matches all entries, is assumed.
