04/09/84  detach_lv, dlv

Syntax as a command:  dlv volume_names


Function:  detaches one or more logical volumes that have been attached
for your process by the resource control package (RCP).


Arguments:
volume_names
   specifies the volumes to be detached.


Notes:  You can detach all logical volumes by specifying "all", rather
than any volume names.

The detaching involves telling the storage system that the logical
volume is no longer attached for this process; it does not affect the
attached/detached state of the logical volume for any other process.
