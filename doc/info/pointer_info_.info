:Entry:  pointer_info_:  02/17/2017  pointer_info_


Function:
This function returns information about a pointer value.


Syntax:
dcl pointer_info_ entry (ptr, fixed bin(35)) returns(char(76) var);
data = pointer_info_(pointer_value, code);


Arguments:
pointer_value
   is an aligned pointer value to be investigated.(Input)
code
   is a standard status code.(Output)  If nonzero, then an empty
   string is returned as the data.


:Entry:  location:  02/17/2017  pointer_info_$location


Function:
This function returns information about pointer storage (a pair of
words) at a specified location.  It checks for a pointer modifier
at the end of the first word. 


Syntax:
dcl pointer_info_$location entry (ptr, fixed bin(35))
       returns(char(76) var);
data = pointer_info_$location(pointer_loc, code);


Arguments:
pointer_loc
   is an aligned pointer to the storage location containing the
   pointer to be investigated.  This storage must begin on an even
   word boundary.  The pair of words at that location are
   investigated as a possible pointer value, having either an ITS
   (octal 43) or Fault Tag 2 (octal 46) modifier at the end of the
   first word in the pair.
code
   is a standard status code.(Output)  If nonzero, then an empty
   string is returned as the data.
