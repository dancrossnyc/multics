02/05/86  256K Segments

Until recently the maximum length of a Multics segment was 255K
(261120) words even though the computer hardware allows segments to be
as long as 256K (262144) words.  To support very large arrays in the
FORTRAN programming language the maximum segment length has been
increased to 256K words; however, most Multics software and user
programs are not designed to cope with such segments.

A per-process switch controls whether the process is allowed to use
segments with a maximum length of 256K words.  The default value for
this switch is set by your site, and typically it will be off.  You
can alter the switch.  See process_switch_on, process_switch_off, and
hcs_$set_256K_switch for more information.

To create a 256K-word segment, call the hcs_$set_max_length
subroutine; the set_max_length command does not support lengths above
255K words.
