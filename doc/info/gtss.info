08/02/84  gcos_tss, gtss

Syntax as a command:  gtss


Function:  The gcos_tss command invokes the GTSS to run a single GCOS
time sharing user in the user's process.


Notes:  All parameters controlling the operation of gcos_tss are set
with the gcos_set_environment command.  If gtss is invoked with no
prior call to gcos_set_environment, the following values are assumed:

-drm wd -modes ast,^drl,^gbd,^mcmd,^mquit,^ss

The gtss SAVE command will not set the bit counts on segments created
via this command, since they are not needed by the simulator.  If,
however, the user wishes to manipulate the files via programs external
to the simulator (such as gcos_card_utility), the bit counts must first
be set modulo 320 words.

The gtss command may not be invoked while the caller is using
window_call (video mode).  The GTSS subsystems cannot handle the
special I/O required to support this terminal interface.
