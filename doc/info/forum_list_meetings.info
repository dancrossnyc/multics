4/4/85  forum_list_meetings, flsm

Syntax as a command:  flsm {meeting_names} {-control_args}

Function:  prints a list of selected meetings on the user's terminal.
For each meeting selected, information about the names of the meeting
and per-user meeting attributes are listed.


Arguments:
meeting_names
   are optional meeting_names.  If any are supplied, information about
   only the specified meeting_names is printed.  The star convention is
   supported for meeting_names.  If no meeting_names are given,
   information for all meetings found in the forum search path is
   printed.

   prints the absolute pathname of a meeting.  The default lists the
   long and short meeting names only.
-adjourned, -adj
   selects information about meetings that have been adjourned.

   prints information about all meetings.  The default prints
   information about the meetings in which the user is eligible to
   participate only.

   selects meetings which have not changed since the specified time.
   DATE_TIME is any string acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_
   subroutine.

   and new transactions have been entered.

   to participate.  (Default)


-exclude meeting_names, -ex meeting_names
   excludes the meetings identified by meeting_names from the output
   list.  This control argument is designed to be used when a starname

   meetings from being selected.  The default (-include) is to select
   all meetings that match the specified starname.

   selects meetings which have changed since the specified time.  DT is
   any string acceptable to the convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.

   control argument was supplied.

   format and errors encountered while searching for meetings.
   (Default)

   prints information about all meetings that the user is eligible to
   participate in.
-read_only, -ro
   lists just the meetings to which the user has only read access.
