02/08/84  edit_proj

Syntax:  edit_proj Project_id {keyword {newvalue}}


Function: allows the accounting administrator to edit all project
data.  The command can be invoked in two ways; either all the data
items that are part of project registration can be printed one at a
time or a single data item can be changed.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project whose registration data items are
   to be edited.  If this is the only argument specified, edit_proj
   prints each data item one at a time and waits for a response from
   the accounting administrator before proceeding.  The accounting
   administrator may respond with a carriage return, which leaves the
   item unchanged, a new value, which replaces the printed value, or a
   stop to exit immediately from the edit_proj command without making
   any changes.


keyword
   is the particular data item to be changed.  See "List of keywords"
   below.
newvalue
   is the new value of the data item identified by the specified
   keyword.  This argument cannot be given unless the keyword argument
   is also given.  If newvalue is omitted, the edit_proj command asks
   for it.  In both cases, the old value is printed.
