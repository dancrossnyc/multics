pg 25-13 under "DETAILED BINARY  DATA FORMAT FOR FILE SYSTEM
     OBJECTS" in the description  of <branch_switches> delete the
     sentence "(Note  that the "audit"  switch has no  meaning in
     MR11)".

pg 25-17 under "SYSERR LOG  AUDIT SELECTIVITY"  change the
     reference from  "two levels" of audit  selectivity to "three
     levels," the third level being "file system object level."


pg 25-36 Add the following description:

                 FILE SYSTEM OBJECT AUDIT FLAGS
     A  file  system  object  audit  flag,  known  as  the "audit
     switch", is  associated with each entry in  the file system.
     The  setting of  this switch   can only  be modified  by the
     system security  administrator.  If this switch  is on, then
     all   accesses  of   the  segment,   either  successful   or
     unsuccessful,  are audited.   In the  case of  mailboxes and
     message   segments,   audit   messages   are   produced  for
     segment-level accesses (e.g.,  opening, deleting, reading or
     changing ACLs,  reading or changing attributes)  but not for
     message-level   accesses  (adding,  deleting,   reading,  or
     updating messages).

     HEADER" add:   dcl FS_OBJ_AUDIT_FLAG_MOD fixed bin  (18) uns
     init (37) static options (constant):

          file system entry.
