01/27/84  deregister_resource, drr

Syntax:  drr type STR1 ...  STRN


Function:  makes a particular resource unknown to the system.  The
deregistration process informs the system that the resource is no
longer available for use.


Arguments:
type
   is a resource type defined in the RTDT.
STRi
   is the unique identifying name of the particular resource being
   deregistered.  If STR looks like a control argument (i.e., if it is
   preceded by a hyphen), then it must be preceded by -name or -nm.


Notes:  To be deregistered, the resource must be in the free state.  A
resource owned by a user (or belonging to the system pool) must be
released (see release_resource.info) before it may be deregistered.

If multiple resource names are specified to the deregister_resource
command and an error occurs in the deregistration of any of these
resources, none of the resources are deregistered.


Access required:
     The use of this command requires execute access to the rcp_admin_
gate.
