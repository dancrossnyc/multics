:Entry: cv_float_double_: 02/01/83 cv_float_double_ 


Function: converts an ASCII representation of a floating point number
and returns a double precision floating point representation.  If an
illegal character is encountered, its index in the string is returned
and the number is set to 0.0e0.  (See also cv_float_.)


Syntax:
declare cv_float_double_ entry (char(*), fixed bin(35)) returns
     (float bin(63));
a = cv_float_double_ (string, code);


Arguments:
string
   is the string to be converted.  (Input)
code
   is the index in string of the first illegal character, if found;
   otherwise it is zero.
a
   is the result of the conversion.  (Output)


Notes:
Code is not a standard status code.  Therefore, it can not be passed to
com_err_ and other subroutines that accept only standard status codes.

This function can be performed more efficiently in PL/I by:
      on conversion,size goto badnumber;
      a = convert (a, string);
      revert conversion,size;
         .
         .
         .
      badnumber:
      call com_err_ (error_table_$bad_conversion, proc, string);
      return;
