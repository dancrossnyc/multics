Syntax as a command:  lds operation {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [lds operation {-control_args}]


Function:  This command/active function returns information about a
library descriptor data segment.


Arguments:
operation
   one of the operations listed below.


List of operations:
   For a more detailed description of an operation, type:
   	help lds.operation
name, nm
   print or return name of default library descriptor.
set
   set name of default library descriptor.
pathname, pn
   print or return pathnames of library roots.
default, dft
   print default library and search names used by library commands
   which use a descriptor.
root, rt
   print information about root directories or archives defined in a
   library descriptor.


Control arguments:  vary, depending upon the operation.


:Info: library_descriptor.name: lds.name: library_descriptor.nm: lds.nm:
02/10/86  library_descriptor name operation

Syntax as a command: lds nm


Syntax as an active function: [lds nm]


Function:  prints or returns the name of the default library
descriptor.


:Info: library_descriptor.set: lds.set:
02/10/86  library_descriptor set operation

Syntax as a command:   lds set desc_name


Function:  sets another descriptor as the default library descriptor.


Arguments:
desc_name
   pathname or reference name of new default library descriptor.


:Info: library_descriptor.pathname: lds.pathname: library_descriptor.pn: lds.pn:
02/10/86  library_descriptor pathname operation

Syntax as a command:  lds pn library_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function: [lds pn library_names {-control_args}]


Function:  prints or returns pathnames of library roots (directories or
archives).


Arguments:
library_names
   libraries whose pathnames to be returned.  The star convention is
   allowed.


Control arguments:
-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   returns library root paths from the given library descriptor.
   (default: return information from the default descriptor.)
-library library_name, -lb library_name
   specify library names which would otherwise look like control
   arguments.


:Info: library_descriptor.default: lds.default: library_descriptor.dft: lds.dft:
02/10/86  library_descriptor default operation

Syntax as a command:  lds dft {command_names} {-control_arg}


Function: prints default library names and search names defined for
library commands in a given library descriptor.


Arguments:
command_names
   selects commands whose default values are printed.   See "List of
   command names" below.  Defaults for all commands are listed by
   default.


Control arguments:
-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   prints command defaults from the given library descriptor.
   (default: print from the default library descriptor)


List of command names:
library_cleanup, lcln
library_fetch, lf
library_info, li,
library_pathname, lpn
library_map
library_print, lpr


:Info: library_descriptor.root: lds.root: library_descriptor.rt: lds.rt:
02/10/86  library_descriptor root operation


Syntax as a command:  lds rt {library_names} {-control_args}


Function: prints information about the roots (directories or archives)
of a library.  Information printed includes library names, pathname of
the root, and procedure used to search for entries in the root.


Arguments:
library_names
   select libraries about which info is printed.  The star convention
   is allowed.  (default: list information about all library roots.)


Control arguments:
-name, -nm
   prints all names of selected library roots.
-primary, -pri
   prints the primary name of each library root.
-match
   prints root names which match a library_name. (default)
-descriptor desc_name, -desc desc_name
   look for library roots in another library descriptor.  (default:
   look in the default library descriptor.)
-library library_name, -lb library_name
   select libraries about which info is printed.  The star convention
   is allowed.
