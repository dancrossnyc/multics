:Entry:  ascii_to_bcd_:  09/30/83 ascii_to_bcd_


Function:  performs isomorphic conversion from ASCII to BCD.


Syntax:
dcl ascii_to_bcd_ entry (char(*), bit(*));
call ascii_to_bcd_ (ascii_in, bcd_out);


Arguments:
ascii_in
   is the ascii input characters to convert to BCD. (Input)
bcd_out
   is the BCD equivalent of the input string.  Note that both upper
   and lower case ASCII characters are converted to the single case
   BCD characters.  ASCII characters that do not have a match in BCD
   will be converted to a question mark (?). For more information see
   "Notes" below. (Output)


Notes:  The ASCII question mark (?) and any ASCII characters (other
than lowercase letters) will be mapped into a BCD question mark (?).
Lowercase letters will be mapped into the equivalent uppercase letter.
The valid BCD characters are as follows:

0123456789[@:?ABCDEFGHI&.](<\^JKLMNOPQR-$*);'+/STUVWXYZ_,%=!#<space>
