Introduction:  This is a brief description of the procedures needed to make use
of either relation or attribute level security within MRDS.


Definitions:
A database administrator (DBA) is a user holding sma access on the database
directory.  A secure submodel is a version 5 submodel residing in the
secure.submodels directory under the database.  A database is secured if the
command secure_mrds_db has been run against it, and the -reset option has not
been subsequently used.


Relation level security:
Control of access to the database data on a relation level is done via Multics
acl's.  To set access for a user to relation personnel under database
employee.db the following access must be set:

employees.db>db_model needs r acl

employees.db>db.control needs rw acl

employees.db>personnel.m needs r acl

employees.db>personnel needs X acl, where X is the desired relation data access
of n, r, or rw

All these acls of course being set for the person.project to whom access is
being granted.


Attribute level security:
Control of access to the database data at attribute level requires the use of a
secure submodel on a secured database for non-DBA's.  The Multics acl's must be
set up as for relation access control.	However the secure submodel must have
access control statements that speicify the additional attribute access, so
MRDS may manage the additional access restrictions above those applied by the
Multics acl's.

For example, if the salary attribute in the above personnel relation is to be
given null access for the Benefits project, the following could be done:

create the submodel source:

relation:	 personnel(last_name first_name address salary) ;

attribute access: salary in personnel (null) ;

Use the command create_mrds_dsm -install on this submodel source.  Then give
the Benefits project read access on the resulting submodel, and only that
submodel.	 Then when a user in Benefits accesses the employee database, he will
not be able to read salary.
