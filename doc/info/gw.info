phonetically.


Arguments:

Control arguments:
-length N, -ln N
   specifies length of the words to be generated.  3<length<21.
-min N
   specifies minimum length of the words to be generated.
   3<min<max<21.  (Default is 6).

-seed N
   allows the user to specify a value for the word generated.  The
   value must be a non-negative integer.  A value of zero indicates

   that the same seed is used.  (Default is 0).
