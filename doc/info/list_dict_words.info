07/23/84  list_dict_words, ldw

Syntax as a command:  ldw path {words} {-control_args}


Function:  The list_dict_words command displays a list of words in a
wordpro dictionary.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the dictionary to be listed.  If path does not
   have the suffix dict, one is assumed; however, dict must be the last
   component of the dictionary segment name.
words
   are words to be listed.  If no words are specified, and if the
   -input_file control argument is not specified, all words in the
   dictionary are listed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message usually given when a word is not
   found in the dictionary.
-input_file path, -if path
   lists the words contained in the segment specified by path.  Words
   in this segment should be separated by newlines.  This control
   argument may be specified more than once.
-output_file path, -of path
   writes words to be listed into the segment specified by path instead
   of printing words on the user's terminal.  The words are separated
   by newlines in the output segment.


-raw
   displays the words without indicating the no-trim attribute or
   hyphenation points.  Otherwise, words are listed in the format
   accepted by the add_dict_words command above.
-word string
   lists the word string even though string may look like a control
   argument.


Notes:  When listing an entire dictionary, or any large number of
dictionary words, it may be convenient to use the list_dict_words
command together with the print_wordlist command to obtain multiple
column output.  This is accomplished by using the -output_file control
argument to create a wordlist (i.e., a segment whose entryname has the
suffix wl).  The resulting wordlist can then be printed by the
print_wordlist command.
