:Entry: cv_oct_check_: 02/06/84  cv_oct_check_

Function: takes an ASCII representation of an octal integer and
returns the fixed binary(35) representation of that number.  This
function differs from the cv_oct_ function only in that a code is
returned indicating the possibility of a conversion error.  (See also
cv_oct_.)


Syntax:
declare cv_oct_check_ entry (char(*), fixed bin(35)) returns
     (fixed bin(35));
a = cv_oct_check_ (string, code);


Arguments:
string
   is the string to be converted.  It must be nonvarying.  (Input)
code
   is a code that equals 0 if no error occurred; otherwise it is the
   index of the character that terminated the conversion.  See "Notes"
   below.  (Output)
a
   is the result of the conversion.  (Output)


Notes:  Code is not a standard status code and, therefore, cannot be
passed to com_err_ and other subroutines that accept only standard
status codes.
