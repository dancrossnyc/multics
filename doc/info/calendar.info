02/23/84	calendar

Syntax:  calendar {paths} {-control_args}


Function:	 prints a calendar page for one month.  The preceding and
following months are also shown.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments that contain a list of events in the
   form of text to be inserted into the calendar.


Control arguments:
-date DATE, -dt DATE
   identifies which month is printed.  DATE must be acceptable to
   convert_date_to_binary_ (see date_time_strings.gi.info).
   If -date is not given, the current month is printed.
-fiscal_week, -fw
   labels boxes with fiscal week numbers.
-wait, -wt
   causes the command to wait for a single newline character from you
   before printing the calendar.
-stop, -sp
   causes the command to wait for a single newline character from you
   before printing the calendar and after printing it.


-force, -fc
   prints a calendar regardless of errors in the input files.
-box_height HEIGHT, -bht HEIGHT
   changes the height of each calendar box from seven lines to HEIGHT
   lines.  If HEIGHT is greater than seven, calendars for previous and
   following months do not appear in margin.
-julian, -jul
   prints "julian dates" in bottom line of each box--the number
   of days from the beginning of the year and the number of days
   remaining in the year.


Notes on output: Each box for a calendar day is 16 characters wide and
seven lines high unless otherwise determined by -box_height.  Each box
in the calendar contains the number of the day of the month; other
information can also appear in the box, at your option.  The month
preceding the specified month and the month following it are also
printed.


Notes on input: Each segment contains lines that set up a string to be
inserted into the appropriate box of the calendar.  The fields in
these lines are separated by commas and have the form

   opcode,dtfield,...,dtfield,text

The first field is the operation code (date, rel, repeat, easter, or
rename).  The second and succeeding fields depend on which operation
code is used.  Lines that produce a date not in the current month are
ignored.


List of operation codes:
date
   inserts a note for a specified date.  It has the syntax:

            date,DT,TEXT

   where DT is the date and TEXT is arbitrary text up to 16 characters
   long.


rel
   inserts a note for a day that is calculated relative to the
   beginning of a month.  Its syntax is:

            rel,MONTHNO,RELDT1,RELDT2,TEXT.

      MONTHNO is a one- or two-digit number from one to 12
   indicating the month from which the event is to be calculated, or
   can be -1, 0 or +1 (-1 indicates the month previous to the printed
   month, 0 refers to the month being printed, and +1 indicates the
   month after the printed month.
      RELDT1 is a date converted relative to the day before the
   beginning of the specified month.  RELDT2 is a date that is
   converted relative to the date indicated by the RELDT1 of the
   third field.  It specifies the date selected for the insertion of
   the TEXT.
      TEXT is arbitrary text.


repeat
   inserts a note into the boxes for several days that are separated
   by a constant interval of time.  The syntax is:

           repeat,STARTDT,END_OR_COUNT,INTERVAL,TEXT

      STARTDT is the date on which the series of events starts.  Zero
   indicates that the series starts on the first day of the printed
   month.
      END_OR_COUNT is the end date or 0, or a count of the number of
   events in the series.  Zero indicates that the series continues
   throughout the entire month being printed.  An integer number gives
   the number of events in the series.


      INTERVAL is any offset acceptable to convert_date_to_binary_
   or 0.  An offset is truncated to an integral number of days; but if
   it is less than one day, it is treated as if it were 1 day.  Zero
   indicates an interval of 1 day.
      TEXT is arbritrary text to be placed in the box of each day in
   the series.


easter
   calculates the date for Easter and inserts its text in that date if
   it falls in the printed month.  The syntax is:

            easter,TEXT


rename
   allows you to change the names of days or months.  Its syntax is:

            rename,OLDNAME,NEWNAME.

      OLDNAME gives the name of a day or month to be changed. If the
   name of that day or month was previously changed in the current
   invocation of the command, OLDNAME must be the current name.
      NEWNAME gives the name to replace the OLDNAME.


Notes: All dates must be acceptable to convert_date_to_binary.  See
date_time_strings.gi.info for acceptable forms.

If the command finds errors in its arguments, it reports the errors
and does not print a calendar.  If it finds errors in an input file,
it stops after all errors have been reported, unless you use -force to
indicate that the calendar should be printed in spite of errors.
