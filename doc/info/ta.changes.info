This info describes changes to the tape_archive utility.


Version 4, MR10.2:

o  independent densities for primary and alternate volume sets are 
   supported.  A new optional control argument '-alternate' may be
   specified on the 'ta alter table density N' request to indicate
   which volume set density is to be changed.
   
o  all mount requests issued by tape_archive contain a '-density'
   argument to enable the system to choose an appropriate tape drive
   in a mixed hardware configuration.  It is currently possible (but
   not likely) for a tape_archive volume set to actually be recorded
   at a density different from that specified in the table.  With
   version 4 the recording density in the table MUST match the
   corresponding volume set density.  If problems are encountered in
   this area, the actual recording density of a volume set can be
   determined using the read_tape_and_query utility and the tape
   archive table can be brought into step using the 'ta alter table
   density N' request.


o  'xd' and 'xdf' requests have been added which extract a component
   and then delete it from the tape archive.
   
o  the 'cancel' request can correctly reinstate components dead
   components which have been processed as deleted but are still on
   the volume set.
   
o  the 't' request produces header information when -long is
   specified and the table is empty.


o  an auto_compaction limit of 1.0 is handled correctly and never
   causes automatic scheduling of volume set compaction.
   
o  'r'-type requests issued for a non-existent table proceed by
   creating the table with a warning.
   
o  extra checks have been added to prevent the deletion of the active
   tape_archive table out from under current processing.      

o  redundant tape mounts have been eliminated by only writing the
   tape_archive table to tape if the volume set has in fact changed.
