:Entry: unique_chars_: 02/03/84  unique_chars_


Function: provides a character-string representation of a bit string.
If the bit string is supplied by the unique_bits_ subroutine, this
character string is unique among all character strings generated in
this manner in the history of this Multics installation and is
therefore useful as an identifier.


Syntax:
declare unique_chars_ entry (bit(*)) returns (char(15));
char_string = unique_chars_ (bits);


Arguments:
char_string
   is a unique character string.  (Output)
bits
   is a bit string of up to 70 bits.  (Input) See "Notes" below.


Notes:  If the bits argument is less than 70 bits in length,
unique_chars_ pads it with zeros on the right to produce a 70-bit
string.  If the bits argument equals zero, unique_chars_ calls
unique_bits_ to obtain a unique bit string.

The first character in the character string produced is always an
exclamation point to identify the string as a unique identifier.  The
remaining 14 characters that form the unique identifier are
alphanumeric, excluding vowels.
