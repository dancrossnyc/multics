01/24/83  rbf_

The rbf_ I/O module performs record oriented I/O to a remote I/O
terminal that has the characteristics of the Honeywell Level 6M
Satellite remote batch facility operating over an X.25 connection.  The
hardware options currently supported are defined by the control
arguments described below.

Entry points in this module are not called directly by users; rather,
the module is accessed through the I/O system.


Syntax for Attach Description:
     rbf_ -control_args


Control arguments:
   are optional with the exception of -device, -comm, and -tty.  All
   others are passed through as part of the attach description
   for the communications I/O module specified via -comm.
-ascii
   uses the ASCII character set.  This is the default.  This argument
   is accepted for compatibility with other terminal I/O modules.
-comm STR
   uses the communications I/O module specified by STR where STR must
   be "tty_".
-device STR
   attaches the subdevice specified by STR.  STR can be printer, punch,
   reader or teleprinter.


-physical_line_length N, -pll N
   specifies the physical line length, N, of the output device.  This
   argument is accepted for compatibility with other terminal I/O
   modules.
-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   specifies the terminal type whose translation tables defined in the
   user or system terminal type table (TTT) are used to translate input
   and output to and from the device.  If not specified, no translation
   is performed.  Input and output translation tables can be up to 256
   characters in length.
-tty STR
   connects the remote I/O terminal to the logical communications
   channel named STR.


Open Operation:
The rbf_ I/O module supports the sequential_input, sequential_output,
and sequential_input_output opening modes.


Write Record Operation:
The write_record entry performs the appropriate translation on the data
record, converts the supplied slew control into the proper carriage
control sequences for line printer attachments and performs data
compression.  The records are then transmitted to the specified
communications channel.

The format of the record supplied to this I/O module is the
terminal_io_record structure.  This structure and the referenced
constants are contained in terminal_io_record.incl.pl1.


Read Record Operation:
The read_record entry reads characters from the communications channel
and returns a single record from the device, basically performing the
inverse of the functions described for the write_record operation.

The format of the record this I/O module returns in the supplied
buffer is the terminal_io_record structure.  This structure and the
referenced constants are contained in terminal_io_record.incl.pl1.


Control Operation:
This I/O module supports all the control operations supported by the
tty_ I/O module.  In addition, it supports the following:
runout
   transmits any data stored in the output buffer.  There is no input
   structure.
end_write_mode
   prevents rbf_ from returning until all outstanding output has been
   written to the attached channel.  There is no input structure.


Modes Operation:
This I/O module supports the rawi, rawo, and 8bit modes.


Notes: The select_device, reset, and binary_punch control orders are
ignored, but are accepted for compatibility with other I/O modules.
