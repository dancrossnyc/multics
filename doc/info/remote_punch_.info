03/31/83  remote_punch_


Function: The remote_punch_ I/O module presents a stream I/O interface
to the caller and performs record output to a card punch, which is
assumed to be part of a remote I/O device, such as a Honeywell Level 6
remote batch facility (G115 type), an IBM 2780, or an IBM 3780.
Except for hardware restrictions, this module performs all the
necessary code conversion and control in such a way that remote and
local card punching are the same.

Entry points in this module are not called directly by users; rather,
the module is accessed through the I/O system.

This module in turn constructs an attach description for the module
specified in the -terminal control argument, passing the other attach
information specified by the caller.


Syntax and Attach Description:
     remote_punch_ -control_arg


Control arguments:
-card_ll N
   specifies the length of records (cards) supported by the terminal
   I/O module.  (Default is 80.)
-device STR
   defines the type of device to be simulated by this I/O module and
   can be either "punch" or "reader_simulator".  This specification is
   passed to the terminal I/O module as "-device punch" or "-device
   reader", respectively.  (Default is "punch".)
-horizontal_tab, -htab
   specifies that the device supports the horizontal tab character.
   (Default is the use of the appropriate number of spaces.)
-non_edited
   specifies that nonprinting characters can be passed directly to the
   terminal I/O module.  (Default is that these characters are not
   passed.)


-runout_spacing N, -rnsp N
-physical_page_length N, -ppl N
   are accepted and ignored for compatibility with other device I/O
   modules.
-terminal STR
   STR specifies the terminal I/O module to be attached to this device
   I/O module.  (Required)

All other attach arguments are passed directly to the terminal I/O
   module.


Open Operation:
The remote punch I/O module supports the stream_output opening mode.


Put Chars Operation:
The put_chars entry splits the data to be written into records of the
size given by -card_ll and transmits these records to the terminal I/O
module.  This operation is repeated until all the characters specified
by the caller have been transmitted.


List of Control Operations:
   The remote_punch device I/O module supports the following control
   operations:
binary_punch
   requests that all subsequent data be punched in binary (rather than
   RMCC) if supported by the terminal I/O module.  This control order
   is then passed on to the terminal I/O module.
get_count
   returns the current record count, which is the number of records
   written to the terminal I/O module since the last reset control
   operation.  This operation is not passed on to the terminal I/O
   module.  The info_ptr must point to the following PL/1 structure.
   (This structure is taken from the counts structure in
   prt_order_info.incl.pl1 for compatibility with procedures that use
   several device I/O modules.)


      dcl 1 counts aligned based,
            2 prt_data_pad (4) fixed bin,
            2 record_count fixed bin (35),
            2 prt_pad fixed bin;

   The variable record_count will contain the returned value.  This
   corresponds with the variable line_count from the other structure.
reset
   sets the current record count to zero, returns to punching in RMCC
   (remote Multics card code), and passes the order to the terminal I/O
   module.

All other control operations are passed directly to the terminal I/O
module for processing.


Modes Operation:
This I/O module supports the RMCC output card mode defined in the
Programmer's Reference Manual.  It also supports the two modes
non_edited and default, which enable and disable edited output
conversion, if output conversion has been enabled by the terminal I/O
module.


Position Operation:
This I/O module supports all the position operations supported by the
terminal I/O module specified in the attach description.
