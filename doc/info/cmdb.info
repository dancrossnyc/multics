06/16/86  create_mrds_db, cmdb

Syntax as a command:  cmdb source_path {database_path} {-control_args}


Function:  This command creates an unpopulated MRDS data base from a
data model source segment.


Arguments:
source_path
   is the pathname of a data model source segment.  If source_path does
   not have a suffix of cmdb, then one is assumed.  However, the cmdb
   suffix must be the last component of the name of the source segment.
database_path
   is the pathname of the data base to be created.  If database_path is
   not given as an argument, then the data base is created in the
   working directory with the same name as the source segment with a db
   (rather than a cmdb) suffix.  If database_path is given as an
   argument, then the db suffix is added automatically if not given
   with the argument.


Control arguments:
-data_management_file {STR}, -dmf {STR}
   creates relation data files that are manipulated by the Multics Data
   Management System.  STR is an optional mode string that defines the
   characteristics of the data management files.  This mode string
   applies to all relations created in the data base.  See Notes for a
   list of valid modes.  The directories under which the listing
   segment and the data base directory are to be created must have
   append access for the user, similarly for the temp_dir if used.  The
   containing directory access must be "sm", if -force is used.
-force, -fc
   causes an existing data base of the same pathname as the given or
   default pathname to be deleted and this new data base to be created
   in its place.


-list, -ls
   a segment containing a listing of the data model source, followed by
   detailed information about each relation and attribute in the
   resulting data base.  This segment is created in the working
   directory and has the same name as the source segment with list
   (rather than cmdb) as the suffix.
-no_force, -nfc
   does not allow a data base of the same pathname as the given or
   default pathname to be created when such a data base already exists.
   (Default)
-no_list, -nls
   indicates that no listing is to be created.  (Default)
-no_secure
   causes the data base to be created in the unsecured state.
   (Default)


-secure
   causes the data base to be created in the secured state.  See the
   secure_mrds_db command for details on the secured state.  Also refer
   to Section 7 for information on the effect of the secured state on
   commands and subroutines.
-temp_dir path
   provides for a directory with more quota than the default of the
   process directory when more temporary storage is needed to do a
   create_mrds_db on a source with many relations and attributes.  For
   example, doing a create_mrds_db on a 256 relation source requires
   this argument.  If the user gets a record quota overflow in the
   process directory during a create_mrds_db, then a new_process is
   required.  A retry of the create_mrds_db with the -temp_dir
   argument, giving a pathname of a directory with more quota than the
   process directory, can then be done.


-vfile, -vf
   creates relation data files that are manipulated by vfile_.
   (Default)


Notes:  The largest data base that can be created is 256 relations.
MRDS allows 256 attributes per relation.


If the mode appears in the mode string preceeded by "^", then the mode
is set to off.  In the case of duplicate mode specifications, the last
mode specified takes effect.


The default for protection is on.  If protection is on, the default for
concurrency and rollback is also on.  If protection is off, the default
for concurrency and rollback is off.  If no mode string is specified in
the -data_management_file control argument, a default mode string of
"protection,concurrency,rollback" is used.


List of modes:  (for use with -data_management_file control argument)
protection
   creates relations as protected data management files.  Relations
   created with this mode can be accessed only if the process is in a
   transaction.
concurrency
   provides concurrency control when accessing relations.  This mode is
   valid only if protection is enabled.
rollback
   provides rollback before images are taken when updating a relation.
   This mode is valid only if protection is enabled.
