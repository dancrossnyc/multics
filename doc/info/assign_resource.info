02/21/84  assign_resource, ar

Syntax:  ar resource_type {-control_args}


Syntax as active function:  [ar resource_type {control_args}]


Function:  calls the Resource Control Package (RCP) to assign a
resource to your process.


Arguments:
resource_type
   specifies the type of resource to be assigned.  Currently, only
   device types can be designated.  The -device control argument is
   used to name a specific device to assign.  Other control arguments
   are used to indicate characteristics of the device to be assigned.
   The following device type keywords are supported:

     tape_drive
     disk_drive
     console
     printer
     punch
     reader
     special


Control arguments:
-comment STR, -com STR
   is a comment string that is displayed to the operator when the
   resource is assigned.  If more than one string is required, the
   entire string must be in quotes.  Only printable ASCII characters
   are allowed.  Any unprintable characters (also tabs or new lines)
   found in this string are converted to blanks.
-density N, -den N
   specifies the density capability characteristic of a tape drive.
   There can be more than one instance of this argument.  A tape drive
   is assigned that is capable of being set to all of the indicated
   densities.  The acceptable values for this argument are 200, 556,
   800, 1600, and 6250.  Note that the values permitted depend on the
   particular hardware on the system.


-device STR, -dv STR
   specifies the name of the device to be assigned.  If used, other
   control arguments that indicate device characteristics are ignored.
   If used with -long, a message containing the name of the assigned
   device is printed on your terminal; otherwise, no message is
   printed.  If found several times on the command line, the last one
   specified overrides any previous ones.
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length of a printer.  Its value must be one that
   is found in the "line length" field of a printer PRPH configuration
   card.  If this field is not specified on that type of card, this
   device characteristic is ignored for this printer.


-long, -lg
   prints all the device characteristics of the assigned device.  If
   not supplied, only the name of the assigned device is printed.
-model N
   specifies the device model number characteristic.  Only a device
   that has this model number is assigned.  In order to find the model
   numbers that are acceptable, use the print_configuration_deck
   command.
-number N, -nb N
   specifies the number of resources to assign.  All the resources
   assigned have the device characteristics indicated by any other
   arguments passed to this command.  If -number is not given, one
   resource is assigned.


-speed N
   gives the speed of a tape drive.  The acceptable values depend on
   the particular hardware on the system and can be 75, 125, or 200.
-system, -sys
   specifies that you want to be treated as a system process during
   this assignment.  If not used or if you do not have the appropriate
   access, then the RCP assumes that this assignment is for a nonsystem
   process.
-track N, -tk N
   specifies the track characteristic of a tape drive.  The value can
   be either 9 or 7.  If both -track and -volume are not given, a track
   value of 9 is used when assigning a tape device.
-train N, -tn N
   specifies the print train characteristic of a printer.


-volume STR, -vol STR
   specifies the name of a volume.  If possible, the device assigned is
   one on which this volume has already been placed.  If this is not
   possible (e.g., the volume is on a device assigned to a process) any
   available, appropriate, and accessible device is assigned.
-wait {N}, -wt {N}
   indicates that you want to wait if the assignment cannot be
   made at this time because the resources are assigned to some other
   process.  The value N designates the maximum number of minutes to
   wait.  If N minutes elapse and a resource is not yet assigned, an
   error message is printed.  If N is not specified, it is assumed that
   you want to wait indefinitely.


Notes:  An assigned device still must be attached by a call to some I/O
module.  If a device is successfully assigned, the name of the device
is printed.  (If you request a specific device that is successfully
assigned, the name of the device is not printed unless you ask for it.)


Notes on active function:  The active function returns either true if
an assignment was successful or false if the resource is unavailable.
Other errors are reported by active_fnc_error_.  The -long control
argument is not allowed.  Use the list_resources command to obtain the
name of the assigned device(s).
