03/19/85  ft_window_


This is the basic video interface subroutine to be used by FORTRAN to
create/destroy/change windows.  (This subroutine should not be called
if usage_mode = 0 (see ft_menu_$init2)).  Its facilities are available
through the following entry points.


Entry points in ft_window_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  change:  03/19/85 ft_window_$change


Function:  This entry point is used to change the size of an existing
window.  The size of a window can always be "shrunk", however it can be
increased only it does not overlap with another defined window.  (This
entry point should not be called if usage_mode = 0 (see
ft_menu_$init2).)


Syntax:
   declarations:
     integer  window_id
     integer  first_line
     integer  height
     integer  code
   call ft_window_$change (window_id, first_line, heigth, code)



Arguments:
window_id
   window identifier returned by ft_window_$create (or by ft_menu_$init
   in the case of the user i/o window).  (Input)
first_line
   new first line number for the window being changed.  (Input)
   Positive integer.
height
   new height for the window being changed.  (Input) Positive integer.
code
   return code.  (Output)


:Entry:  clear_window:  03/19/85 ft_window_$clear_window


Function:  Used to clear a specified window.


Syntax:
   declarations:
     integer       window_id
     integer       code
   call ft_window_$clear_window (window_id, code)



Arguments:
window_id
   The window identifier (returned by ft_window_$create) of the window
   to be cleared.  (Input)
code
   return code.  (Output)


:Entry:  create:  03/19/85 ft_window_$create


Function:  Used to create a new window on the terminal screen.  (This
entry point should not be called if usage_mode = 0.)  (see
ft_menu_$init2)


Syntax:
   declarations:
     character*32  switch_name
     integer       window_id
     integer       first_line
     integer       height
     integer       code
   call ft_window_$create (first_line, height, switch_name,
          window_id, code)


Arguments:
first_line
   is the line number where the window is to start.  (Input)
height
   the number of lines used by the window, i.e., its height.  (Input)
switch_name
   the  name  that  the caller  wishes  to associate  with  the switch.
   (Input)  (The caller  may use the  switch name, for  example, in the
   FORTRAN "open" statement.)
window_id
   the returned id of the window just created.  (Output) It must not be
   altered in any way by the application program.
code
   return code.  (Output)


:Entry:  destroy:  03/19/85 ft_window_$destroy


Function:  Used  to destroy a  previously created window.   (This entry
point should not be called if usage_mode = 0 (see ft_menu_$init2).)


Syntax:
   declarations:
     integer  window_id
     integer  code
   call ft_window_$destroy (window_id, code)



Arguments:
window_id
   window    identifier    (returned    by    the   ft_window_$create).
   (Input/Output) It is reset to an illegal value by this call.
code
   return code.  (Output)
