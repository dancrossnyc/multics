02/13/84  aim_check_

The aim_check_ subroutine provides a number of entry points for
determining the relationship between two access attributes.  An access
attribute can be either an authorization or an access class.  See also
the read_allowed_, read_write_allowed_, and write_allowed_ subroutines.


Entry points in aim_check_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  equal:  02/13/84 aim_check_$equal


Function:  This entry point compares two access attributes to determine
whether they satisfy the equal relationship of the access isolation
mechanism (AIM).


Syntax:
declare aim_check_$equal entry (bit(72) aligned, bit(72) aligned)
     returns (bit(1) aligned);
returned_bit = aim_check_$equal (acc_att1, acc_att2);


Arguments:
acc_atti
   are access attributes.  (Input)
returned_bit
   is the result of the comparison.  (Output)
   "1"b   acc_att1 equals acc_att2.
   "0"b   acc_att1 does not equal acc_att2.


:Entry:  greater:  02/13/84 aim_check_$greater


Function:  This entry point compares two access attributes to determine
whether they satisfy the greater-than relationship of the AIM.


Syntax:
declare aim_check_$greater entry (bit(72) aligned, bit(72) aligned)
     returns (bit(1) aligned);
returned_bit = aim_check_$greater (acc_att1, acc_att2);


Arguments:
acc_atti
   are access attributes.  (Input)
returned_bit
   is the result of the comparison.  (Output)
   "1"b   acc_att1 is greater than acc_att2.
   "0"b   acc_att1 is not greater than acc_att2.


:Entry:  greater_or_equal:  02/13/84 aim_check_$greater_or_equal


Function:  This entry point compares two access attributes to determine
whether they satisfy either the greater-than or the equal relationships
of the AIM.


Syntax:
declare aim_check_$greater_or_equal entry (bit(72) aligned, bit(72)
     aligned) returns (bit(1) aligned);
returned_bit = aim_check_$greater_or_equal (acc_att1, acc_att2);


Arguments:
acc_atti
   are access attributes.  (Input)
returned_bit
   is the result of the comparison.  (Output)
   "1"b   acc_att1 is greater than or equal to acc_att2.
   "0"b   acc_att1 is not greater than or equal to acc_att2.
