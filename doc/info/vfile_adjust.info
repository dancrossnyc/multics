07/13/83  vfile_adjust, vfa

Syntax:  vfa path {-control_arg}


Function:  adjusts structured files left in an inconsistent state by an
interrupted opening, or unstructured files in any state.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a file to be adjusted.


Control arguments:  must be specified only for unstructured files.
-set_bc
   sets the bit count of the file's last nonempty segment to the last
   nonzero byte in that segment.  Any components beyond it are deleted.
-set_nl
   appends a newline character if the last nonzero byte in the file is
   not a newline character.  The bit count of the file's last nonempty
   segment is then set to the file's last nonzero byte (which is now
   sure to be a newline character).
-use_bc {N}
   truncates the file to the byte specified by the bit count of
   multisegment file component N.  If N is not given, it is taken to be
   the last nonempty component.
-use_nl
   truncates the file after the last newline character.


Notes:  For unstructured files a control argument must specify the
desired adjustment; otherwise, no control arguments are allowed.  A
sequential or blocked file is adjusted by truncation after the last
complete record.  An indexed file is adjusted by finishing the
interrupted operation.

The adjust_bit_count command used with -character is equivalent to
vfile_adjust used with -set_bc except that the latter only operates on
a file that appears to be unstructured.

See the description of the vfile_ I/O module in the Subroutines manual
for further details.
