Syntax:  lor {request_identifier} {-control_args}


Function:  lists requests in the I/O daemon queue.


Arguments:
   request_identifier can be chosen from the following.  If no
   request_identifier is specified, all requests are listed.
path
   is the relative pathname of one or more requests to be listed.  The
   star convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   selects only requests whose entry names match STR.  The star
   convention is allowed.  Directory portions of request pathnames are
   not used for selecting requests.
-id ID
   selects only requests whose request_ids match ID.  Type "help
   request_ids".


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the full pathname.
-admin {User_id}, -am {User_id}
   selects requests of all users or of the specified user.  Default is
   to list the user's own requests.  Requires r extended access to the
   queue(s) to read other users' requests.  See Notes below.
-all, -a
   searches all queues.
-brief, -bf
   prevents printing of comment and request state in normal (not -long)
   mode.
-forms {STR}
   selects only requests with special forms specified.  If you specify
   STR, only requests with special forms matching STR are chosen.


-immediate, -im
   selects only I/O requests that are not deferred.  With -position,
   ignores deferred requests when computing position.
-long, -lg
   prints all information about each selected request, including long
   request_id and full pathname.  Default is to print short request_id
   and entryname.
-long_id, -lgid
   prints the long request_id.
-position, -psn
   prints queue positions of each selected request.  With -total,
   prints a list of queue positions.  Requires r extended access to the
   queue(s), to read other users' requests.


-queue N, -q N
   searches only queue N.  If this control argument is not specified,
   all queues are searched but nothing is printed for queues from
   which no requests are selected.
-print, -pr
   specifies that the requests listed are found in the queue(s)
   associated with the default printer request type.  See Notes below.
-punch, -pch
   specifies that the requests listed are found in the queue(s)
   associated with the default punch request type.  See Notes below.
-plot
   specifies that the requests listed are found in the queue(s)
   associated with the default plotter request type.  See Notes below.


-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   searches the I/O daemon queues belonging to the specified request
   type.  See Notes below.
-total, -tt
   prints only the total number of selected requests and the total
   number in the queue.  Incompatible with -long and -brief control
   arguments.
-user User_id
   selects only requests of the specified user.  Requires r extended
   access to the queue(s).  See Notes below.


Notes: Only request types belonging to the printer, punch, or plotter
generic types can be specified by the -request_type control argument
when the -long argument is given.  A list of these request types can be
obtained by invoking the print_request_types command.


The -print, -punch, -plot and -request_type control arguments are
mutually exclusive.  Only one may be used in a given command.  If none
are given, then lor lists the default request type used by eor -print
(as displayed by the print_request_types command).


The User_id arguments specified after -admin or -user can have any of
the following forms:
   Person_id.Project_id   matches that user only
   Person_id.*            matches that person on any project
   Person_id              same as Person_id.*
   *.Project_id           matches any user on that project
   .Project_id            same as *.Project_id
   *.*                    same as -admin with no User_id following it.

If -admin User_id or -user User_id is given more than once in a
command, only the final instance is used.
