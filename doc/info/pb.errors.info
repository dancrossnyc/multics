Description

106  none
(value) When asked to print the value of a fixed(17) aligned where the
lower 18 bits are on and some of the higher bits (but not the sign bit)
are on, prints nothing for the value.

103  phx05071
(debug) Drop in support of debug.

99  none
(display) "ds addr(foo)" displays foo not the pointer.  Should require
the * argument to indirect through the pointer.

98  phx18872
(position) With regexp as 1st probe request, produces out_of_bounds.

85  none
(before) When setting many breaks ("b /^.*$/"), goes into a loop after
several are set, printing the next one's "Break set before..." message.
Reported 07/26/84 by Fakoury.Tolts

82  phx17733
Blows up referencing runtime_symbol_info_$father.

78  none
Ring-4 gate gets wrong source_info.entry_ptr, results in wrong value
from probe_block_name_.

64  phx16904
(value) Interprets "foo based (p(3))" as p(1)->foo.  Limitation in
symbol table.

58  none
Fix probe_trace_stack_ to get block ptr if there is no statement map.
MR10.1 version worked by calling old stu_$get_runtime_block.  Current
version calls stu_$find_containing_block.  Needed by Gary Palter for
rdm debug_mode.

41  phx15479
Can't get the address of based(addr()) or defined() variables.  This is
a limitation in the symbol table.

25  phx14468
Gets confused if builtin and variable have the same name.

13  phx14172
Cannot get the source line for a PL/1 I/O statement that signalled
size.  Bug in put_field (pl1 operators), loses track of the instruction
it was at when it called plio2, which signalled size.

4  phx11733
Probe should handle language differences in input syntax.

3  phx10184
(value) Prints fixed bin unsigned numbers incorrectly.  Bug in
assign_$computational_, reported to JRGray.Calgary.
