Syntax as active function:  [index_set {F1} B1 {I1} ...  Fn Bn In]


Function:  returns one or more integers, separated from each other by
spaces.


Arguments:
F
   is the first number of a set, and must be an integer.  This argument
   is optional (see "Examples").
B
   is a bound on the set, and must be an integer.
I
   is the increment between the numbers of a set, either a positive or
   negative integer.  If F > B, then I is assumed to be a negative
   integer.  Otherwise, I is assumed to be positive.  This argument is
   optional.


Notes:  If more than one F-B-I triple is specified, F, B, and I must be
specified in each triple.  If only one F-B-I triple is specified, I or
both I and F can be omitted.  I and F are assumed to be 1 if omitted.
