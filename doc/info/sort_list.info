10/20/86  sort_list, sls


Syntax as a command:  sls path -control_args


Function:  sorts the records in the specified lister file.  The records
are sorted according to the fields specified in the -sort control
argument.  Fields are sorted without regard to case; that is, they are
sorted in alphabetical order, not in the ASCII order.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file to be sorted.  The suffix lister
   must be the last component of the lister file name; however, if path
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppresses error messages for lister files that have no records.
-sort STR, -st STR
   specifies how the records in the lister file are to be sorted.  This
   is a required argument.


Notes:  The sort_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the sort is not performed, for some reason
other than an empty lister file, or the invocation of sort_list
terminates abnormally.  A severity of 1 is set when the lister file has
no records.  A severity of 0 is set when the sort is completed and the
command terminates normally.
