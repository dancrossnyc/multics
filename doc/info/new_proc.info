02/18/85  new_proc

Syntax as a command:  new_proc {-control_arg}


Function: destroys your current process and creates a new one, using
the control arguments given initially with login and -authorization.


Control arguments:
-authorization STR, -auth STR
   creates the new process at authorization STR, where STR is any
   authorization acceptable to the convert_authorization_ subroutine.
   The authorization must be less than, or equal to, both the maximum
   authorization of the process and the access class of the terminal.
   (Default: to create the new process at the same authorization)


Notes: Just before the old process is destroyed, the "finish"
condition is signaled.  After the default on unit returns, all open
files are closed.  The search rules, I/O attachments, and working
directory for the new process are as if you had just logged in.

If your initial working directory contains the segment start_up.ec and
you did not log in with -no_start_up, new_proc automatically issues the
command line "exec_com start_up new_proc interactive" in the new
process.


If your site is security conscious, it may have disabled "new_proc
-auth"; in this case if you wish to change authorization, do this:
   1. log out
   2. verify, using terminal/modem indications, that the terminal has
      dropped DTR and that the system acknowledged by dropping DSR
   3. log in at the new authorization.

This procedure is the only way to guarantee that you are communicating
with the answering service and not with a Trojan horse.

DTR and DSR are EIA RS232 control signals that are part of the
interface between your terminal and the system.
