Syntax:  apl {workspace_id} {-control_args}


Function: invokes the APL interpreter, optionally loading a saved
workspace.


Arguments:
workspace_id
   is the pathname of a saved workspace to be loaded.  The default is
   to load your continue workspace, if any; otherwise a clear workspace
   is loaded.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   prints short error messages.  (Default)
-check, -ck
   raises a compatibility error if a monadic transpose of rank greater
   than 2 or a residue or encode with a negative-left argument is
   encountered.  (The definition of these cases in  Version 2 APL is
   different from Version 1.)
-long_errors, -lge
   prints long error messages.  The short form of the message is
   printed, followed by a detailed explanation of the error.
-temp_dir path, -td path
   changes the directory that used to hold the temporary segments that
   contain the active workspace to path. The default is to use the
   process directory.


-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   specifies the kind of terminal being used.  Possible values of STR
   are 1050, 2741, CORR2741, ARDS, TN300, TEK4013, TEK4015, 1030,
   TYPEPAIRED, BITPAIRED, ASCII, TELERAY11, LA36.    This control
   argument specifies which one of several character translation tables
   is to be used by APL when reading or writing to the terminal.  Since
   there are different kinds of APL terminals, each incompatible with
   the rest, it is important that the correct table be used.
-user_number N
   sets the APL user number (returned by some APL functions) to N.  The
   default is 100.


Control arguments for debugging:
-debug, -db
   calls the listener (cu_$cl) upon system errors.  This puts you at a
   new command level.  The default is to remain in APL.  This control
   argument is intended for debuggin apl itself.
-meter
   saves metering information about the APL storage manager.  These
   meters may be displayed with apl_storage_meters.  The default is not
   to save any information.
-no_quit_handler, -nqh
   ignores the quit condition.  The default is to trap all quits within
   apl.


Compatibility with Version 1 APL:  Version 1 APL workspaces can be
manipulated with the )V1COPY, )V1PCOPY, )V1LIB, and )V1DROP system
commands.  There are a number of differences between the two
implementations (see apl_vs_v1apl.info).
