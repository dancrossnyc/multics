05/04/84  explain_doc, edoc

Syntax as a command:  edoc manual_name {-control_args}


Function:  returns information about a specified Multics manual(s).


Arguments:
manual_name
   is the manual's name, a short name for the manual, or the manual's
   order number.  The name or the short name may contain blank spaces;
   it need not be enclosed in quotation marks.  Capitalizing letters is
   not necessary.  Use iteration to get more than one manual.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints all the sections of manual information.
-audience, -aud
   describes the audience for which the manual is intended.
-database_pathname PATH, -dbpn PATH
   specifies the pathname of the data base you want instead of the
   default one.  Once you supply -database_pathname, the specified data
   base is used for all subsequent invocations of explain_doc during
   your process until you select another data base.
-description, -desc
   returns a brief description of the manual's contents.  (Default)
-new_features, -nf
   lists all new features that have been added to the manual with the
   last update (revision or addendum).


-no_audience, -no_aud
   does not describe the manual's intended audience.  (Default)
-no_description, -no_desc
   suppresses printing of the brief description of the manual's
   contents.
-no_new_features, -no_nf
   does not list new features.  (Default)
-no_request_loop, -nrql
   does not enter the request loop.


-no_table_of_contents, -no_toc
   does not print the manual's table of contents.  (Default)
-output_file PATH, -of PATH
   directs the output to a file instead of to your terminal.
-request_loop, -rql
   enters a request loop after the sections specified by control
   arguments have been printed.  (Default)
-table_of_contents, -toc
   prints the manual's table of contents.


Notes on requests:  When you have invoked explain_doc and the section
has been displayed, you are prompted
   More information?

You may respond with one of the following requests--
   yes, y
   ?  (lists available responses)
   description, desc
   audience, aud
   table_of_contents, toc
   new_features, nf
   all, a
   no, n, quit, q  (quits the request loop and returns you to
	         command level).


Notes:  When explain_doc cannot find a data base entry that matches the
manual name supplied, it may, in some cases, find a partial match that
enables it to identify that name as belonging to a particular group
such as the FORTRAN manuals or the Administrator's manuals.  In that
case, the relevant set of manual names is listed, and you can then
choose to see the information on one of those manuals or return to
command level.
