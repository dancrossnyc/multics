10/21/83  Mail System Addresses

An address identifies an originator or a recipient of a message.  A
single address refers to one of the following: a Multics mailbox either
by pathname or User_id, a Forum meeting, a user (or group of users) on
another computer system, an entry in the system's mail table, or a
mailing list.

Each address has three different representations.  The internal
representation of an address is used exclusively by the mail system and
appears to programs which use the mail system as a PL/I pointer
variable.  The printed representation of an address is the human
readble form of an address which is used when displaying a message or
searching a message for a given character string.  The control argument
representation of an address is the sequence of command/request line
arguments and control arguments recognized by the mail system in order
to allow a user to specify one or more addresses on a command/request
line.


List of address types:
   The following types of addresses are supported by the mail system:

user default mailbox address
   identifies a user's default mailbox by both User_id and pathname.
   A user's default mailbox mailbox has the pathname --
         >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx
   and is the mailbox where a user ordinarily receives his incoming
   mail.
logbox address
   identifies a user's logbox by both User_id and pathname.  A user's
   logbox has the pathname --
         >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
   and is one of the mailboxes where a user may store messages for
   future reference.


savebox address
   identifies a user's savebox by both User_id and pathname.  A savebox
   is any mailbox with a suffix of "sv.mbx".  Like the logbox, a user
   normally stores messages in a savebox for future reference.
mailbox address
   identifies any mailbox by pathname which is not a user's default
   mailbox, a logbox, or a savebox.
forum address
   identifies any Forum meeting by pathname.
foreign address
   identifies a user (or group of users) on another computer system.  A
   foreign address consists of an arbitrary character string which is
   the address on the foreign system, the name of the foreign system,
   and optional explicit and implicit address routes which are used to
   aid in the delivery of mail to the address.  See "Address routes"
   below for more information.


mail table address
   identifies an entry in the system's mail table by its name or one of
   its aliases.  In addition to its name and aliases, every entry in
   the mail table includes a mail system address.  When mail is sent to
   a mail table address, it is delivered to the address listed in the
   mail table for that entry.  For more information on the mail table,
   type:
         help mail_table.gi
mailing list address
   identifies a mailing list by pathname.  A mailing list is an ASCII
   segment or archive component which contains the printed
   representations of one or more addresses.  When mail is sent to a
   mailing list, it is delivered to each of the addresses in the list.
   For more information on mailing lists, type:
         help mailing_lists.gi


named group address
   identifies a named group of addresses.  A named group is
   distinguished from a mailing list by the fact that the individual
   addresses which comprise the group appear in the printed
   representation of the address whereas only the pathname of the
   mailing list appears in its printed representation.  Usually, this
   type of address is only found in messages which were created on
   another computer system.
invalid address
   identifies an invalid address.  An invalid address will be created
   by those entrypoints in the mail system which convert printed
   representations of addresses, etc. into their internal
   representation if requested by their callers when a character string
   is found in the printed representation which does not correspond to
   any of the types of address supported by the mail system.  Any
   attempt to send mail to an invalid address will, of course, be
   detected as an error.


Address names:
The address name, which is an optional part of all types of addresses,
is a character string which identifies the person who receives mail at
a given address.  Normally, the address name is the individual's full
name; however, in the case of a mailing list or named group, the
address name is a global description of the individual addresses within
the list.  On some non-Multics systems, several persons are allowed to
share a single address; in these cases, the system uses the address
name to determine for which of these individuals a given message is
intended.


Address comments:
The address comment, which is an optional part of all types of
addresses, is a character string with no semantic meaning that may be
associated with an address.  Although now considered obsolete, the
address comment is still supported by the mail system to provide
compatibilty with prior releases and with non-Multics systems that
still use the address comment in place of the address name.


Address routes:
As mentioned briefly above, a foreign address may include optional
explicit and implicit address routes.  An address route defines the
path through one or more networks to be used to deliver a piece of mail
to a foreign system.  An address route is represented as an ordered
list of system names.  A message is sent by the local system to the
first system in the route; that system then sends the message to the
second system in the route, and so on until the message arrives at its
destination.

The mail system will compute the shortest address route for a given
foreign address at the time that mail is actually sent to that address.
However, this computation may be affected by the explicit and implicit
address routes which are part of that foreign address.


The explicit route, if present, is the address route which has been
specifically requested by a user to be used for the given foreign
address.  The explicit route is normally used to instruct the mail
system how it should deliver mail to a system for which it would not be
able to compute an address route.  However, if present, an explicit
route will always be used by the mail system even when its internal
routing algorithms could compute a shorter route to the destination
system.

The implicit route, if present, is an address route associated with a
message that originated on a foreign system.  When requested to deliver
a message to one of the addresses in the original message (eg: via the
read_mail reply request), the mail system will attempt to compute an
address route for the address.  If the address route computation fails,
the mail system will use the implicit route as the route for the
address.


List of printed representations:
   The printed representation of an address is the human readable form
   of that address.  It is used by the mail system when displaying a
   message or searching a message for a given character string.

   In the following printed representations, braces ({}) actually
   appear as part of the printed representation and brackets ([]) are
   used to denote optional parts of a printed representation.  The
   printed representations used by the mail system are:


Person_id.Project_id
   identifies either a user's default mailbox --
         >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx
   or a user's logbox --
         >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
   Any use of this printed representation to create an address will
   create an address referencing the specified user's default mailbox
   rather than his logbox to insure that other users will never attempt
   to send mail directly to his logbox.  (By default, only the user can
   add messages to his logbox).  However, when constructing a message
   for later delivery, the mail system will use the "{logbox}" format
   described below to represent the user's logbox.  This alternate
   representation allows the user to distinguish between his mailboxes
   in case he needs to change where his copy of the message will be
   delivered.


{logbox}
   appears only in the printed representation of messages being
   prepared for delivery and identifies the user's logbox --
         >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
   When the message is actually delivered, the printed representation
   of this address will be converted to the "Person_id.Project_id"
   format described above.


Person_id.Project_id (STR.sv)
   identifies a savebox belonging to the specified user.  STR is the
   entryname of the savebox excluding the "sv.mbx" suffix.  Any use of
   this printed representation to create an address will create an
   address referencing the specified user's default mailbox rather than
   his savebox to insure that other users will never attempt to send
   mail directly to his savebox.  (By default, only the user can add
   messages to one of his saveboxes).  However, when constructing a
   message for later delivery, the mail system will use the
   "{save path}" format described below to represent one of the user's
   saveboxes.  This alternate representation allows the user to
   distinguish between his mailboxes in case he needs to change where
   his copy of the message will be delivered.


{save path}
   appears only in the printed representation of a message being
   prepared for subsequent delivery and identifies a savebox.  Path is
   the absolute pathname of the savebox excluding the "sv.mbx" suffix.
   When the message is actually delivered, the printed representation
   of this address will be converted to the
   "Person_id.Project_id (STR.sv)" format described above.
{mbx path}
   identifies an arbitrary mailbox by pathname.  Path is the absolute
   pathname of the mailbox excluding the "mbx" suffix.
{forum path}
   identifies a Forum meeting by pathname.  Path is the absolute
   pathname of the meeting excluding the "control" suffix.


STR at FSystem [address-route]
   identifies an address on another computer system.  STR identifies
   the user (or group of users) to receive the message and is not
   interpreted in any way by the local system.  FSystem is the name of
   the foreign system where the address is located.  If the optional
   address-route is not present, FSystem will be the primary name of
   the foreign system as specified in the local system's network
   information table (NIT).  However, if an address-route is specified,
   the foreign system name does not have to be known to the local
   system.  See "Printed representation of an address route" below for
   further information.
STR
   identifies an entry in the system's mail table.  STR is the name of
   the mail table entry.  The display_mailing_address command may be
   used to display the actual address corresponding to this STR.


{list path}
   identifies a mailing list by pathname.  Path is the absolute
   pathname of the mailing list segment or archive component excluding
   the "mls" suffix.
STR: [ADDRs];
   identifies a named group address.  STR is the name of the group.  If
   present, ADDRs are the printed representations of the addresses
   which comprise the group and are separated by commas.
{invalid STR}
   identifies and invalid address.  STR is the text of the invalid
   address as it appeared in the original message or address list.


Printed representation of an address name:
When present, the address name is placed before the printed
representation of the address which is then enclosed in angle brackets
("<" and ">").

For example:
     Site Administrators <{list >udd>ssa>SiteSAs}>
     Gary M. Palter <Palter.Multics>


Printed representation of an address comment:
When present, the address comment is enclosed in parentheses and is
placed after the printed representation of the address.

For example:
     Palter.Multics (Gary M. Palter)
     Gary M. Palter <Palter.<Multics (Mail system maintainer)>


Printed representation of an address route:
   The printed representation of an address route is:

[via RelayN ...] via Relay1
   where Relay1 is the name of a foreign system in the local system's
   network information table (NIT) and the remaining names, if any,
   need not appear in the NIT.  Mail directed to an address with this
   address route will be forwarded to the system identified as Relay1.
   From there, it will be forwarded to the system identified as Relay2,
   etc. until it reaches the system identified as RelayN where it will
   be delivered to the system on which the foreign address actually
   resides.

For example, the printed representation of a foreign address with an
address route would be:
     GMP at EECS.MIT via MC via MIT-MULTICS.ARPA


Special characters in printed representations:
If a STR, Person_id.Project_id, FSystem, or RelayI in one of the above
printed represetnations contains any commas, colons, semi-colons,
parentheses, angle brackets (<>), braces ({}), quotes ("), commercial
at-signs (@), or whitespace other than single sequences of a space, it
must be quoted to avoid ambiguity with other printed representations.
Such a string is quoted by surrounding it with quotes and then doubling
any quotes found within the string.

For example, the string
     Richard "Rick" Kovalcik, Jr.

would be quoted as
     "Richard ""Rick"" Kovalcik, Jr."


If a pathname in one of the above printed representations contains any
parentheses, braces ({}), quotes ("), or whitespace other than single
sequences of a space, it must be quoted as described above in order to
avoid ambiguity.

If the text of a comment contains any parentheses, quotes ("), or
whitespace other than single sequences of a space, it must be quoted as
described above in order to avoid ambiguity.


List of control argument representations:
   The control argument representation of an address is the sequence of
   command/request line arguments and control arguments recognized by
   the mail system in order to allow a user to specify one or more mail
   system addresses on a command/request line.

   The control argument sequences recognized by the mail system are:

-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.  See "Notes on the -user address control argument" below
   for more information.
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to:
         -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx


-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix "sv.mbx" is added if
   necessary.
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix "mbx" is added if
   necessary.
-meeting path, -mtg path
   specifies the pathname of a Forum meeting.  The suffix "control" is
   added if necessary.  If the pathname given is just an entryname (ie:
   no "<" or ">" characters appear in the pathname), the "forum" search
   path is used to find the meeting.
STR -at FSystem {-via RelayN ... -via Relay1}
   specifies an address on another computer system.  See "Notes on
   the foreign address control argument representation" below for more
   information.


-mailing_list path, -mls path
   specifies the pathname of a mailing list.  The suffix mls is added if
   necessary.  The archive component pathname convention is accepted.
   For more information, type:
         help mailing_lists.gi
STR
   is any non-control argument interpreted by the mail system.  If STR
   contains either "<" or ">", it is interpreted as:
         -mailbox STR
   otherwise, it is interpreted as:
         -user STR


-name STR, -nm STR
   must appear immediately following one of the above forms of an address
   and specifies the name of the address.  An address name is usually the
   full name of the person who receives mail at that address or, for
   mailing lists, a description of the addresses comprising the mailing
   list (eg: Site Administrators).
-comment STR, -com STR
   must appear immediately following one of the above forms of an address
   and specifies a comment to be associated with that address.  This
   control argument is considered obsolete.


Notes on the -user address control argument:
As listed above, the "-user STR" address is used to specify either a
user's default mailbox of an entry in the system mail table.  For more
information on the mail table, type:
     help mail_table.gi


If the above STR contains exactly one period and no whitespace, it is
interpreted as a User_id which specifies a user's default mailbox;
otherwise, it is interpreted as the name of an entry in the mail table.

For example,
     -user Sibert.SiteSA
is interpreted as a User_id which identifies a default mailbox.  On the
other hand,
     -user "Gary M. Palter"
     -user J.C.Snead
are both interpreted as the names of entries in the mail table; the
first because it contains whitespace and the second because it contains
more than one period.


When interpreted as a User_id, the STR may not contain any angle
brackets (<>) and must have the form Person_id.Project_id where
Person_id may not exceed 28 characters in length and Project_id may not
exceed 32 characters in length.  In this case, "-user STR" is
equivalent to the address
     -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx

When interpreted as the name of a mail table entry, STR may not contain
any commas, colons, semi-colons, backslashes (\), parentheses, angle
brackets (<>), braces ({}), quotes ("), commercial at-signs (@), or
whitespace other than spaces.  The query of the mail table is performed
in a case insensitive manner.  The display_mailing_address command may
be used to determine the actual address corresponding to the STR.


Notes on the foreign address control argument representation:
As listed above, "STR -at FSystem..." specifies an address on another
computer system.

STR identifies the user (or group of users) to receive the message and
is not interpreted in any way by the local system.

FSystem is the name of the foreign system where the address is located.
If the optional -via control arguments are not present, FSystem must be
one of the names of a foreign system in the local system's network
information table (NIT).  However, if the -via control arguments are
specified, the foreign system name does not need to be known to the
local system.


If the -via control arguments are specified, they identify an explicit
route to be used to reach the foreign system.  In this case, Relay1
must be one of the names of a foreign system in the local system's NIT.
Mail destined for this foreign address will be forwarded to the system
identified as Relay1.  From there, it will be forwarded to the system
identified as Relay2, etc. until it reaches the system identified as
RelayN where it will be delivered to the system on which the foreign
address actually resides.

When the NIT is queried for either FSystem or Relay1, the query will be
performed in a case insensitive manner.


For example, the address

      GMP -at OZ -via MC -via mit-multics

identifies the address "GMP" on a system named "OZ".  In order to send
mail to this address, it will be relayed from the local system to the
system known as "mit-multics" which must be a system listed in the
local NIT.  "Mit-multics" will then forward the message to a system
named "MC" which will actually deliver the message to its final
destination.
