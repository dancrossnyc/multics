:Entry: meter_gate_: 02/20/85  meter_gate_


Function:
returns data about specific gate entries to the caller.


Syntax:
declare meter_gate_ entry (char(*), ptr fixed bin(35));
call meter_gate_ (gate_name, array_ptr, code);


Arguments:
gate_name
   is the name of the gate whose entries are to be metered.  (Input)
array_ptr
   is a pointer to an array described in "Notes" below.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Structure:
The second argument to meter_gate_ is a pointer to an array of entry
names to be metered.  This array has the following format:
   dcl 1 arg_array         aligned based (array_ptr),
         2 num_ents        fixed bin,
         2 info            (0 refer (arg_array.num_ents)),
           3 name          char(32),
           3 calls         fixed bin,
           3 page_waits    fixed bin,
           3 time fixed    bin(71);


   Structure elements:
   num_ents
      is the number of entries in the array info.
   name
      is the entryname.
   calls
      is the number of calls to that entry.
   page_waits
      is the number of page waits by that entry.
   time
      is the CPU time in (microseconds) used by that entry.
