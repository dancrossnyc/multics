03/14/85  syn_output, so

Syntax as a command:  so target_sw {-control_arg}


Function: directs output I/O switches to another already-open I/O
switch.  The effects of this command can be stacked.


Arguments:
target_sw
   is the name of an open I/O switch to which output is to be
   redirected.  It must be open for stream_output, stream_input_output,
   or IOS (the older version of the I/O system) compatibility.


Control arguments:
-source_switch STR, -ssw STR
   specifies the name of an I/O switch to be redirected.  (Default:
   user_output)


Notes: Each command invocation of syn_output stacks up another
attachment for each of the specified switches.

To avoid getting ready messages in the output file, the syn_output and
revert_output commands should appear on the same command line.

See the file_output, revert_output, and terminal_output commands.
