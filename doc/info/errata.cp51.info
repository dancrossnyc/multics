     get_editor_key_bindings
         returns a pointer to the line_editor_key_binding

         prints out the pathname of each editor routine, listing
         only the names of builtin requests in capital letters,
         with the word "builtin" in parentheses.  This control
         order prints or returns current information about the

         2 key_binding_info_ptr                ptr;


Page 7-23; before the description of 'key_binding_info_ptr' add
     the following.

     mbz
