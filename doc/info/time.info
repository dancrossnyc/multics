02/27/85  time

Syntax as a command:  time {time_string} {-control-arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [time {time_string} {-control-arg}]


Function: returns a five-character time of day of the form "HH:MM",
e.g., "16:15".  The format string to produce this is "^Hd:^MH".


Arguments:
time_string
   indicates the time about which information is desired.  If you
   supply no time_string, the current time is used.  The time string is
   concatenated to form a single argument even if it contains spaces;
   you need not quote it.  (See time_strings.gi for a description of
   valid time_string values.)


Control arguments:
-zone STR
   STR specifies the zone that is to be used to express the result.
   (Default: the process default)


Notes: Use the print_time_defaults command to display the default
zone.  Use the display_time_info command to display a list of all
acceptable zone values.

Due to exec_coms, etc., that have been built around the expected
date_time format, this command does not honor the process date_time
format (set by set_time_default).  You are encouraged to use "clock
time" in place of time to get the proper default handling.
