Syntax as a command:  io operation switchname {args}


Syntax as an active function:  [io operation switchname {args}]


Function: performs diverse operations on specified I/O switches and
returns a result.


Arguments:
operation
   designates the operation to be performed.  See "List of operations"
   below.  For a detailed description of each operation, type
   "help io_call.OPERATION", where OPERATION is the name of the
   specific operation.
switchname
   is the name of the I/O switch through which the operation is
   performed.  (In the next two sections SW means switchname.)
args
   can be one or more arguments, depending on the particular operation
   to be performed.


List of operations:

:Info: io_call.attach: io.attach:
04/02/85  io_call attach operation

Syntax as a command:  io attach switchname attach_description


Function: attaches the I/O switch using the designated I/O module.
If a control block for the I/O switch does not already exist, one is
created.


Arguments:
attach_description
   is the concatenation of modulename and args separated by blanks.
   It must conform to the requirements of the I/O module.  If the I/O
   modulename is specified by a pathname, it is initiated with a
   reference name equal to the entryname.  If the entryname or
   reference name does not contain a dollar sign, the attachment is
   made by calling modulename$modulenameattach.  If you supply a $,
   the entry point specified is called.  (See "Entry Point Names" in
   the Programmer's Reference Manual.)


:Info: io_call.attach_desc: io.attach_desc:
04/02/85  io_call attach_desc operation

Syntax as a command:  io attach_desc switchname


Syntax as an active function:
   [io attach_desc switchname {-control_arg}]


Function: prints or returns the attach description of the switch,
quoted unless you give -no_quote.


Control arguments:
-no_quote, -nq
   does not enclose the returned data in quotes.


:Info: io_call.attached: io.attached:
05/02/85  io_call attached operation

Syntax as a command:  io attached switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io attached switchname]


Function: prints or returns true if the switch is attached, false
otherwise.


:Info: io_call.close: io.close:
04/02/85  io_call close operation

Syntax as a command:  io close switchname


Function: closes the I/O switch.


:Info: io_call.close_file: io.close_file:
04/02/85  io_call close_file operation

Syntax as a command:  io close_file switchname {args}


Function: closes the I/O switch with the specified description.  The
close_file description is the concatenation of all args separated by
blanks.  It must conform to the requirements of the I/O module.


Arguments:
args
   can be one or more arguments, depending on what is permitted by the
   particular I/O module.


:Info: io_call.closed: io.closed:
04/02/85  io_call closed operation

Syntax as a command:  io closed switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io closed switchname]


Function: prints or returns true if the switch is closed, false
otherwise.


:Info: io_call.control: io.control:
04/02/85  io_call control operation

Syntax as a command:  io control switchname order {args}


Syntax as an active function:  [io control switchname order {args}]


Function: applies only when the I/O switch is attached via an I/O
module that supports the control I/O operation.  The exact format of
the command line depends on the order being issued and the I/O module
being used.  For more details see "Control Operations from Command
Level" in the appropriate I/O module.  If the I/O module supports the
control operation and the paragraph just referenced does not appear,
assume that only control orders that do not require an info_structure
can be performed with the io_call command.  This is true because this
command/active function uses a null info_ptr.  (See the iox_$control
entry point in the Subroutines manual and "Performing Control
Operations from Command Level" and the I/O module description in the
Programmer's Reference Manual.)

The active function returns a value that depends on the I/O module and
the order specified.


Arguments:
order
   is one of the orders accepted by the I/O module used in the
   attachment of the I/O switch.
args
   are additional arguments dependent upon the order being issued and
   the I/O module being used.


:Info: io_call.delete_record: io.delete_record: io_call.delete: io.delete:
04/02/85  io_call delete_record operation

Syntax as a command:  io delete switchname


Function: deletes the current record in the file to which the I/O
switch is attached.  The current record is determined as in
rewrite_record.


:Info: io_call.destroy_iocb: io.destroy_iocb:
04/02/85  io_call destroy_iocb operation

Syntax as a command:  io destroy_iocb switchname


Function: destroys the I/O switch by deleting its control block.  Be
sure the switch is detached before using this command.  Any pointers
to the I/O switch become invalid.


:Info: io_call.detach: io.detach:
04/02/85  io_call detach operation

Syntax as a command:  io detach switchname {args}


Function: detaches the I/O switch with the specified description.  The
detach description is the concatenation of all args separated by
blanks.  It must conform to the requirements of the I/O module.


Arguments:
args
   can be one or more arguments, depending on what is permitted by the
   particular I/O module.


Notes: If there are no arguments after switchname, this request is
synonymous with the detach_iocb request.  This means that if you
supply no detach description on the command line, detach acts
essentially as a short name for detach_iocb.


:Info: io_call.detach_iocb: io.detach_iocb:
04/02/85  io_call detach_iocb operation

Syntax as a command:  io detach_iocb switchname


Function: detaches the I/O switch.


:Info: io_call.detached: io.detached:
04/04/85  io_call detached operation

Syntax as a command:  io detached switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io detached switchname]


Function: prints or returns true if the switch is detached, false
otherwise.


:Info: io_call.find_iocb: io.find_iocb:
04/02/85  io_call find_iocb operation

Syntax as a command:  io find_iocb switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io find_iocb switchname]


Function: prints or returns the location of the control block for the
I/O switch.  If it does not already exist, the control block is
created.


:Info: io_call.get_chars: io.get_chars:
08/06/86  io_call get_chars operation

Syntax as a command:  io get_chars switchname {N} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
   [io get_chars switchname {N} {-control_args}]


Function: reads the next N characters from the file or device to which
the I/O switch is attached.


Arguments:
N
   is a decimal number greater than zero specifying the number of
   characters to read.


Control arguments:
-allow_newline, -alnl
   does not add to nor delete from the end of the line any newline
   character.  (Default, when you select -segment)
-append_newline, -apnl
   adds a newline character to the end of the line if one is not
   present.  (Default, when you choose no -segment)
-lines
   specifies that the offset, if given, is measured in lines rather
   than in characters.  This control argument has meaning only if you
   also supply -segment; you can't use it with the active function.


-no_quote, -nq
   returns the data unquoted.  (Default for active function only)
-remove_newline, -rmnl
   deletes the newline character, if present, from the end of the
   line.  (Default for active function)


-segment path {offset}, -sm path {offset}
   specifies that the data read from the I/O switch is to be stored in
   the segment given by path.  You can optionally describe the location
   at which to begin writing in path with the offset parameter.  This
   is normally specified as a character offset (i.e., the number of
   characters to skip over before storing the new data in the segment).
   For example, an offset of 0 causes the new data to overwrite the
   entire file.  When you also give -lines, then offset is a line
   offset (i.e., the number of lines to skip over before storing the
   new data in the segment).  For example, an offset of 1 line begins
   storing data at the second line of the file.  If you omit offset,
   new data is appended to the end of the segment.  You can't use this
   control argument with the active function.


Notes: The disposition of the characters read is the same as the one
described under the get_line operation; that is, they are written upon
user_output if you specify no -segment or stored in a segment if you
give -segment.  As an active function, returns the data read as a
quoted string, unless you use -no_quote.  A trailing newline character
is deleted.  If you don't supply the maximum number of characters N,
the maximum segment size is assumed.


:Info: io_call.get_line: io.get_line:
08/06/86  io_call get_line operation

Syntax as a command:  io get_line switchname {N} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
   [io get_line switchname {N} {-control_args}]


Function: reads the next line from the file or device to which the I/O
switch is attached.  If you give N and the line is longer than N, then
only the first N characters are read.  The active function returns the
data read as a quoted string, unless you supply -no_quote.  A trailing
newline character is deleted.  If you don't supply the maximum number
of characters N, the maximum segment size is assumed.


Arguments:
N
   is a decimal number greater than zero specifying the maximum number
   of characters to be read.


Control arguments:
-allow_newline, -alnl
   does not add to nor delete from the end of the line any newline
   character.  (Default, when you select -segment)
-append_newline, -apnl
   adds a newline character to the end of the line if one is not
   present.  (Default, when you choose no -segment)
-lines
   specifies that the offset, if given, is measured in lines rather
   than in characters.  This control argument has meaning only if you
   also supply -segment; you can't use it with the active function.


-no_quote, -nq
   returns the data unquoted.  (Default for active function only)
-remove_newline, -rmnl
   deletes the newline character, if present, from the end of the
   line.  (Default for active function)


-segment path {offset}, -sm path {offset}
   specifies that the data read from the I/O switch is to be stored in
   the segment given by path.  You can optionally describe the location
   at which to begin writing in path with the offset parameter.  This
   is normally specified as a character offset (i.e., the number of
   characters to skip over before storing the new data in the segment).
   For example, an offset of 0 causes the new data to overwrite the
   entire file.  When you also give -lines, then offset is a line
   offset (i.e., the number of lines to skip over before storing the
   new data in the segment).  For example, an offset of 1 line begins
   storing data at the second line of the file.  If you omit offset,
   new data is appended to the end of the segment.  You can't use this
   control argument with the active function.


Notes: If you select no -segment, the line read is written onto the
I/O switch user_output, with a newline character appended if one is
not present and if you have supplied neither allow_newline nor
-remove_newline.

If you give -segment, the line is stored in the segment specified by
path; if this segment does not exist, it is created.  If you use
offset, the line is stored at that position relative to the start of
the segment; this is normally measured in characters, unless you have
selected -lines.  If you omit offset, the line is appended to the end
of the segment.  The bit count of the segment is always updated to a
point beyond the newly added data.  If the segment contains a trailing
newline and you haven't chosen -remove_newline, that newline remains;
if the segment does not contain a trailing newline and you haven't
specified -append_newline, no newline is appended.


:Info: io_call.io_module: io.io_module:
04/02/85  io_call io_module operation

Syntax as a command:  io io_module switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io io_module switchname]


Function: prints or returns the name of the I/O module through which
the switch is attached.


:Info: io_call.look_iocb: io.look_iocb:
04/02/85  io_call look_iocb operation

Syntax as a command:  io look_iocb switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io look_iocb switchname]


Function: prints, on user_output, the location of the control block
for the I/O switch; if this switch does not exist, an error is
printed.  The active function returns true if the specified iocb
exists, false otherwise.


:Info: io_call.modes: io.modes:
04/02/85  io_call modes operation

Syntax as a command:  io modes switchname {string} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [io modes switchname {string}]


Function: sets only new modes specified in string and then prints the
old modes on user_output; applies only when the I/O switch is attached
via an I/O module that supports modes.  The active function performs
the specified modes operation and returns the old modes.


Arguments:
string
   is a sequence of modes separated by commas.  The string must not
   contain blanks.  See the description of the I/O module attached
   to the switch for a list of acceptable modes.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of the old modes.


Notes: If the switch name is user_i/o, the command refers to the modes
controlling your terminal.


:Info: io_call.move_attach: io.move_attach:
04/02/85  io_call move_attach operation

Syntax as a command:  io move_attach switchname switchname2


Function: moves the attachment of the first I/O switch (switchname) to
the second I/O switch (switchname2).  The original I/O switch is left
detached.


Arguments:
switchname2
   is the name of a second I/O switch.


:Info: io_call.open: io.open:

:Info: io_call.open_desc: io.open_desc:
04/02/85  io_call open_desc operation

Syntax as a command:  io open_desc switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io open_desc switchname {-no_quote}]


Function: prints or returns the current open description
(stream_input, etc.), quoted.


:Info: io_call.open_file: io.open_file:
04/02/85  io_call open_file operation

Syntax as a command:  io open_file switchname mode {args}


Function: open the I/O switch with the specified opening mode and
description.  The open_file description is the concatenation of all
args separated by blanks.  It must conform to the requirements of the
I/O module.


Arguments:
args
   can be one or more arguments, depending on what is permitted by the
   particular I/O module.


List of modes:
   The following opening modes are accepted:
direct_input, di
direct_output, do
direct_update, du
keyed_sequential_input, ksqi
keyed_sequential_output, ksqo
keyed_sequential_update, ksqu
sequential_input, sqi
sequential_output, sqo
sequential_input_output, sqio

:Info: io_call.opened: io.opened:
04/02/85  io_call opened operation

Syntax as a command:  io opened switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io opened switchname]


Function: prints or returns true if the switch is open, false
otherwise.


:Info: io_call.position: io.position:
04/02/85  io_call position operation

Syntax as a command:  io position switchname type


Syntax as an active function:  [io position switchname type]


Function: positions the file to which the I/O switch is attached.


List of types:
bof
   sets position to beginning of file.
eof
   sets position to end of file.
forward N, fwd N, f N
   sets position forward N records or lines (same as reverse -N).
reverse N, rev N, r N
   sets position back N records (same as forward -N records).  Any
   other numeric argument or pair of numeric arguments can be
   specified, but its function depends on the I/O module being used
   and cannot be implemented for all I/O modules.


Notes: If type is bof, the file is positioned to its beginning, so
that the next record is the first record (structured files) or the
next byte is the first byte (unstructured files).  If type is eof, the
file is positioned to its end; the next record (or next byte) is at
the end-of-file position.  If type is forward or reverse, the file is
positioned forwards or backwards over records (structured files) or
lines (unstructured files).  The number of records or lines skipped is
determined by the absolute value of N.  The active function returns
true if it succeed, false otherwise.

In the case of unstructured files, the next-byte position after the
operation is at a byte immediately following a newline character (or
at the first byte in the file or at the end of the file).  The number
of newline characters moved over is the absolute value of N.

If the I/O switch is attached to a device, you are only allowed
forward skips; this discards the next N lines input from the device.


:Info: io_call.print_iocb: io.print_iocb:
04/02/85  io_call print_iocb operation

Syntax as a command:  io print_iocb switchname


Function: prints, on user_output, all the data in the control block
for the I/O switch, including all pointers and entry variables.


:Info: io_call.put_chars: io.put_chars:
08/06/86  io_call put_chars operation

Syntax as a command:  io put_chars switchname {string} {-control_args}


Function: outputs a character string or an entire segment to a
specified I/O switch.


Arguments:
string
   can be any character string.


Control arguments:
-allow_newline, -alnl
   does not add to nor delete from the end of the line any newline
   character.
-append_newline, -apnl
   adds a newline character to the end of the line if one is not
   present.  (Default)
-lines
   specifies that the offset and length operands of -segment are
   measured in lines rather than in characters.  This control argument
   has meaning only if you also supply -segment.
-remove_newline, -rmnl
   does not append a newline character to the end of the output string
   or segment even if one is not present at the end.


-segment path {{offset} length}, -sm path {{offset} length}
   specifies that the data for the output operation is to be found in
   the segment specified by path.  You can optionally describe the
   location and length of the data with offset and length parameters.
   These are normally specified as a character offset (i.e., 0
   identifies the first character of the segment) and character length.
   When you also give -lines, they are specified as a line offset and
   line count.  If you give no offset, 0 is assumed.  If you give no
   length and offset, the entire segment is used.
-string STR, -str STR
   specifies an output string that can have a leading hyphen.


Notes: The string argument and -segment are mutually exclusive.  If
you supply a string, the contents of the string are output to the I/O
switch.  If you supply -segment, the data is taken from the segment
specified by path, at the offset and length given.

If the I/O switch is attached to a device, io_call transmits the
characters from the string or the segment to the device.  If the I/O
switch is attached to an unstructured file, the data is added to the
end of the file.


:Info: io_call.read_key: io.read_key:
04/02/85  io_call read_key operation

Syntax as a command:  io read_key switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io read_key switchname {-control_arg}]


Function: prints, on user_output, the key and record length of the
next record in the indexed file to which the I/O switch is attached.
The file's position is not changed.  The active function returns the
value of the key, quoted unless you select -no_quote.


Control arguments:
-no_quote, -nq
   does not enclose the returned data in quotes.  Data containing
   spaces is quoted by default.


:Info: io_call.read_length: io.read_length:
04/02/85  io_call read_length operation

Syntax as a command:  io read_length switchname


Syntax as an active function:  [io read_length switchname]


Function: prints, on user_output, the length of the next record in the
structured file to which the I/O switch is attached.  The file's
position is not changed.  The active function returns the length of
the next record, in bytes.


:Info: io_call.read_record: io.read_record: io_call.read: io.read:
08/06/86  io_call read_record operation

Syntax as a command:  io read switchname {N} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [io read switchname {N} {-control_args}]


Function: reads the next record from the file to which the I/O switch
is attached into a buffer of length N.


Arguments:
N
   is a decimal integer greater than zero specifying the size of the
   buffer to use.


Control arguments:
-allow_newline, -alnl
   does not add to nor delete from the end of the line any character.
   (Default for command)
-append_newline, -apnl
   adds a newline character to the end of the line if one is not
   present.
-lines
   specifies that the offset, if given, is measured in lines rather
   than in characters.  This control argument has meaning only if you
   also supply -segment; you can't use it with the active function.


-no_quote, -nq
   returns the data unquoted.  Active function usage only.
-remove_newline
   deletes the newline character, if present, from the end of the
   line.  (Default for active function)


-segment path {offset}, -sm path {offset}
   specifies that the data read from the I/O switch is to be stored in
   the segment given by path.  You can optionally describe the location
   at which to begin writing in path with the offset parameter.  This
   is normally specified as a character offset (i.e., the number of
   characters to skip over before storing the new data in the segment).
   For example, an offset of 0 causes the new data to overwrite the
   entire file.  When you also give -lines, then offset is a line
   offset (i.e., the number of lines to skip over before storing the
   new data in the segment).  For example, an offset of 1 line begins
   storing data at the second line of the file.  If you omit offset,
   new data is appended to the end of the segment.  You can't use this
   control argument with the active function.


Notes: If you don't supply -segment, the record (or the part of it
that fits into the buffer) is printed on user_output.  If you give
-segment, the record is stored in a segment as explained under the
get_chars operation.

The active function returns the data read as a quoted string, unless
you select -no_quote.  A trailing newline character is deleted.  If
you don't give the maximum number of characters N, the maximum segment
size is assumed.


:Info: io_call.rewrite_record: io.rewrite_record: io_call.rewrite: io.rewrite:
08/06/86  io_call rewrite_record operation

Syntax as a command:  io rewrite switchname {string} {-control_args}


Function: replaces the current record in the file to which the I/O
switch is attached.


Arguments:
string
   is any character string.


Control arguments:
-allow_newline, -alnl
   does not add to nor delete from the end of the line any newline
   character.  (Default, when you select -segment)
-append_newline, -apnl
   adds a newline character to the end of the line if one is not
   present.
-lines
   specifies that the offset and length operands of -segment are
   measured in lines rather than in characters.  This control argument
   has meaning only if you also supply -segment.
-no_quote, -nq
   returns the data unquoted.  Active function usage only.


-remove_newline, -rmnl
   deletes the newline character, if present, from the end of the
   line.  (Default if you give no -segment)
-segment path {{offset} length}, -sm path {{offset} length}
   specifies that the data for the output operation is to be found in
   the segment specified by path.  You can optionally describe the
   location and length of the data with offset and length parameters.
   These are normally specified as a character offset (i.e., 0
   identifies the first character of the segment) and character length.
   When you also give -lines, they are specified as a line offset and
   line count.  If you give no offset, 0 is assumed.  If you give no
   length and offset, the entire segment is used.
-string STR, -str STR
   specifies an output string that can have a leading hyphen.


Notes: The string argument and -segment are mutually exclusive.  If
you supply a string, the contents of the string are output to the I/O
switch.  If you supply -segment, the data is taken from the segment
specified by path, at the offset and length given.

The current record must have been defined by a preceding read_record,
seek_key, or position operation as follows:
read_record
   the current record is the last record read.
seek_key
   the current record is the record with the specified key.
position
   the current record is the one preceding the record to which the file
   was positioned.


:Info: io_call.seek_key: io.seek_key:
04/02/85  io_call seek_key operation

Syntax as a command:  io seek_key switchname key


Syntax as an active function:  [io seek_key switchname key]


Function: positions the indexed file to which the I/O switch is
attached to the record with the given key.  The record's length is
printed on user_output.  Trailing blanks in the key are ignored.  The
active function returns true if the key exists, false otherwise.


Arguments:
key
   is a string of no more than 256 ASCII characters.  The null string
   ("") is allowed as a key.


Notes: If the file does not contain a record with the specified key,
it becomes the key for insertion.  A following write_record operation
adds a record with this key.


:Info: io_call.test_mode: io.test_mode:
04/02/85  io_call test_mode operation

Syntax as a command:  io test_mode switchname mode


Syntax as an active function:  [io test_mode switchname mode]


Function: performs a modes operation and prints or returns true if
mode appears in the mode string, false if ^mode appears.


:Info: io_call.valid_mode: io.valid_mode:
04/02/85  io_call valid_mode operation

Syntax as a command:  io valid_mode switchname mode


Syntax as an active function:  [io valid_mode switchname mode]


Function: performs a modes operation and prints or returns true if
either mode or ^mode appears in the mode string, false otherwise.


:Info: io_call.valid_op: io.valid_op:
04/02/85  io_call valid_op operation

Syntax as a command:  io valid_op switchname operation


Syntax as an active function:  [io valid_op switchname operation]

:Info: io_call.write_record: io.write_record: io_call.write: io.write:
08/06/86  io_call write_record operation

Syntax as a command:  io write switchname {string} {-control_args}


Function: adds a record to the file to which the I/O switch is
attached.  If the string parameter is specified, the record is equal to
the string.  If the -segment control argument is specified, the record
is extracted from the segment as described under the put_chars
operation.  If the file is a sequential file, the record is added at
the end of the file.  If the file is an indexed file, the record's key
must have been defined by a preceding seek_key operation.


Arguments:
string
   is any character string.


Control arguments:
-allow_newline, -alnl
   does not add to nor delete from the end of the line any newline
   character.  (Default, when you select -segment)
-append_newline, -apnl
   adds a newline character to the end of the line if one is not
   present.
-lines
   specifies that the offset and length operands of -segment are
   measured in lines rather than in characters.  This control argument
   has meaning only if you also supply -segment.
-no_quote, -nq
   returns the data unquoted.  (Active function usage only)


-remove_newline, -rmnl
   deletes the newline character, if present, from the end of the
   line.  (Default if you give no -segment)
-segment path {{offset} length}, -sm path {{offset} length}
   specifies that the data for the output operation is to be found in
   the segment specified by path.  You can optionally describe the
   location and length of the data with offset and length parameters.
   These are normally specified as a character offset (i.e., 0
   identifies the first character of the segment) and character length.
   When you also give -lines, they are specified as a line offset and
   line count.  If you give no offset, 0 is assumed.  If you give no
   length and offset, the entire segment is used.
-string STR, -str STR
   specifies an output string that can have a leading hyphen.


Notes: The string argument and -segment are mutually exclusive.  If
you supply a string, the contents of the string are output to the I/O
switch.  If you supply -segment, the data is taken from the segment
specified by path, at the offset and length given.

If the file is sequential, the record is added at the end of the file.
If the file is indexed, the record's key must have been defined by a
preceding seek_key operation.
