03/18/85  video_utils_


This subroutine provides interfaces for activating and de-activating
the video system.


Entry points in video_utils_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry: turn_on_login_channel: 03/18/85 video_utils_$turn_on_login_channel


Function: This entry removes the existing attachment of the user's
terminal, replacing it with the video system.  When this entry returns
successfully, the switch user_terminal_ is attached through tc_io_ to
the user's terminal.  The switch user_ i/o is attached through
window_io_ to a window covering the entire screen.  invoked: vertsp,
can, erkl, esc, red, and ctl_char.  In addition, if ^pl is set on
video system invocation, ^more will be set in the video system.
Similarly, the settings of the current erase and kill characters are
copied when the video system is invoked.


Syntax:
declare video_utils_$turn_on_login_channel entry (fixed bin (35),
     char (*));
call video_utils_$turn_on_login_channel (code, reason);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard system error code.  (Output)
reason
   contains information about the error, if there is one.  (Output)
   (128 characters are enough to hold any message that may be returned
   in reason.)


Notes:  If the video system is already in service on the user's
terminal, the status code video_et_$wsys_invoked is returned, and the
value of reason is not defined.

If the activation of the video system fails, the original attachment of
the terminal (through tty_) is restored, and information is returned in
reason and code.

In particular, if the switch user_i/o is not currently attached through
tty_, the code video_et_$switch_not_attached_with_tty_ is returned.
This may indicate that the user has auditing or the graphic system in
place.  The message returned in reason advises the user to remove
graphics or auditing and try again.


:Entry: turn_off_login_channel: 03/18/85 video_utils_$turn_off_login_channel


Function: This entry reverses the actions of
video_utils_$turn_on_login_channel.  That is, it removes the window
attachment of user_i/o, detaches terminal control from the user's
terminal, and attaches user_i/o to the user's terminal via tty_.  The
settings of the following modes are copied when when the video system
is revoked: vertsp, can, erkl, esc, red, and ctl_char.  If ^more is
set while in the video system, ^pl mode will be set after revoking the
video system.  (For more details on modes, see the window_io_ I/O
module.) Similarly, the settings of the current erase and kill
characters are copied when the video system is revoked.  It is the
user's responsibility to detach any windows other than user_io before
calling this entry point


Syntax:
declare video_utils_$turn_off_login_channel entry (fixed bin (35));
call video_utils_$turn_off_login_channel (code);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard system error code.  (Output) It is nonzero if and only
   if the video system can not be removed from the user's terminal.
