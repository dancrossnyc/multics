03/31/83  branches, nonlinks

Syntax:  nonlinks star_names {-control_arg{s}}


Syntax as an active function:  [nonlinks star_names {-control_arg{s}}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of segments,
directories, and multisegment files that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_name
   is a star name to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.  The default is
   to return entrynames.
-chase
   will process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
-no_chase
   will not process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
   (Default)


Notes:  Only one name per branch is returned; i.e., if a branch has
more than one name that matches star_name, only the first match found
is returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by nonlinks is enclosed in
quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.

A synonym for nonlinks is nonlinks.
