Syntax:  ssp search_list {search_paths} {-control_arg}


Function:	 allows a user to replace the search paths contained in a
specified search list.


Arguments:
search_list
   is the name of a search list.  If this search list does not exist,
   it is created.  A warning message is printed if a search list is
   created and it is not system defined.
search_paths
   are search paths to be added to the specified search list.  The
   search paths are added in the order in which they are specified in
   the command line.  The search path can be an absolute or relative
   pathname or a keyword.  (For a list of acceptable keywords see
   add_search_paths in Commands and Active Functions, AG92.)  If no
   search paths are specified, then the specified search list is set
   as if it were being initialized for the first time in the user's
   process.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses a warning message for the creation of a search list not
   defined by the system.
-default, -df
   replaces the search list with its system-defined default.  No
   search_paths can be specified with this control argument.


Notes:  The specified search list is replaced by the specified search
paths.  It is an error to create a new empty search list.


For a complete list of the search facility commands, see the
add_search_paths command description in Commands and Active Functions,
AG92.
