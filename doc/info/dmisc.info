Syntax:  dmisc


Function: allows the accounting administrator to delete charges from
the miscfile for billing purposes.  For each transaction, the
Project_id and the number of the miscfile entry are required.  The
number of the miscfile entry is printed using the pmisc command.  Both
input items for a transaction can be put on the same line or they can
be supplied one at a time.  To exit from this command, type "x"
instead of a Project_id.  Charges and credits are made to the miscfile
using the charge and credit commands, respectively.

See MAM - Registration and Accounting (AS68) for more information.
