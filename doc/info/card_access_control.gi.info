11/19/85  Card Access Control

Authentication procedures are enforced for user submission of card
input.  You must have a registered card input password and have given
access to the submitting card input station.  (See also
card_input.gi.info.)

For you to submit a card deck for input to Multics, the following
conditions must be met:
  1. You must be registered for card input and have an assigned card
     input password set up by the system administrator or have been
     given permission to use the null password feature.
  2. A special access control segment must exist in your mailbox
     directory. Proper access must be set for the station in order for
     it to read card decks (see "Card input access control segment"
     below).


  3. You must have permission to use the card input station.  This is
     granted by the system administrator on the ACL of the station
     access control segment.

For remote job entry (RJE) jobs, the tag portion of the process group
ID of the absentee process (which is used in access control
calculations) is "p".  A system administrator or you can deny access
to RJE jobs with the ACL term:
   null *.*.p
or similar ACL terms, assuming that there does not exist a more
specific ACL term that gives access.


Card input registration and password: Each user usually must be given
a card input password by the system administrator to use any form of
card input on Multics.  The card input password defined should be
different from your interactive password.  You Person_id and password
are provided on control cards at the time the deck is submitted.

The user who submits card input must include a password card as the
second card of his deck.  It has the form
   ++PASSWORD xxxxxxxx
where xxxxxxxx is the user's registered card input password (1-8
characters).  The keypunch printer should be usually turned off when
punching the password.


If the Person_id given in the ++DATA or ++RJE card is not registered
appropriately, or if the password given on the password card is
incorrect, the input is not accepted.


Card input access control segment: The card input access control
segment allows you to control which stations can be used to read bulk
card input using your Person_id and Project_id; its pathname is
   >udd>Project_id>Person_id>card_input.acs

This segment must exist with an ACL containing read access to each
station that is permitted to submit bulk data input for you and
execute access for each station that is permitted to submit RJE jobs.
For example,
   re Station.*.*


You can use the ACL star convention as usual.  If your job lacks
access to the card input ACS, input is not accepted.  If this segment
does not exist or if the access is not as specified, card input is not
permitted.  Besides, you must have permission to use the station, with
the same type of access as defined above, granted by the system
administrator on the ACL of the station access control segment as
discussed below.  Remote terminal login is accepted only from remote
terminals that have a registered station ID and password.  The name of
each registered station and its password is stored in the person name
table.


Station access control segment: Each station has an access control
segment in >system_control_1>rcp> named station.acs.  The ACL of this
segment lists all users allowed to submit card input through the
station; you must have read access for bulk data input and execute
access for RJE.  For example,
   re Person_id.Project_id.*

You can use the ACL star convention as usual.  If your job lacks
access to the station ACS, the input is not accepted.


This check allows your site to specify that a certain station is
reserved for the use of a certain group of users.  The ACS can also be
used to ensure that certain stations are not used to submit card input
for privileged users, such as *.SysAdmin, who should never use the
facility for reasons of security.  If you are not on the ACS for a
station you wish to use, you should contact the system adminstrator to
obtain proper access.
