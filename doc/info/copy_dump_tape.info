01/11/87  copy_dump_tape


Syntax as a command:  copy_dump_tape -control_args


Function:  This command copies Multics storage system hierarchy dump
data from a set of input (master) tapes to a set of output (copy)
tapes.  Options allow comparing master and copy tapes after the copy
operation; selective copying based upon pathname specifications in a
selection file; and copying/comparing from or to a storage system file
containing an image of a set of dump tape, rather than tapes.


Control arguments:
-abort
   indicates that comparing of the master with the copy should stop
   when the first discrepancy is found.
-compare, -cmp
   indicates that master and copy should be compared after the copy is
   generated.  Any discrepancies are reported to the user.


-input_file IN_PATH, -if IN_PATH
   gives the pathname of a file containing an image of the backup dump
   tape.  This file must have been created by a prior invocation of
   copy_dump_tape.  It contains the master data to be copied.
-input_volume VOLNAMES, -ivol VOLNAMES
   gives a list of input tape volume names containing the master data
   to be copied.  The names are separated from one another by a blank.
   Up to 20 volume names can be given.  This control argument may be
   followed by the control arguments described below in "Control
   arguments for volume attributes".


-map {MAP_PATH}
   controls the generation and naming of a dump map.  If -map is given
   with a MAP_PATH, then a dump map listing the copied files is
   generated in that file.  A suffix of map is assumed if not supplied.
   If no MAP_PATH is given, the map is generated in a file in the
   working directory.  The file name is derived from other control
   arguments, as follows.  If -select SELECT_PATH is given, then the
   map file name is the final entryname from SELECT_PATH.  If -select
   is omitted but -ovol VOLNAME is given, then the map file is called
   VOLNAME.map.  If -of OUT_PATH is given, then the map file is the
   final entryname from OUT_PATH.  Otherwise, the map file name is a
   unique character string (returned by the unique_chars_ subroutine).


-maximize_devices, -maxdv
   indicates that all tape drives reserved by the process or assigned
   to the process are to be used equally (round-robin) when copying
   from or to tape, and that during comparison, tape volumes are to be
   mounted on a different tape drive than was used during copying.
   This helps detect tape failures caused by reading or writing on a
   poorly calibrated tape drive.
-no_abort, -nabort
   indicates that comparing master and copy should continue when errors
   are encountered, until 20 discrepancies are found.  This is the
   default.
-no_compare, -ncmp
   indicates that master and copy are not to be compared after the copy
   operation.  This is the default.


-no_map, -nmap
   indicates that no backup map of the copied data is to be produced.
   This is the default.
-no_maximze_devices, -nmaxdv
   allows RCP to select which tape drives to use when reading or
   writing tapes.  This is the default.
-no_select, -nslct
   indicates that all master data is to be copied and compared.  This
   is the default.
-no_trace, -ntrace
   prevents tracing information from being printed.  This is the
   default.


-output_discard, -od
   indicates that no output copy is to be generated.  This is useful in
   conjunction with -map to produce a map of the master data, or in
   conjunction with -trace for debugging purposes.
-output_file OUT_PATH, -of OUT_PATH
   gives the pathname of a copy file into which the master data is
   copied.
-output_volume VOLNAMES, -ovol VOLNAMES
   gives a list of output tape volume names.  The master data is copied
   onto this copy tape volume set.  The names are separated from one
   another by a blank.  Up to 20 volume names can be given.  This
   control argument may be followed by the control arguments described
   below in "Control arguments for volume attributes".


-select SELECT_PATH, -slct SELECT_PATH
   gives the pathname of a file similar to a standard backup_dump
   control file.  This file gives paths of master files to be selected
   for copying.  See "Notes on control file."
-trace {TYPE}
   controls printing of trace information while copying and comparing.
   This information is primarily used for debugging copy_dump_tape.
   See "List of trace types".


Control arguments for volume attributes:
   The following control arguments define attributes of tape volumes
   given in preceding -input_volume or -output_volume control argument.
-density DEN, -den DEN
   gives a tape density.  DEN may be 800, 1600 or 6250.  If given for
   input tapes, the tapes are mounted on a tape drive capable of
   reading density DEN.  However, the actual density at which the input
   tapes are written determines the density used for reading.  If given
   for output tapes, the tapes are written at density DEN.  The default
   density is 1600 BPI (bits per inch).
-track TK, -tk TK
   mounts tapes on a tape drive capable of handling tapes containing TK
   tracks.  TK may be 7 or 9.  The default track size is 9.


List of trace types:
   One of the following trace types may be given as operand with the
   -trace control argument.  These arguments control the type of trace
   information printed.  If any tracing is enabled, then attach
   descriptions are printed in addition to the segment information
   described below.
all, a
   during both copy and compare operations, trace master segments
   selected by paths in the -select file.
compare, cmp
   during the compare operation, trace master segments selected by
   paths in the -select file.  No segments are traced during the copy
   operation.


copy, cp
   during the copy operation, trace master segments selected by paths
   in the -select file.  No segments are traced during the compare
   operation.  This is the default if -trace is specified without a
   TYPE operand.
off
   turn off tracing.  This is equivalent to -no_trace.
rejects, reject, rej
   print master segments unmatched or rejected by paths in the -select
   file.


List of severity values:
   copy_dump_tape sets an external variable to indicate the success or
   failure of copy and compare operations.  This variable may be
   examined using the severity command/active function.  For example:

      &goto RESULT_&[severity copy_dump_tape]

   The following severity values can be returned.


0
   Both copy and compare operations completed successfully.
2
   The copy and compare operations completed successfully, but one or
   more paths given in the -select file were not matched by master
   segments.  These pathnames are listed in a message printed by
   copy_dump_tape.
3
   The copy operation completed successfully, but the compare operation
   found discrepancies between master and copy segments.
4
   Either copy or compare operations failed, due to fatal errors.
   These errors are listed in error messages printed by copy_dump_tape.


Notes:  Either -input_file or -input_volume must be given to specify
the source of master input data.  Either -output_discard, -output_file
or -output_volume must be given to specify the target for copied data.


Notes on control file:  The control file specified by -select is an
ASCII segment containing pathnames of entries (segments, MSFs, and
directory subtrees).  Each pathname must be given on a separate line.
Absolute pathnames must be given, with each entryname of the path being
a primary name (the first name of the entry).  Master entries matching
one of the paths are copied and compared.  Master entries which are
superior to one of the paths are also copied/compared.  If a path
identifies a directory, then master entries inferior to that directory
are copied/compared.  A pathname preceded by a circumflex (^) character
identifies entries which are NOT to be copied or compared, unless later
entries in the control file override the rejection.


For example--

   >library_dir_dir>hardcore
  ^>library_dir_dir>hardcore>info
   >library_dir_dir>hardcore>info>hardcore.header

selects all entries in the subtree below >library_dir_dir>hardcore,
except those in the info directory.  However, the hardcore.header entry
in the info directory is selected.
