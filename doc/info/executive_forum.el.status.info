Description

A disconnection occurred while xforum was building the meeting list.
After reconnecting and typing "start", the following error message was
displayed.

   xforum:  There is a window interrupt status pending for the specified
            window.  A fatal error has occurred while in the xforum_help_line_
            module.  Cannot update the help line.

Interruping Xforum while the startup message is still on the screen and
then "starting" can cause window status pending errors or fatal errors.

When opening a meeting check for other errors besides invalid meeting
and make sure that the error is handled correctly.  Incorrect handling
can cause an infinite loop.

Need a RQO handler when writting the spy data just incase the compiler
pool is full.
