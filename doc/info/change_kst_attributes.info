Syntax:  change_kst_attributes {-control_arg} target attributes


Function:  allows you to change selected per-process attributes of a
segment.


Arguments:
target
   specifies the segment whose known segment table (KST) attributes are
   to be changed.  Either a relative pathname or an octal segment
   number can be supplied.
attributes
   are per-process attributes of a segment.  See "List of attributes"
   below.


Control arguments:
-name, -nm
   is used only if the target is a relative pathname that looks like a
   segment number.


List of attributes:  One or more of the following must be given--
allow_deactivate
   if set, permits explicit deactivation of the segment.
allow_write
   if set, you are not prevented from writing into the segment or
   directory if you have permission to do so.
audit
   if set, enables auditing.
tms
   if set, date-time-modified is not updated on your user account.
tpd
   if set, pages of this object are not placed on the paging device on
   your account.
tus
   if set, date-time-used is not updated on your user account.


Notes on access required: This command requires access to the hphcs_
gate if the tms or tus attributes are to be set; otherwise, access to
the phcs_ gate is required.


Notes:  Because directories are activated when their segment numbers
are assigned, it is not possible to set meaningfully the tpd, tms, tus,
or allow_deactivate attributes for a directory.

If an attribute is preceded by the circumflex character (^), then the
attribute is reset; otherwise, the attribute is set.  Attributes not
mentioned are unaffected.
