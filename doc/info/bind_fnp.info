01/30/84  bind_fnp

Syntax:  bind_fnp pathname {-control_args}


Function:  produces a core image segment that can be loaded into the
FNP.  It uses two control segments:  a bindfile, which specifies the
configuration that the FNP will support, the names and ordering of the
object segments included in the core image, and the size of certain
software tables; and an optional search rules segment, which specifies
which directories are searched to find the object segments.


Arguments:
pathname
   specifies the pathname of the bindfile.  If pathname does not have a
   suffix of bind_fnp, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-cross_ref, -cref
   adds a symbol cross reference to the listing segment.  If -cross_ref
   is specified, the listing is generated regardless of whether -list
   is also specified.
-list, -ls
   produces a listing segment whose name is derived from the name of
   the bindfile, with the suffix changed to list.  The listing segment
   is a record of the binding.  It contains a copy of the bindfile, a
   load map, and any error messages generated during binding.


-search, -se
   indicates that the user wishes to specify the rules used to search
   for Multics Communications System object segments being bound into
   the core image.  If given, there must be a segment in the working
   directory containing an ASCII list of relative pathnames of
   directories to be searched in the order in which the search is
   desired.  By default, the working directory is searched.  This
   segment must have the same entryname as the bindfile, but with the
   suffix changed to search.
-version STR
   assigns a version of STR to the core image.  The maximum length of
   STR is four characters.  If this control argument is given, it
   overrides the version keyword specified in the bindfile.


Notes:  A default bindfile is supplied with the system.  In general,
the only fields that a site administrator would change are:  hsla,
lsla, version, order, and the size keyword for the trace module.

When creating a new FNP core image, object segments that are unchanged
must be extracted from the object archive (see the MPM Commands) into a
directory in the search list before executing the bind_fnp command.

The syntax of the bindfile is described in Section 6 of the MAM --
Communications Manual, Order No.  CC75.
