07/16/84  find_symbols, fsb

Syntax as a command:  fsb {expansions} {-control_args}


Function:  The find_symbols command finds and lists all of the symbols
associated with specified expansions contained in the current symbol
dictionary.  One, several, or all expansions may be listed.


Arguments:
expansions
   are optional arguments that specify expansions to find and list.  If
   an expansion is represented by more than one symbol, all of its
   symbols are found and listed.  If any given expansion is not found,
   a message is printed stating that the expansion is not defined.  If
   no expansions are specified, all expansions in the current symbol
   dictionary are listed.  The expansions are listed in order according
   to ASCII collating sequence.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   specifies that for each symbol listed, its expansion string with
   suffixing is listed for each suffix enabled for that symbol.
-option, -op
   specifies that all option information for the current symbol
   dictionary is to be listed (see the option_symbols command for a
   complete description of option information).  If this is the only
   control argument specified, only the option information is listed.
-total, -tt
   specifies that the total number of symbols defined in the current
   symbol dictionary is to be printed.  If this is the only control
   argument specified, only the total is printed.
