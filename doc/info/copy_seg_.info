12/08/88  copy_seg_

Syntax:
dcl copy_seg_ external entry(char(*),char(*),char(*),char(*),
	    char(*),bit(1) aligned,fixed bin(35));
call copy_seg_(dir1, en1, dir2, en2, caller, errsw, code);


Function: This subroutine produces a copy of a Multics non-directory
branch.  Name duplication is handled by nd_handler_.


Arguments:
dir1
   the directory in which the original segment is found. (Input)
en1
   a name on the original segment. (Input)
dir2
   the directory in which the copy is to be created. (Input)
en2
   the name to be given the new segment. (Input)


caller
   the name of the calling procedure; it is used in calls to
   nd_handler_. (Input)
errsw
   indicates which segment the error reported via "code"
   occurred in; it is "0"b if the error was on the original
   segment and "1"b if on the target segment. (Output)
code
   a standard file system status code. (Output)


Notes: Any attempt to copy a segment into itself is refused and the
code error_table_$sameseg is returned to the caller.  If a name
duplication occurs and the conflicting name is not deleted, then the
code error_table_$namedup is returned to the caller.

If copying a non-empty mailbox requires that the max_length
characteristic of the source be applied to the target, then the target
max_length value will take on the default value that was given it when
created.
