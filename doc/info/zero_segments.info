01/15/87  zero_segments, zsegs

Syntax as a command:  zsegs star_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [zsegs star_names {-control_args}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of segments
with a zero-bit count that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_name
   is a star name to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.
-chase
   processes the targets of links when you specify a starname.
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   returns false if star_name is an invalid name or if access to tell
   of an entry's existence is lacking.
-no_chase
   does not process the targets of links when you specify a starname.
   (Default)
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   signals an error if star_name is an invalid name or if access to
   tell of an entry's existence is lacking.  (Default)


Notes:  Only one name per segment is returned; i.e., if a segment has
more than one name that matches star_name, only the first match found
is returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by zsegs is enclosed in
quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.
