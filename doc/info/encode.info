Syntax:  encode path1A {path2A ... path1N path2N} {-control_args}


Function: enciphers a segment's contents according to a key that is
not stored in the system.


Arguments:
path1N
   is the pathname of a segment to be enciphered.  The star convention
   is allowed.
path2N
   is the pathname of an enciphered segment to be produced.  If the
   last path2 is omitted, it is assumed to be the same as path1.  The
   equal convention is allowed.  The code suffix is always appended to
   path2.


Control arguments:
-key STR
   specifies the encipherment key STR on the command line and does not
   query for one. This control argument is useful in exec_com's for
   multiple invocations of the command with the same key.


Notes: The enciphered segment has the same length as the original
segment.  The encode command requests an encipherment key (from one to
11 characters not including space, semicolon, or tab).  Printing on
the terminal is suppressed while the key is typed.  The command then
requests that the key be typed again, to guard against the possibility
of mistyping the key.  If the two keys do not match, the key is
requested twice again.  All segments specified in an invocation of
encode are enciphered with the same key.
