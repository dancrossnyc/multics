:Entry: get_system_aim_attributes_: 01/19/83  get_system_aim_attributes_


Function: returns a structure describing the AIM attributes
defined on this system.


Syntax:
declare get_system_aim_attributes_ entry (ptr, char(*), ptr, 
     fixed bin(35));
call get_system_aim_attributes_ (area_ptr, version_wanted,
     aim_attributes_ptr, code);


Arguments:
area_ptr
   is a pointer to an area in which the aim_attributes structure is
   allocated.  (Input)
version_wanted
   is the version of the structure that the caller expects
   get_system_aim_attributes_ to return.  The only supported version at
   present is given by the value of the named constant
   AIM_ATTRIBUTES_VERSION_1 defined in the system include file
   aim_attributes.incl.pl1.  (Input)
aim_attributes_ptr
   is set to locate the aim_attributes structure allocated by this
   program.  (Output)


code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output) It can be one of the
   following:
   0
      the aim_attributes structure was successfully allocated.
   error_table_$unimplemented_version
      the version of the structure requested by the caller is not
      implemented by get_system_aim_attributes_.
   error_table_$noalloc
      there was not sufficient room in the caller's area to allocate
      the aim_attributes structure.


Notes: The aim_attributes structure is defined in the system include file
aim_attributes.incl.pl1 and has the following format:

   dcl 1 aim_attributes           aligned based,
         2 version                char(8) unaligned,
         2 access_class_ceiling   bit(72),
         2 levels (0 : 7),
           3 long_name            char(32) unaligned,
           3 short_name           char(8) unaligned,
         2 categories (18),
           3 long_name            char(32) unaligned,
           3 short_name           char(8) unaligned,


Structure elements:
   version
      is the version of this structure (currently
      AIM_ATTRIBUTES_VERSION_1).
   access_class_ceiling
      is the maximum authorization or access class in terms of the AIM
      attributes.
   levels
      are the sensitivity levels defined on this system.  Only the
      entries from levels(0) through levels(highest_level) contain
      definitions.  The remaining entries are all blank.
      long_name
         is the long name of this sensitivity level.
      short_name
         is the short name of this sensitivity level.


   categories
      are the access categories defined on this system.  Only the first
      n_categories entries of this substructure contain definitions.
      The remaining entries are all blank.
      long_name
         is the long name of this sensitivity level.
      short_name
         is the short name of this sensitivity level.
