03/01/84  pdt_copy

Syntax:  pdt_copy sat_dir pdt_dir admin_dir


Function:  is used by the crank, in master.ec, to copy the system
copies of the SAT and all the PDTs into an administrative directory.
These copies serve both as a backup of the system copies, and as a
summary of the (continually changing) usage figures, from which
accounting programs can compute month-to-date charges.


Arguments:
sat_dir
   is the directory containing the system copy of the SAT (normally
   >sc1).
pdt_dir
   is the directory containing the system copies of the PDTs (normally
   >sc1>pdt).
admin_dir
   is the administrative directory into which the SAT and PDTs should
   be copied (normally >udd>SysAdmin>admin>safe_pdts).


Notes:  This command attempts to copy the PDT of every active project
in the SAT.  If unable to copy a particular PDT, it prints an error
message and continues.
