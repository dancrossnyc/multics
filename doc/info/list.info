02/14/85  list, ls

Syntax as a command:  ls {entrynames} {-control_args}


Function: prints information about the entries in a single directory.
There are five entry types supported by list: segments, multisegment
files (MSFs), data management (DM) files, directories, and links.
Segments, DM files, and MSFs are referred to collectively as files;
segments, MSFs, DM files, and directories are referred to collectively
as branches.


Arguments:
entrynames
   are the names of entries to be listed.  The star convention
   can be used.  If no entrynames are given, all entries in the
   directory (of the default types or the types specified by
   control arguments) are listed.  A pathname can be given instead
   of an entryname, causing the entries specified by its entryname
   portion to be listed, in the directory specified by its
   directory portion.  It is an error to specify more than one
   directory to be listed in a single invocation of the list
   command.


Control arguments (directory):
-pathname path, -pn path
   list entries in the directory named path.  Note the restriction
   described above under "Arguments."


Control arguments (entry type):
-segment, -sm
   list segments.
-multisegment_file, -msf
   list multisegment files.
-data_management_file, -dmf
   lists data management files.
-file, -f
   list information about files (i.e., segments, MSFs, and DM files).
   (Default)
-directory, -dr
   list directories.
-branch, -br
   list information about branches (i.e., segments, MSFs, DM files, and
   directories).


-link, -lk
   list links.
-all, -a
   list information about all entry types in the following order:
   segments, MSFs, DM files, directories, and links.


Control arguments (column): (see also "Notes on columns" below)
-date_time_entry_modified, -dtem
   print date-time-entry-modified in the modification-date column.
-date_time_contents_modified, -dtcm
   print date-time-contents-modified in the modification-date column.
-date_time_used, -dtu
   print date-time-used column.
-mode, -md
   print mode column.
-record, -rec
   print records used in size column.
-length, -ln
   print length computed from bit count in size column.
-name, -nm
   print names column.


-count, -ct
   print name-count column, giving number of names.
-link_path, -lp
   print link-path column.


Control arguments (totals/header line):
-total, -tt
   print only number of entries and sum of their sizes.
-no_header, -nhe
   omit all heading lines and blank lines.


Control arguments (multiple-name entry):
-primary, -pri
   print only primary names in names column.
-match
   print only names that match one of entryname arguments.


Control arguments (entry order):
-sort KEY, -sr KEY
   sort entries by specified key column (see "Notes on sorting").
-reverse, -rv
   reverse order of listing (reverses either directory order, or
   order of sorting if sorting was specified).


Control arguments (entry exclusion):
-exclude entryname, -ex entryname
   excludes entries that match entryname; more than one instance of
   this argument can be given.
-first N, -ft N
   list only first N entries (after sorting, if it is specified) of
   each entry type being listed.
-from DATE, -fm DATE
   excludes entries having date/time (dtem, dtcm, dtu) before DATE
   (see "Notes on dates" below).
-to DATE
   excludes entries having date/time (dtem, dtcm, dtu) after DATE
   (see "Notes on dates").


Control arguments (output format):
-brief, -bf
   either overrides default columns (see "Notes on defaults")
   or, if -tt given, prints totals information for all selected entry
   types on single line.
-short, -sh
   print link paths starting two spaces after their names.


List of sorting keys: The KEY field in "-sort KEY" can be--
name, nm
   sort by primary name, in ASCII collating sequence.
record, rec
   sort by records, largest first.
length, ln
   sort by bit count length, largest first.
mode, md
   sort by mode; order:  null, r or s, rw or sm, re, rew or sma.
date_time_entry_modified, dtem
   sort by date-time-entry-modified, most recent first.
date_time_contents_modified, dtcm
   sort by date-time-contents-modified, most recent first.
count, ct
   sort by name count, highest first.


   Links can only be sorted by dtem, dtcm, nm, or ct.  When
   sorting by other columns, links are listed in the order in which
   they are found in the directory.  (See also "Defaults.")


Notes: Use of the -name, -mode, -record, -length, or -brief control
arguments overrides the default columns so that only the names column
and explicitly selected columns are printed.

Only one of the two modification dates, and only one of the two size
figures can be used at any one time.  Any combination of arguments
that specifies both items from either pair (e.g., printing dtcm but
sorting on dtem) is an error.


Notes on columns: The column printing order is--modification date,
dtu, mode, size, names, name count, and (for links only) link
pathname.  Modification date can be either date-time-contents-modified
or date-time-entry-modified (dtm is accepted as dtem).  Size can be
either records used or length computed from the bit count (default).


Notes on dates: The -from and -to control arguments compare DATE and
date.  The DATE string must be acceptable to the
convert_date_to_binary_ subroutine.  The date value is
date-time-entry-modified (or date-time-contents-modified, if it is
being printed or sorted on) in all cases except when date-time-used is
the only date being printed or sorted on.


Notes on defaults: Invoking list without any arguments is the same as
typing:
   list -pn [wd] -file -mode -length -name

If the sort column, COL, is omitted after -sort, the default sorting
column is: modification-date, if it is being printed; otherwise
date-time-used, if it is being printed; otherwise names.
