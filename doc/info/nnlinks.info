Syntax:  nnlinks star_names {-control_arg}


Syntax as active function:  [nnlinks star_names {-control_arg}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of links for
which the target entry exists that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_names
   are star names to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.


Notes:  Only one name per link is returned; i.e., if a link has more
than one name that matches star_name, only the first match found is
returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by nonnull_links is
enclosed in quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single
argument regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.
