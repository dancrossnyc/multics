:Info: backup.gi: 02/04/82 backup

     There are two types of backup:  hierarchy backup and volume
backup.

     The hierarchy backup system dumps (copies) user segments and
directories onto removable storage (magnetic tape).  The dumping
is conventionally done using the processes Backup.SysDaemon and
Dumper.SysDaemon.  The information dumped can be recovered by the
operations staff at the user's request.

     A backup system operates at the physical storage volume level.
It provides physical volume rebuilding in the event of a failure, as
well as segment and subtree retrieval.  See the enter_retrieval_request
command.


:Info: bit_count.gi: 02/04/82 bit count

     An index to the last bit of useful information in a segment.  For
example, a segment that contains 43 characters starting at the
beginning has a bit count of 387 (9*43).  (A segment may, however,
contain useful data independent of its bit count.) See the
set_bit_count and adjust_bit_count commands.


:Info: blocked.gi: 02/04/82 blocked

     The state a process is in when it is not executing and is waiting
for some event to occur (such as the user typing a command line).


:Info: bound_segment.gi: 02/04/82 bound segment

     A group of (usually related) object segments bound into one
object segment to save space and speed up references (calls, etc.)
between them.  The process of binding segments is similar to linkage
editing on other systems and is done by use of the bind command.  


:Info: branch.gi: 02/04/82 branch

     An item cataloged in a directory: segment, multisegment file or
another directory but not a link.
