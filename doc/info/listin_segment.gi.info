10/02/85  Format of a Listin Segment

The format of a listin segment consists of three parts--header,
fields, and data records.

The header contains several statements that give information about the
records.  The statements are:
   Comment_delimiter: c;     or Cd: c;
   Field_delimiter: f;       or Fd: f;
   Record_delimiter: r;      or Rd: r;
   Field_names: fn1,...fnK; or Fn: fn1,...fnK;
   Records:


The Comment_delimiter statement specifies the character(s) used to
delimit comments within the listin segment.  If you don't give it, no
comments are allowed.  The delimiter can either be "pl1", in which
case comments begin with "/*" and end with "*/", or a single character
chosen from the set !#$%&*=?@^|~, in which case that character is used
to begin and end a comment.  The Field_delimiter statement specifies
the character used to separate fields within a record; if you don't
supply it, the default is "=".  The Record_delimiter statement
specifies the character used to separate records; if you don't specify
it, the default is "$".  Record and field delimiters must be one
character long and must be from the set !#$%&*=?@^|~.  The Field_names
statement specifies all the field names that you can use in the listin
segment.  It is required.  Field names can be up to 32 characters
long, must begin with an alphabetic character, and otherwise must
contain only alphanumeric characters and underscores.


Everything after the end-of-the-header statement is taken to be record
information.  (The end-of-the-header statement is "Records:".)  Each
record must begin with a record delimiter.  Each field must begin with
a field delimiter.  Each field delimiter must be directly followed by
a field name.  The optional field value follows the field name,
separated by one or more white space characters (NL, SP, HT, NP, VT).
If leading and trailing white space is not to be removed from the
field value or if the field value contains record delimiter or field
delimiter characters, enclose the entire field value in quotes.  As in
PL/I, to enclose a quote character in a quoted string, double the
quote.


The fields contain the various types of information stored in a list
(e.g., first name, last name, street address, date of employment,
etc.).  Because data records are stored separately within a listin
file, give the field names with each data record.  Within a data
record, a field is specified by a field delimiter character followed
immediately by the field name (e.g., =lname).

The data records (or records) contain the specific information
associated witht the subject of each record.  A record can contain
some or all of the fields defined in the header, and fields not
specified for a record are considered to be null.  Duplicate fields
are not allowed within a record.
