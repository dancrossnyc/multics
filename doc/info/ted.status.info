Description

163  
When a buffer exceeds 99999 lines, "x" gets a size condition.

162  
"vd/xxx/" which deletes the last line of the buffer leaves "."
undefined, unlike ted_3.0y.

"g*/./ P" prints null lines.  

120  phx15889
Given a regular expression of the form /aa.*xyz.*ttl/ the matching does
not give what people think it should because of the way it is
implemented.  People seem to expect that if the "xyz" is found and then
no "ttl" can be, that the search would back up and look for another
"xyz".  This is not the case.  If a search fails, it always goes back
to the beginning of the expression, moves ahead 1 character in the
string being searched and tries again.
