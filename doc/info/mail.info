02/15/85  mail, ml

Syntax as a command:  ml path User1...{UserN} {-control_args}
                 or:  ml {destination} {-control_args}


Function: sends a message to another user or prints messages in any
mailbox to which you have sufficient access.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment to be sent or is an asterisk (*) to
   indicate that you wish to type a message to be sent (see "Notes on
   composing mail" below).
User_idi
   is the User_id of a person to whom mail is to be sent.  Mail is sent
   to the mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx for each
   Person_id.Project_id (User_id) argument in the command line.
destination
   can be User_id to specify a mailbox.  If destination contains a < or
   >, it is the pathname of a mailbox.  The mbx suffix is assumed in
   this case.  You cannot use destination with -pathname.  (Default:
   your default mailbox)


Control arguments:
-acknowledge, -ack
   requests acknowledgement of the pieces of mail.  The acknowledgement
   consists of the string:
      "Acknowledge message of <date-time sent>"
   and is sent as an interactive message when you invoke this command
   to print mail.
-brief, -bf
   prints the total number of messages in the mailbox.  If the mailbox
   is empty, nothing is printed.
-exclude STR, -ex STR
   ignores messages sent by users whose User_id matches the User_id
   specified in STR.  The star convention is allowed.  If you supplied
   -match, exclusion is performed before matching.


-header, -he
   prints only the header line for each message.  No messages are
   deleted.
-match STR
   prints messages sent by users whose User_id matches the User_id
   specified in STR.  The star convention is allowed.  If you gave
   -exclude, exclusion is performed before matching.
-no_notify, -nnt
   suppresses the sending of an interactive "You have mail"
   notification.
-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies a mailbox by pathname.  The mbx suffix is assumed.


Notes: The extended access used on mailboxes (which are ring 1
segments) permits you to control other users' access to it.  Adding,
reading, and deleting messages are independent privileges under
extended access; for example, you can give a user access to only add
messages, to other user access to add messages and to read and delete
only the messages he or she has added.  Mail and interactive messages
sent to a user are placed in the mailbox
>udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx.

If you are accepting interactive messages, you receive an immediate
notification of the form:
   You have mail from Person_id.Project_id.


Segments to be mailed have a maximum length of one record (4096 ASCII
characters).

See print_mail, read_mail, and send_mail.


Notes on composing mail: If path is *, mail responds with "Input" and
accepts lines from the terminal until you type a period on a line by
itself.  The typed lines are then sent to the specified user(s).


Notes on printing mail: When the contents of the mailbox named by path
are printed, they are preceded by a line of the form:
   N messages.

Each message is preceded by a line of the form
   i) From: Person_id.Project_id (sent_from) date time (N lines)
where:
i
   is the incremental number of the message.  The messages are printed
   in ascending numerical order; the oldest one is numbered 1.
Person_id
   is your registered person identifier.
Project_id
   is the name of the project on which you were logged in when you sent
   the message.


sent_from
   is an optional field that further identifies you, e.g., your
   anonymous log-in name.
date
   is the date you sent the message, of the form mm/dd/yy to indicate
   the month, day, and year.
time
   is the time you sent the message, of the form hhmm.m zzz www to
   indicate the hours, minutes, and tenths of minutes in 24-hour time
   followed by the time zone and day of the week.
N lines
   is the number of lines in the message.


After printing all messages, this command asks whether you want them
deleted.  If yes, all messages are deleted; if no, no messages are
deleted.  In either case, your return to command level.

If you quit while the messages are being printed and then issue
program_interrupt, the command stops printing and asks whether to
delete all messages, including those that were not printed.


Notes on creating a mailbox: A default mailbox is created the first
time you issue print_mail, read_mail, or accept_messages.  The default
mailbox is
   >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx


Notes on extended access: Access on a newly created mailbox is set to
adrosw for you, aow for *.SysDaemon.*, and aow for *.*.*.  The types of
extended access for mailboxes are:
add, a
   adds a message.
delete, d
   deletes any message.
read, r
   reads any message.
own, o
   reads or delete only your own messages, i.e., those sent by you.


status, s
   finds out how many messages are in the mailbox.
wakeup, w
   sends a wakeup when adding a message (used by send_message).

The modes n, null, and "" indicate null access.
