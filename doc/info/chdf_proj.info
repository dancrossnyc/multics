02/02/84  chdf_proj

Syntax:  chdf_proj Person_id Project_id


Function: allows the accounting administrator to change the default
project for a single user.  It changes the user's default project in
the PNT found in >sc1.  Thus, even if the user has changed his default
project with the -change_default_project control argument to the login
command, the chdf_proj command overrides the user's change.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose default project is to be changed.
Project_id
   is the new default project for the user.
