07/23/84  hyphenate_word_


Function:  The hyphenate_word_ subroutine returns the character
position at which a word can be hyphenated.  The word is located in a
dictionary via the dict search list.


Usage syntax:
declare hyphenate_word_ entry (char(*), fixed bin,
  fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call hyphenate_word_ (string, space, break, code);

-OR-

declare hyphenate_word_ entry (char(*), fixed bin, fixed bin);
call hyphenate_word_ (string, space, break);


Arguments:
string (input)
   the text word that is to be split.
space (input)
   the number of print positions remaining in the line.
break (output)
   the number of characters from the word that should be placed on the
   current line; it should be at least one less than the value of space
   (to allow for the hyphen), and can be 0 to specify that the word is
   not to be broken.  Thus if the word "calling" is to be split, and
   six spaces remain in the line, the procedure should return the value
   4 (adjustment is performed after hyphenation).


code (output)
   a standard status code.  In order to retain compatibility with an
   older version of this subroutine, this argument is optional,
   depending upon how hyphenate_word_ is declared in the calling
   program.  If this subroutine is called with only three arguments,
   then no code is returned.
