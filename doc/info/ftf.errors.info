Description

4  phx18647
The TRAN protocol over PVE, while not clearly documented anywhere,
seems to require a "$*$DIS" character string to terminate the transfer
from host to DPS6.  See the TR for the code location to be changed.

3  phx18646
The DPS6 is not very fast, and the PVE protocol is not very robust, so
l6_ftf_ should delay at certain points in its dialogue with the DPS6.
In particular, after sending the positive ack, and before the first
prompt for a transfer from the DPS6 to Multics.  See the TR for the
location in the code.

2  phx11874
l6_ftf does not correctly handle files which do not end in a newline,
e.g.  they end in a formfeed.  Also, error messages should be printed
rather than error table numbers.

1  phx08618
There seems to be a problem in the polled vip multiplexer which causes
l6_ftf to have problems with transferring large files.
