03/31/83  sus_signal_handler_


The sus_signal_handler_ subroutine is the static condition handler for
the sus_ condition.  The standard process overseers establish this
handler by calling sct_manager_$set.  For interactive processes, the
sus_ condition typically occurs when the process is disconnected from
its login terminal channel.  For absentee processes, the sus_ condition
occurs when the operators suspend the job.

When the user reconnects to the process, sus_signal_handler_ may
attempt to execute an exec_com, according to whether
reconnect_ec_enable or reconnect_ec_disable was last called before
disconnection.


Entry points in sus_signal_handler_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  reconnect_ec_enable:  02/11/83
sus_signal_handler_$reconnect_ec_enable


Function:  This entry point enables searching for the segment
reconnect.ec when the user reconnects to a disconnected process.  As a
result, sus_signal_handler_ looks first in the user's home directory,
then in his project directory (>user_dir_dir>Project_name), and finally
in >system_control_dir.  When the reconnect.ec segment is found, the
command "exec_com >Directory_name>reconnect" is executed.


Syntax:
declare sus_signal_handler_$reconnect_ec_enable entry;
call sus_signal_handler_$reconnect_ec_enable ();


Notes:
The use of reconnect.ec is enabled automatically by the standard
process overseer process_overseer_.

Invocation of the reconnect.ec is not automatically enabled by the
project_start_up_ process overseer.  Thus, when using
project_start_up_, the project administrator may enable the invocation
of reconnect.ec at any point in the project_start_up.ec by using the
reconnect_ec_enable command.

The current command processor is used to execute the reconnect.ec
command.  If the user is using the abbrev command processor, any
applicable abbreviation will be expanded.


:Entry:  reconnect_ec_disable:  02/11/83
sus_signal_handler_$reconnect_ec_disable


Function:  This entry point reverses the effect of the
sus_signal_handler_$reconnect_ec_enable entry.  After reconnection to a
disconnected process, there is no attempt made to find or invoke the
exec_com "reconnect.ec".


Syntax:
declare sus_signal_handler_$reconnect_ec_disable entry;
call sus_signal_handler_$reconnect_ec_disable ();
