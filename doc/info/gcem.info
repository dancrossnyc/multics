08/02/84  gcos_extract_module, gcem

Syntax as a command:  gcem control_path input_path output_path
   {-control_arg}


Function:  This command extracts one or more modules from a (tape
format) GCOS system-loadable file, or a simulator-format software
library, placing them in an output file.  The names of the modules to
be extracted are given in a control file.


Arguments:
control_path
   is the pathname of a segment containing the names of the modules to
   be extracted (in lowercase ASCII), each on a separate line.  This
   segment can be created by the gcos_library_summary command, using
   the -brief control argument and preceding it by the file_output
   command, and then editing the resulting segment to remove the names
   of unwanted modules; or the segment can be created directly by any
   of the Multics editors.
input_path
   is the pathname of a file containing GCOS modules.  It can be a file
   copied from a GCOS total system tape with gcos_pull_tapefile, or it
   may be a simulator-format library produced by gcos_build_library.


output_path
   is the pathname of the output file into which the extracted modules
   are to be written.  If the file already exists, it is appended to,
   enabling the construction of a single library from several smaller
   ones.
control_arg
   can be -brief which inhibits printing the name of each module
   copied.


Notes:  The names of each module copied are printed on user_output,
unless the -brief control argument is given.  The names of any
requested modules that are not found in the input file are printed on
error_output.

This command cannot be used to manipulate a random system-loadable file
(GCOS format **, Q* or H* file).
