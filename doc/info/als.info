10/20/86  append_list, als

Syntax as a command:  als path {-control_args}


Function:  adds a record to a lister file.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file.  The suffix lister must be the
   last component of the lister segment name; however, if path does
   not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-field_name field_name STR, -fn field_name STR
   assigns the value of STR to the field indicated by field_name.  If
   STR contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes.  If this
   control argument is not given, those fields without it are
   assigned null values.  If this control argument is not given at
   least once, then the default of -prompt is applied.
-prompt, -pmt
   prompts the user for each field in the file.  The response is
   given, all on one line, and is terminated with a newline
   character.  This control argument is incompatible with the use of
   the -field_name control argument.  (Default)


-string STR, -str STR
   uses STR as a character string with no special interpretation,
   preventing STR from being interpreted as a control argument.  It
   is to be used with the -field_name control argument (e.g.,
   "-field_name rating -string -20").


Notes:  The append_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.
A severity of 2 is set when the record is not appended or the
invocation of append_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 0 is
set when the record is successfully appended and the command
terminates normally.
