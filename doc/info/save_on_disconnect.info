03/13/80	save_on_disconnect

Syntax:  save_on_disconnect


Function:	 reverses the effect of the no_save_on_disconnect command,
re-enabling process preservation across hangups in the user's process.


Notes:  This command is only meaningful if process preservation was in
effect for the process at login time, either by default or because the
-save_on_disconnect control argument was specified on the login command
line.
