     This document  lists the  features  available in Multics APL
that are not  available in VS  APL.  Some of  the features listed
below are extensions to  existing facilities and some are totally
new features.  This list is subject to revision.

     All  of  the   language   features   described  in  the  IBM
publications  "APL Language",  GC26-3847-4,  and "VS APL for CMS:
Terminal   User's  Guide",   SH20-9067-1,   except  as  noted  in
apl_vs_vsapl.incompat.info, are available in Multics APL.

     The following new features are available:

1.  Comments are  no longer  restricted to a  line by themselves;
    they may appear to  the right of any  APL statement (even the
    function header).

2.  Error messages may  be printed in  either short or long mode;
    the former is  identical to  VS APL, the  latter explains the
    particular error more fully.

3.  APL functions may call PL/I programs, and these PL/I programs
    may, in turn, call programs written in BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN,
    or PL/I.  To the  APL function, the  PL/I "external function"
    appears  exactly like any  other APL  function.  The external
    function may  be  niladic,  monadic,  or  dyadic, may  report
    errors, and may allocate  return values in the same manner as
    any  builtin  APL   operator.   This   facility  allows  easy
    communication  between APL  and  programs  written  in  other
    languages, and  also allows heavily  used APL functions to be
    coded in PL/I for utmost efficiency.

4.  Multics APL supports EBCD,  Correspondence, typewriter-paired
    APL/ASCII,  bit-paired  APL/ASCII, and full  ASCII terminals.
    Multics APL is  also fully usable over  the ARPA Network, and
    from Multics absentee (batch).

5.  A special subsystem interface  is provided for projects which
    may wish to  encapsulate their users  entirely within the APL
    environment.

6.  For  compatibility  with   Multics  typing  conventions,  the
    following  APL  graphics  are  used as  the  erase  and  kill
    characters:
         omega     erases previous character or white space
         alpha     kills everything on same line to its left
    On ASCII  terminals,  the normal  Multics  graphics for these
    functions,  number sign and  commercial-at  sign, may also be
    used.

7.  The Multics APL  file system requires  no knowledge of JCL or
    storage formats.  All of the  operations are easily performed
    through a complete set of system functions.

8.  The grade operators have been extended to sort arrays, column
    by column.

9.  The value of the integer tolerance, which specifies how close
    a  floating  point  number   must be  to  an  integer  to  be
    considered  exactly  equal to   that  integer,  is  available
    through a  system  variable.   (This value is  similar to the
    comparison tolerance  ("fuzz"), which specifies how close two
    numbers must be to be considered equal).

10. Multics  APL  utilizes the  Multics  virtual  memory to allow
    almost  arbitrarily  large  workspaces.   Single  values  may
    contain over 130,000 elements.  The entire workspace may grow
    to over 31 million bytes in  the present implementation;  and
    this limit is expandable.

11. In general, 1-element vectors, arrays, and higher-dimensional
    matrices may  appear  in any  expression  where a  scalar  is
    permitted.

12. Multics APL  preserves the original  typing style of the user
    in  calculator mode  and  functions.  Only  comment lines and
    lines  with  labels  are  changed;  as  in VS  APL,  they are
    exdented one space.

13. Several  new  requests have  been  added to the  APL function
    editor.   The  capability of  searching and  substituting  by
    context has  been added.   The editor also  performs a simple
    syntax check  of the  function before it is  closed, catching
    many  common   typing  mistakes,  and   allowing  them to  be
    corrected before leaving the editor.


14. The  Multics APL  character set is  a  compatible superset of
    ASCII; hence,  character  data can be  easily and efficiently
    shared between APL and other Multics programming languages.
