02/06/85  check_info_segs, cis

Syntax as a command:  cis {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [cis {-control_args}]


Function: prints a list of info segments modified since a given time.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints or returns absolute pathnames of segments rather than
   entrynames.
-brief, -bf
   does not print either the "No change" message or, if used with
   -call, the names of changed info segs.  Don't use -brief with the
   active function.
-call cmdline
   calls the command processor with "cmdline path" for each changed
   segment; path is the absolute pathname of a changed segment.  If
   cmdline contains blanks, it must be enclosed in quotes.  Don't use
   -call with the active function.


-date DT, -dt DT
   uses the date DT instead of the date in your default value segment.
   The date in the value segment is not updated.
   (See time_strings.gi.)
-long, -lg
   prints the date-time-entry-modified as well as the segment name.
   Don't use -long with the active function.
-no_update, -nud
   does not update the date in your value segment.
-pathname star_path, -pn star_path
   checks all segments that match star_path, which is a pathname with a
   star name in the entryname portion.  You can supply more than one
   -pathname.  If you give none, the directories in the "info_segments"
   ("info_segs", "info") search list are used; **.info is used as the
   entryname.


-time_checked, -tmck
   prints the date-time that is stored in your default value segment
   indicating from when checking of modified info segments occurs if
   -date is not given.  This control argument is incompatible with all
   others when used with the active function.  It does not update the
   time in your value segment when it is the only control argument.


Notes: The first time you invoke cis, it sets the date in your default
value segment.  The value segment is created if one does not exist and
is normally
   >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.value
but can be changed by the value_set_path command.

For links that match the star names, the date-time-entry-modified of
the link's target is checked rather than that of the link itself.

Zero-length info segments are not reported as being modified.

The cis active function returns entrynames of selected info segments
separated by spaces.  If you give -absolute_pathname, it returns full
pathnames of info segments separated by spaces.


Since the cis active function also sets the date in your
default value segment, a command line using [cis] sets this date before
processing any of the returned info seg names.  As a result, segments
can be unintentionally skipped and not seen a second time if a command
line containing [cis] is interrupted.
