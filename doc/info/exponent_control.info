Syntax:  exponent_control -control_args


Function:	 controls the behavior of the system in the event of a
computational overflow or underflow.


Control arguments:
-restart STRs, -rt STRs
   specifies that overflow or underflow or both are to be automatically
   restarted with defined results.  STRs can be either or both of the
   strings "overflow" or "underflow."
-fault STRs, -flt STRs
   specifies that overflow or underflow or both are to cause the normal
   fault conditions.
-overflow_value STR, -ovfv STR
   specifies the value to be returned for an overflowing computation.
   STR must be specified.  If -overflow_value is omitted, the largest
   possible floating point value is used.
-print, -pr
   prints the current behavior with respect to exponent errors and the
   current overflow value.


Notes: By default Multics signals fault conditions on computational
overflows and underflows (see the Programmer's Reference Manual, Order
No. AG91, for more information on faults and other unusual conditions).

This command only affects the system's handling of exponent overflow
and underflow when the overflow or underflow condition is raised.  In
certain cases, the error condition is raised instead.  This command
does not affect the system's handling of the cases in which the error
condition is raised.
