Syntax:  attach_mowse {-control_args}, atm {-control_args}


Function:
Enters the MOWSE environment.  Sends a message to the PC requesting
that it enter the complete MOWSE environment (i.e.  accept MOWSE
messages).  On Multics, moves the attachment of the specified switch
to a mowse_i/o switch.  Attaches the first switch via mowse_i/o to
the second.


Control arguments:
-debug {path}
   Enables packet recording.  Writes all incoming and outgoing packets
   to the specified file, defaults to [wd]>debug.mowse_io_
-no_debug
   Disables packet recording.  (DEFAULT)
-trace {path}
   Enables tracing of Multics application messages by writing them to a
   Multics segment. (DEFAULT -- trace.mowse_io_)
-no_trace
   Disables tracing of Multics application messages. (DEFAULT)


-force, -fc
   Forces the mowse_i/o attachment irregardless of terminal type.
-no_force, -nfc
   Does not force the mowse_i/o attachment thus requiring the terminal
   type setting "MOWSE".   (DEFAULT)
-io_switch {switchname}, -iosw {switchname}
   Specifies the switch for the MOWSE environment.  (DEFAULT -- tty_
   -login_channel)


-start_up {entryname}, -su {entryname}
   Specifies which capabilities (if any) are to be loaded at the
   initialization of MOWSE on Multics.
-no_start_up, -nsu
   Does not allow start_up. (DEFAULT)


-escape N, -esc N
   Specifies that the N character (given as an octal value) is to be
   escaped when transmitted to the PC.
-network, -net
   Specifies that a network has been used in order to connect to
   Multics.  This forces end of packet (EOP) characters to be
   altered such that Multics sees transmits the EOP as a <CR>
   and receives the EOP as a <LF>.  This argument must be used
   ONLY if the MOWSE /N control_arg has been used to invoke
   MOWSE on the PC.


Notes:
The MOWSE environment provides a special connection between a
Multics process and a Personal Computer.  To enter the MOWSE
environment on Multics, the corresponding environment must have
been previously entered on the PC.  To establish the MOWSE
environment, the user must:

   1. First enter the MOWSE environment on the PC
   2. Connect to Multics.
   3. Invoke MOWSE on Multics. (atm)
