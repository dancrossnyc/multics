Syntax as a command:  help {info_names} {-control_args}


Function:	 prints descriptions of system commands, active functions,
and subroutines; as well as miscellaneous information about system
status, system changes, and general information.	Help selects this
information from segments maintained on-line, which are in a special
format, called info segments (info segs).

For information on the format of info segs, type "help info_seg.gi".


Arguments:
info_names
   specify the information to be printed.  The suffix ".info" is
   assumed.  If a pathname is specified, it identifies the info seg to
   be printed.  Otherwise, help searches for segments matching an
   entryname using the "info_segments" search list.  For subroutines,
   an entry point name can be included in the info_name (e.g.,
   subroutine_$entry_point).	The star convention is allowed, except
   when an entry point name is specified or when the -entry_point
   control argument is used.	(See "Notes on star convention" below.)

   If no info_names are specified, help prints the default info seg
   help_infos.gi.info which gives a brief introduction to the help
   facility.

   If the help command fails to find an info seg corresponding to a
   given info_name, use the list_help command to find info segs which
   contain the specified info_name in their entrynames.


Control arguments for selecting info segs:
-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies the pathname of a segment containing the info seg to be
   printed.  It is useful when the info to be printed is in the working
   directory, or when the pathname begins with a minus (-) character.
-entry_point, -ep
   selects the info describing the main entry point of a subroutine,
   if there is one.  For example, "help ioa_ -ep" prints the info
   describing the ioa_$ioa_ subroutine entry point.


Control arguments for information selection:
-all, -a
   prints the entire info or subroutine entry point description without
   intervening questions.
-brief, -bf
   prints a brief summary of a command, active function or subroutine
   info seg with no intervening questions.  The summary includes the
   Syntax section, and (for commands and active functions) a list of
   control arguments and/or other keywords used by the command.
-brief_header, -bfhe
   shortens the long heading line that is printed by default.  Instead,
   help prints a brief heading line, consisting of the heading and line
   count.


-case_sensitive, -cs
   when used with either -section of -search, will perform the
   requested action in a case sensitive manner.
-control_arg STR, -ca STR
   prints only the descriptions of the control (or other) arguments
   whose names contain STR.  STR must NOT include a leading minus sign
   (-).  For example, "help mail -ca brief match exclude"
   prints descriptions of the -brief, -match and -exclude control
   arguments of the mail command.  All arguments following -ca until
   the next control argument are treated as STR.
-header, -he
   prints only a long heading line consisting of the pathname of the
   info seg, heading, and line count.  No other information is printed.
   This control argument conflicts with all other information selection
   control arguments.


-list_entry_points, -lep
   lists the entry points in a subroutine info segment.
-non_case_sensitive, -ncs
   when used with either -section or -search, will perform the
   requested action in a non-case sensitive manner.  This is the
   default.
-title
   lists the section titles used in the info seg (including section
   line counts), then asks if the user wishes to see the first section.


Control arguments for selecting a starting paragraph:
-search STRs, -srh STRs
   begins printing with the first paragraph containing any of STRs.
   STRs can be typed in lowercase, since case is ignored when
   matching.  All arguments following the -search control argument are
   treated as STRs, so -search must be the last control argument
   given.  The search usually begins with the first paragraph, but
   when -section is also specified it begins with the matching section
   and continues to the last paragraph (i.e., without wraparound).
-section STRs, -scn STRs
   prints the first section whose title contains the strings STRs.
   The entire section title is not required.  STRs can be typed in
   lowercase, since case is ignored when matching. All arguments
   following the -section control argument until the next control
   argument are treated as STRs.


Control arguments for paragraph grouping:
   The following control arguments determine how much information help
   prints before asking if the user wants to see more.
-minlines I
   sets the minimum paragraph size to I lines.  Paragraphs smaller than
   this size are printed with preceding paragraphs.  The default is 4.
-maxlines J
   sets the maximum paragraph grouping size to J lines so no more than
   J lines of information are printed before asking if the user wants
   more help.  The default is 15.


List of responses:
   The responses accepted when help questions the user are given
   here.  Those responses that search the info seg or list section
   titles operate from the current paragraph to the end of the info
   seg.  No wraparound feature is employed.
brief, bf
   prints a summary of a command, active function or subroutine info
   seg, including Syntax section and a list of control arguments, then
   repeats the previous question.
control_arg STR,  ca STR
   prints descriptions of control (or other) arguments whose names
   contain STR, then repeats the previous question.


entry_point {EP_NAME},  ep {EP_NAME}
   skips to the description of subroutine entry point EP_NAME.  The
   EP_NAME can be specified as entry_point_name or
   subroutine_$entry_point_name.  If EP_NAME is omitted, help skips to
   the description of the subroutine_$subroutine_ entry point, if one
   exists.
header, he
   prints a long heading line to identify the current info seg.  The
   line consists of the pathname of the info seg, heading, and line
   count.
list_entry_points, lep
   lists the entry points in a subroutine info segment.
list_requests, lr
   prints information about available help requests.


no, n
   exits from the current info seg, and begins printing the next info
   seg selected by info_names given in the help command.  Returns from
   the help command if all selected info segs have been printed.
quit, q
   causes the help command to return without printing the remaining
   info segs selected by the info_names.


rest {-scn} {-all_entrypoints}  {-entrypoint},
r {-scn} {-aep}  {-ep}
   prints the rest of the info seg without intervening questions.  If
   the -section control argument is specified, help prints only the
   rest of the current section without questions.  When the section has
   been printed, help then asks whether the user wants to see the next
   section.  If -all_entrypoints is specified, help will print the rest
   of the remaining entry points.  If -entrypoint is specified help
   will print the rest of the current entry point only (default).


search {STRs} {-case_sensitive} {-non_case_sensitive } {-top},
srh {STRs} {-top} {-cs} {-ncs}
   skips to the next paragraph containing STRs.  Paragraph selection is
   performed as described above for the -search control argument.  If
   -top or -t is specified, searching starts at the beginning of the
   info seg.  If STRs is omitted, help uses the strings from the
   previous search response or -search control argument.
   -case_sensitive and -non_case_sensitive are mutually exclusive and
   will search the string as specified.


section {STRs} {-case_sensitive} {-non_case_sensitive} {-top},
scn {STRs} {-cs} {-ncs} {-top}
   skips to the next section whose title contains STRs.  Title matching
   is performed as described above for the -section control argument.
   If -top or -t is specified, title searching starts at the beginning
   of the info.  If STRs is omitted, help uses the search strings from
   the previous section response or -section control argument.
   -case_sensitive and -non_case_sensitive are mutually exclusive and
   will search the string as specified.


skip {-scn} {-rest} {-seen} {-ep}, s {-scn} {-rest} {-seen} {-ep}
   skips the next paragraph and asks whether the user wants to see the
   paragraph following it.  If -section or -scn is specified, help
   skips all paragraphs of the current section.  If -rest or -r,
   -entry_point or -ep are specified, help skips the rest of this info
   seg or subroutine entry point description, continuing with the next.
   If -seen is specified, help skips to the next paragraph that the
   user has not seen.  Only one of these control arguments can be used
   at a time.
title {-top}
   lists titles and line counts of all sections remaining in the
   current info seg.  If -top or -t is specified, help lists all
   section titles.


top, t
   skips to the beginning of the info seg, prints the heading line, and
   asks whether the user wants to see the first section.  This is
   useful if the user wishes to review earlier parts of the info seg.
yes, y
   prints the next paragraph of information, then asks whether the user
   wants more help.
?
   prints a list of available responses.
.
   prints "help" to identify the current interactive environment.
.. command_line
   passes the remainder of the response to the Multics command
   processor as a command line.


Notes:  The -all, -brief, -control_arg and -title control arguments are
mutually exclusive.

When -section or -search control arguments are specified and no
matching paragraph is found in any of the info segs selected by an
info_name or info selection control argument, that info seg is passed
over without comment.  Thus, the starting paragraph control arguments
serve as a secondary info selection mechanism.


The starting paragraph control arguments can be used with any of the
information selection control arguments listed above, but its effect
differs depending upon which of them are used.  When -section or
-search is used with -header, only the heading lines for infos
containing a matching paragraph are listed.  The matching paragraph
itself is not printed.  When they are used with -brief or -control_arg,
help prints a heading line and then the information selected by -brief
or -control_arg.  The matching paragraph is not printed.

When -section or -search is used with -brief_header, a brief heading
line is printed preceding the matching paragraph.	 When used with
-title, help prints a heading line, then the list of section titles,
and finally the matching paragraph.  When used with -all, the entire
info is printed for infos containing a matching paragraph.


The help command remembers which paragraphs the user has seen and which
have been skipped or not yet reached.  It asks the user to "Review"
paragraphs seen before, but asks if "More help" is needed for unseen
paragraphs.  It stops printing if all paragraphs have been seen when
the end of info is reached.  However, if any paragraphs were skipped,
help asks if user wants to see them.  If the response is "yes", the
first unseen paragraph is printed.  The user can then answer "skip
-seen" to view subsequent unseen paragraphs.

The question/answer dialogue continues until all of the information is
printed, or until the user replies "no".
