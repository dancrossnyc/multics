Function:  returns true if STRA is greater than STRB according to ASCII
collating sequence; otherwise it returns false.


Notes:  The strings are compared character by character according to
their ASCII code value (i.e., if the first character in each string has
the same ASCII code value, compare the second character; if their
values are identical, compare the third character; etc.).

To make numeric comparisons of strings, see the descriptions of
ngreater and nless.
