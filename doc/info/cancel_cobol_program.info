02/23/84  cancel_cobol_program, ccp

Syntax:  ccp names {-control_arg}


Function: cancels one or more programs in the current COBOL run unit.


Arguments:
names
   are reference names of COBOL programs active in the current run
   unit.


Control arguments:
-retain_data, -retd
   leaves the data segment associated with the program intact for
   debugging purposes (see "Notes").


Notes: The results of this command and the execution of the CANCEL
statement from within a COBOL program are similar.  The only
difference is that if a name argument is not actually a component of
the current run unit, an error message is issued and no action is
taken; for the CANCEL statement no warning is given in such a case.

To preserve program data for debugging purposes, -retain_data should
be used.  The data associated with the canceled program is in its last
used state; it is not restored to its initial state until the next
time the program is invoked in the run unit.


Canceling ensures that the next time the program is invoked within the
run unit its data is in its initial state.  Any files that have been
opened by the program and are still open are closed, and the COBOL data
segment is truncated.

Refer to display_cobol_run_unit (dcr), stop_cobol_run (scr), and
run_cobol for more information.
