:Entry: set_bit_offset_: 02/13/84  set_bit_offset_

Function: returns a pointer to the specified bit in the segment
referenced by the input pointer.


Syntax:
declare set_bit_offset_ entry (ptr, fixed bin(24)) returns (ptr)
     reducible;
new_pointer_value = set_bit_offset_ (pointer_value, bit_offset);


Arguments:
pointer_value
   identifies the segment in which the desired bit resides.  (Input)
bit_offset
   is the offset (relative to the base of the segment) of the desired
   bit.  (Input)
new_pointer_value
   is the result of this operation.  (Output)


Notes:  The first bit in a segment has a bit offset of zero.

If the value of bit_offset is negative or greater than 9,437,183 (the
offset of the last bit in a 256K word segment), the resulting value of
the call is not defined.
