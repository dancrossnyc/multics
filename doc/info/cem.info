02/24/84  change_error_mode, cem

Syntax:  cem {-control_args}


Function: controls the amount of information printed by the default
handler for system conditions.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints only the condition name.
-long, -lg
   prints more complete messages.


Notes: There are three modes of error messages--brief, normal, and
long.  If this command is not issued, the message is in normal mode.
If issued with no control argument, normal mode is restored.

For a complete discussion of conditions and their handling, see the
Programmer's Reference Manual (AG91).  Refer to the description of the
reprint_error command for a similar, but more selective, capability.
