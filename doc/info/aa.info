Syntax:  aa paths {-alm_args} {-dp_args} {-control_args}


Function: submits an absentee request to perform ALM assemblies.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of segments to be assembled.
-alm_args
   are control arguments accepted by the alm command.
-dp_args
   are control arguments (except -delete) accepted by the dprint
   command.


Control arguments:
-queue N, -q N
   is the priority queue of the request.  The default queue is defined
   by the system administrator.  See "Notes" for a description of the
   interaction with the dprinting of listing files.
-hold
   does not dprint or delete any listing files.
-output_file path, -of path
   puts absentee output in a segment with a pathname of path.
-limit N, -li N
   specifies time limit in seconds for the absentee job.


Notes:
Control arguments and paths can be mixed freely and can appear anywhere
on the command line after the command.

Unpredictable results may occur if two absentee requests are submitted
that simultaneously attempt to compile the same segment or write into
the same absout segment.


If -queue is not specified, the request is submitted into the default
absentee priority queue defined by the site and, if requested, the
listing files is dprinted in the default queue of the request type
specified on the command line.  (If no request type is supplied, the
"printer" request type is used.)

If -queue is specified, the listing files are dprinted in the same
queue as is used for the absentee request.  If the request type
specified for dprinting does not have that queue, the highest numbered
queue available for the request type is used and a warning is issued.
