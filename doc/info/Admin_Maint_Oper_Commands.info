         dumped is to be purged using the values set with the
         set_volume_log command.


display_pvolog:

Make the following change for the "display_pvolog" command.

pg 7-9;  add the following control argument.

     -header, -he
         specifies to display the header (Default).

         the dump, and processing statistics are to be displayed.

     -header, -he
         specifies that the dump volumes will be displayed with the
         output header (Default).


     -label, -lbl
         specifies that the disk label information stored at the
         time of the dump is to be displayed.

     -no_label, -nlbl
         specifies that the disk label information stored at the
         time of the dump is not to be displayed.

     -status, -st

     argument.

pg 7-17; change the description of the "-test" control argument to read
     as follows.

         No databases are affected except for pvolog locks which
         are reset.


pg 7-18;  replace the NOTES section with the following.

     After purging, two reload groups are left in a volume log
     unless the number of reload groups has been changed (see the
     set_volume_log command).  A reload group consists of the
     following:  all incremental volume dumps not superseded by
     consolidated volume dumps; all incremental and consolidated
     volume dumps not superseded by a complete volume dump; and a
     complete volume dump.  By default all consolidated dumps and
     those incremental dumps which are not superseded by a complete
     dump are retained.  To modify the number of incremental and
     consolidated dump sets retained see the -incr_sets and
     -cons_sets control arguments of the set_volume_log command.


set_volume_log:

Make the following changes for the "set_volume_log" command.

pg 7-24; replace the CONTROL ARGUMENTS and NOTES sections with the
     following.


     Control arguments:
     -cons_sets SET_VALUE, -cs SET_VALUE
         sets the number of consolidated dump volume sets to retain
         in the volume log whenever it is purged.  The value of
         SET_VALUE may be a non-zero positive integer or the word
         "all" or the letter "a".  A consolidated dump set is
         defined as all volumes that are used in one cycle of the
         consolidated volume dumper.  By default all consolidated
         dump volumes are kept for each reload group.  The default
         operation will result if the SET_VALUE is set to "all" or
         "a".  See the "Notes" section for further explanation of
         the rules on how volume sets are retained or purged.


     -incr_sets SET_VALUE, -is SET_VALUE
         sets the number of incremental dump volume sets to retain
         in the volume log whenever it is purged.  The value of
         SET_VALUE may be a non-zero positive integer or the word
         "all" or the letter "a".  An incremental dump set is
         defined as all volumes that are used in all cycles of the
         incremental volume dumper that take place between cycles
         of the consolidated volume dumper.  By default all
         incremental dump volumes are kept for each reload group.
         The default operation will result if the SET_VALUE is set
         to "all" or "a".  See the "Notes" section for further
         explanation of the rules on how volume sets are retained
         or purged.


     -reload_groups N, -rg N
         sets the number of reload groups to N, where N>1.  The
         default value, to be set at volume log creation, is 2.  (A
         reload group consists of the following:  all incremental
         volume dumps not superseded by consolidated volume dumps;
         all incremental and consolidated volume dumps not
         superseded by a complete volume dump; and a complete
         volume dump.)


     Notes:

     1) All incremental volume sets are retained by default and are
        purged when the reload group they are in is purged.  This
        default operation is set up when the volume log is created.
        This default operation can also be set with the following
        command line:

        set_volume_log vlname -is all -cs all -reload_groups 2

        When the incr_sets (-is) value is a non-zero positive
        integer, then that number of incremental volume sets are
        retained.  All other incremental volume sets are purged,
        even if they are in the current reload group.


     2) All consolidated volume sets are retained by default and
        are purged when the reload group they are in is purged.
        This default operation is set up when the volume log is
        created and can also be set up with the following command
        line:

        set_volume_log vlname -is all -cs all -reload_groups 2

        No consolidated volume sets are purged in the current
        reload group.  Using the number of consolidated dump sets
        in all reload groups, consolidated volume sets are purged
        from previous reload groups to satisfy the value given with
        the -cons_sets (-cs) option (if this value is a non-zero
        positive integer).


     3) No incremental or consolidated volume set is retained if it
        exists outside of the configured number of reload groups.
        If it is desired to keep more consolidated or incremental
        volumes sets, the number of reload groups must be
        increased.


     Examples:

     1. set_volume_log vlname -is 1 -cs 5 -reload_groups 8

        This will be the result on the Wednesday before the
        consolidated dump of the eighth week assuming, you are
        running less incremental runs than consolidated runs,
        consolidated runs are done once per day (M-F), and a
        complete is run on Saturday.

        consolidated runs are done once per day (M-F), and a

     3. set_volume_log vlname -incr_sets 2 -cons_sets 10
        -reload_groups 2

        This will be the result on the Wednesday before the
        consolidated dump of the second week.  The consolidated
        runs are done once per day (M-F) and a complete is run on
        Saturday.

        group    SA    SN    MN    TU    WD    TH    FR

               |------incr------||incr||incr...
                           |cons||cons|


        Notice that there are only 7 consolidated volume sets at
        this point in the week.  This is restricted by the number
        of reload groups specified (i.e.  2).  If a full set of 10
        consolidated dumps is desired at all times, then 3 reload
        groups must be configured (as in the following example).


     4. set_volume_log vlname -incr_sets 2 -cons_sets 10
        -reload_groups 3

        This will be the result on the Wednesday before the
        consolidated dump of the second week.  Again, consolidated
        runs are done once per day (M-F) and a complete is run on
        Saturday.
