01/07/81  Severity Indicators


Severity indicators can be thought of as integers that represent the highest
level of error encountered in the invocation of a command or exec_com.
They are usually referenced by the same name as the command or exec_com
and are described in documentation under the heading of "Severity."

The severity command or active function can be used to display or test
the value of a specified severity indicator.  The
set_severity_indicator command can be used to assign a value to a
severity indicator from command level.  This is useful in exec_coms
that wish to implement severity indicators.


Severity Indicators in PL/I:  In PL/I a severity indicator X is
referenced by declaring an external fixed bin (35) variable with the
name X_severity_.  For example:

dcl X_severity_ fixed bin (35) ext;
X_severity_ = 0;


Severity Indicators in FORTRAN:  In FORTRAN a severity indicator X is
referenced by declaring a labelled common block with the name
X_severity_.  For example:

integer a
common /X_severity_/a
a = 0


Severity Indicators in command language:  In the command language of Multics
severity indicators can be referenced using the severity command/active
function and set using the set_severity_indicator command.  For example to set
and then display the severity indicator X the user would enter:

set_severity_indicator X 12
severity X

and the value of 12 would be displayed.
