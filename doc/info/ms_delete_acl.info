03/01/84  ms_delete_acl, msda

Syntax:  msda path {access_names}


Function:  deletes entries from the access control list (ACL) of a
given queue message segment.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a queue.  The ms suffix is assumed.  The star
   convention is allowed.
access_names
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  If
   all three components are present, the ACL entry with that name is
   deleted.  If one or more components is missing, all ACL entries with
   matching names are deleted.  (The matching strategy is described
   below under "Notes.") If no access control name is specified, the
   user's Person_id and current Project_id are assumed.  If the access
   control name is -all or -a, all ACL entries are deleted except the
   ones for *.SysDaemon.* and *.*.*.


Access required: The user must have modify permission on the
containing directory.  ACL entries for *.SysDaemon.* and *.*.* cannot
be deleted.


Notes: The matching strategy for access control names is--

o  A literal component name, including "*", matches only a component of
   the same name.
o  A missing component name not delimited by a period is taken to
   be a literal "*" (e.g., "*.Multics" is treated as "*.Multics.*").
o  Missing components on the left must be delimited by periods.
o  A missing component name delimited by a period matches any component
   name.
