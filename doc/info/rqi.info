10/11/88  request_info, rqi


Syntax as a command:  rqi type info_keys {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [rqi type info_keys {-control_args}]


Function:  Prints or returns specific information about related
request(s) in a request queue.


Arguments:
type
   is the request type specifying which request queue to search.  Valid
   request types are absentee (abs), retrieval (retv), imft, io,
   output (out), or any specific output request type (eg, printer).
info_keys
   is one or more keywords, separated by a space, specifying the
   information requested (See sections below whose titles begin with
   "List of keywords").


Control arguments:
-admin {User_id}, -am {User_id}
   selects the requests of all users or of the user specified by
   User_id.  Default is to select only your own requests.  (See
   "Access Required and Notes below.")
-all, -a
   searches all queues.  This control argument is incompatible with
   -queue.
-deferred_indefinitely, -dfi
   selects only requests that are deferred indefinitely.  Such requests
   are not run until the operator releases them.  This control argument
   may be used with the absentee request type only.


-destination STR, -ds STR
   selects requests that are queued for transfer to the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.  This control argument may only be used
   with the imft request type keyword.
-entry STR, -et STR
   selects only requests whose entrynames match STR.  You can use the
   star convention.  Directory portions of request pathnames are
   ignored when selecting requests.
-foreground, -fg
   searches only the foreground queue.  (see -queue).  This control
   argument may only be used with the absentee request type keyword.


-forms {STR}
   selects only requests which specify output forms.  If you specify
   STR, only requests matching STR will be chosen.  This control
   argument may be used with the output or any specific output request
   type only.
-id ID
   selects only requests whose identifier matches the specified ID.


-immediate, -im
   selects only requests that can be run immediately upon reaching the
   heads of their respective queues.  This excludes requests deferred
   indefinitely, requests deferred until a specific time, or requests
   that have reached the head of the queue and have been deferred by
   the system because their CPU time limits are higher than the maximum
   for the current shift; but it includes requests deferred because of
   load control or resource unavailability, because those conditions
   could change at any time.  This control argument may be used with
   all request types except retrieval.
-pathname PATH, -pn PATH, -p PATH
   selects only the requests matching PATH, where PATH may be an
   absolute pathname or relative pathname.  You can use the star
   convention.  Use of this control argument is incompatible with -et.


-queue N, -q N
   searches only queue N.  If you do not give -q, all queues are
   searched but nothing is printed for queues from which no requests
   are selected.  For convenience in writing exec_coms and
   abbreviations, the word "foreground" ("fg") following -q is
   equivalent to -fg.
-resource {STR}, -rsc {STR}
   selects only requests having a resource requirement.  If you specify
   STR, only requests whose resource descriptions containing that
   string are chosen.  This control argument may only be used with the
   absentee request type keyword.


-sender STR
   selects only requests from sender STR.  You must specify one or more
   request identifiers.  In most cases, the sender is an RJE station
   identifier.  This control argument may be used with the absentee
   request type only.
-source STR, -sc STR
   selects requests that are queued for transfer from the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.  If neither -destination nor -source is
   specified, the default is -destination imft.  This control argument
   may only be used with the imft request type keyword.
-user User_id
   selects only requests entered by the specified user.  (see "Access
   Required and Notes below").


Access required:  You must have o access to the queue(s).  You must
have r extended access to the queue(s) to use -am, or -user, since it
is necessary to read all requests in the queue(s) to select those
entered by a specified user.


Notes:  All queues are searched for your requests by default.  Nothing
is printed for queues from which no requests are chosen.

When a user name is specified, with either the -admin or -user control
arguments, then proxy requests are selected if either the user who
entered the request, or the proxy user on whose behalf it was entered,
matches the specified user name.

The final entryname portion of PATH given with -pn argument, the
entryname given with -et, and the RJE station name specified after
-sender can be star names.

If the info_key keyword is inconsistent with the type keyword, an
error message is displayed.  (See sections below whose titles begin
with "List of keywords")


The User_id arguments selected after -am or -user can have any of the
following forms:

       Person_id.Project_id   matches that user only
       Person_id.*            matches that person on any project
       Person_id              same as Person_id.*
       *.Project_id           matches any user on that project
       .Project_id            same as *.Project_id
       *.*                    same as -am with no User_id following it
