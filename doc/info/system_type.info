Syntax:  system_type {SystemName}


Syntax as active function:  [system_type {SystemName}]


Function:	 prints the canonical system type name either for the running
system or for a user-specified system type.  As an active function, it
returns the system type name, rather than printing it.


Arguments:
SystemName
   is a system type name acceptable to the system_type_ subroutine.
   Its canonical name is printed.  If SystemName is not supplied, the
   canonical name for the system type of the running system is printed.


Notes:  In order to avoid embedding knowledge of the canonical names
for system types in exec_coms, the system_type active function should
always be used first to canonicalize any name being compared with.  For
instance, in this example, system_type is used to compare the canonical
name for "6180" against the type of the running system:

     &if [equal [system_type] [system_type 6180]] &then logout -brief
