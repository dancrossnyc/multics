Syntax:  test_tape {-control_args}


Function:  tests a tape drive or tape reel.


Control arguments:
-volume ID, -vol ID
   specifies a tape by its volume identification number, which can have
   a maximum of nine characters.  If -volume is not given, a default of
   "test_tape" is used.
-comment STR, -com STR
   allows you to pass additional information about the requested volume
   mount to the operator.
-device STR, -dv STR
   selects a specific tape unit; STR must be the complete device name.
   If this control argument is not given, the system finds a free tape
   unit (e.g., -device tapb_08).  It is incompatible with -compare.


-compare STR, -comp STR
   writes and then reads a tape on device STR1, and then automatically
   has the operator mount the tape on device STR2 and read the tape.
   The mounting and reading continues to device STRn.  At least two
   devices must be specified.  Only one device is attached at a time.
   The full device name (e.g., -comp tapa_05 tapa_07) must be used.
   This control argument cannot be used with -device.
-density N, -den N
   indicates the tape density, where N can be either 6250, 1600, or
   800.  The default is 1600.
-track7, -tk7
   specifies a 7-track tape drive as the test unit.  The default is 9
   track.


-wait N, -wt N
   attempts to attach the device N times, after one-minute waits, if
   the device desired is being used by another process.  If after N
   waits the device still cannot be attached, the program bypasses the
   device.  The default for N is two times.
-count N, -ct N
   indicates the number of records to be written or read, where N is a
   decimal integer.  Each write operation creates one 1040-word
   physical record.  If -count is not given, then the entire tape is
   written or read.
-no_data_compare, -ndc
   disables comparison of the data read to a known pattern.  This
   control argument is useful for verifying that a tape can be read
   without knowing what data is on the tape.


-random
   fills the data buffers with a known random data pattern.  It cannot
   be used with -pattern.
-pattern N, -ptrn N
   specifies N as the word of octal data to fill the data buffers,
   where N can be a maximum of 12 octal digits.  If fewer than 12
   digits are given, the field is padded on the left with zeroes.  If
   -pattern is not given, a pattern of 222222222222 is used.  This
   control argument cannot be used with -random.
-write_read, -wr
   identifies the mode of the test.  The tape is written and the read
   pass is performed.  (Default)


-write, -w
   identifies the mode of the test.  The tape is written and the read
   pass is bypassed.
-read, -r
   identifies the mode of the test.  The tape is mounted without a
   write ring and the read-only pass is preformed.
-raw
   displays raw hex detailed status with each error message in addition
   to an interpreted display.


Notes:  This command senses the End of Tape Mark (EOT) and stops even
if the record count has not been exhausted.  Typing test_tape with no
control arguments has the same effect as:

   test_tape -vol test-tape -den 1600 -ct 100000 -ptrn 222222222222 -wr


Listed below is a summary of the default control argument values.

-volume    (test-tape)                 -count    (100000{entire tape})
-comment   (NONE)		         -ndc      (OFF)
-device    (one previously assigned,   -random   (OFF)
           or a free device)	         -pattern  (222222222222)
-compare   (OFF)		         -write    (ON)
-density   (1600)		         -read     (ON)
-track     (9)		         -raw      (OFF)
-wait      (OFF)
