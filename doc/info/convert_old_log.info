Syntax:  convert_old_log OLD_LOG {-control_args}


Function: Moves the information in a family of old (syslog/write_log_)
log segments to a new format log family.


Arguments:
OLD_LOG
   is the pathname of the first segment (most recent) of a syslog
   family.


Control arguments:
-old_history_dir DIR, -ohd DIR
   Specifies that older segments in the family are to be found in DIR.
   The default is >udd>sa>a>history.
-new_dir DIR, -nd DIR
   Specified that the current live log segment for this log is located
   in the directory DIR.  If there is no current live log segment,
   special actions specified under "notes" below are needed.  The
   default is >sc1>as_logs>LOG_NAME.
-new_history_dir DIR, -nhd DIR
   Specifies that the converted information is to be put in segments
   in the directory dir.  The default is >udd>sa>a>history.


Access required: This requires r to the old logs, sma to the new
history dir, and rw to the live log segment.


Notes:
This command creates as many new log segments in the new history dir
as needed to contain all the old information.  Then it sets the
previous log pathname in the oldest segment of the live log family to
the history dir.

The command chases through the headers of the old format logs and will
collect pointers of up to 200 logs.  Once it cannot find the previous
log, the conversion starts with the oldest log.  As each old log is
converted, a message displays the entry name.

If an old log is found to be damaged, the command will stop with an
error message to this effect.  The damaged log can be manually patched
up or moved out so that it cannot be found by the previous log
chaining.  Then just reenter the command.


If the previous chain is broken, just add the name of the log family
to the newest of the unconverted logs and then enter the same command
line in again.

If there is no live log segment family, the pathname cannot be set.
You will have to use the set_log_history_dir command to set it.  If
there will never be a live log, you should rename the segment with the
most recent timestamp in its name created in the new history dir to
have the name LOG instead of LOG.TIMESTAMP.

The conversion will require at most the same amount of quota that the
old logs occupy.  In general the new logs format allows the converted
logs to occupy less quota.


Examples:  convert_old_log >sc1>log
