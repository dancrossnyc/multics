02/11/85  delete_iacl_seg, dis

Syntax as a command:  dis path {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function: deletes entries from a segment initial access control list
(initial ACL) in a specified directory.  A segment initial ACL contains
the ACL entries to be placed on segments created in the specified
directory.  (See IACL.gi.)


Arguments:
path
   specifies the pathname of a directory whose segment initial ACL is
   to be changed.  If it is -working_directory (-wd) or omitted, your
   working directory is assumed.  The star convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   entries in the directory initial ACL that match the User_ids are
   deleted.  (For a description of the matching strategy, see the
   set_acl command.)  If you give no User_ids, your Person_id and
   current Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes the entire initial ACL except an entry for *.SysDaemon.*.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the messages "User name not on ACL of path" and "Empty
   initial ACL."
-ring N, -rg N
   identifies the ring number whose directory initial ACL is to be
   deleted.  It can appear anywhere on the line and affects the whole
   line.  If present, follow it by N (where 0 <= N <= 7).  If not
   given, your ring is assumed.


Access required: Your must have modify (m) permission on the
directory.
