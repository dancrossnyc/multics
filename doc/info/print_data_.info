:Entry: print_data_: 06/30/86  print_data_

Function: formats and prints the output of a PL/I put data statement.
The output switch for printing may be specified, as well as various
formatting options.

Syntax:
declare print_data_ entry (char (*) varying, ptr, fixed bin (35));
call print_data_ (put_data_string, print_data_info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
put_data_string
   is the output of a PL/I put data statement.  Usually obtained as
   follows:  put data (xxx) string (put_data_string), where xxx is a
   structure whose values are to be formatted and printed.  (Input)
print_data_info_ptr
   is a pointer to a structure which describes the formatting options
   to be used for printing the input.  See Notes below.  (Input)
code
   is a system status code.  (Output)


:Entry: rs: 06/30/86  rs

Function: formats the output of a PL/I put data statement.  The result
is returned in a string.  Various formatting options may be specified.

Syntax:
declare print_data_$rs entry (char (*) varying, ptr, char (*) varying,
			fixed bin (35));
call print_data_$rs (put_data_string, print_data_info_ptr,
			return_string, code);


Arguments:
put_data_string
   is the output of a PL/I put data statement.  Usually obtained as
   follows:  put data (xxx) string (put_data_string), where xxx is a
   structure whose values are to be formatted and printed.  (Input)
print_data_info_ptr
   is a pointer to a structure which describes the formatting options
   to be used for printing the input.  See Notes below.  (Input)
return_string
   is a string in which the output is returned.  (Input/Output)
code
   is a system status code.  (Output)


Notes: The include file pointed to by print_data_info_ptr is declared
in print_data_info.incl.pl1 as follows:

dcl print_data_info_version_1 fixed bin options (constant) init (1)
				internal static;

dcl	print_data_info_ptr		ptr;
dcl	1 print_data_info		based (print_data_info_ptr),
	  2 version		fixed bin,
	  2 indentation		fixed bin,
	  2 value_column		fixed bin,
	  2 output_switch		ptr,
	  2 flags,
	    3 octal		bit (1) unal,
	    3 hex			bit (1) unal,
	    3 pad			bit (34) unaligned,
	  2 intervals		char (256) varying;


where:

version
   is the version of this structure.  It should be set to
   print_data_info_version_1.
indentation
   is the number of spaces by which structure level names are indented.
value_column
   is the column in which the printing of values begins.  The structure
   names are indented, but the values all begin in the same column, so
   this value should allow a reasonable amount of space for structure
   names so they don't overlap the values column.
output_switch
   is the output switch to use.  This is ignored for the rs entry.  If
   it is null then user_output is used.


octal
   specifies that bit string values should be converted to octal.  This
   is incompatible with the hex flag.  The bit string value must be an
   integral multiple of 3 bits long in order to be converted, otherwise
   it is not converted.
hex
   specifies that bit string values should be converted to hexadecimal.
   This is incompatible with the octal flag.  The bit string value must
   be an integral multiple of 4 bits long in order to be converted,
   otherwise it is not converted.
intervals
   is not currently supported and must be set to the null string ("").
