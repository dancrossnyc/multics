05/31/83  Mailing lists

A mailing list is an ASCII segment or archive component which contains
one or more addresses.  When mail is sent to a mailing list, it is
delivered to each of the addresses in the list.  The members of a
mailing list may themselves be other mailing lists.  Although a mailing
list is composed of multiple addresses, all mail system operations
treat it as a single address.


Format of a mailing list:
A segment or archive component must have the suffix "mls" in order to
be used as a mailing list.  

The mailing list segment or archive component contains the printed
representations of its member addresses.  For a description of the
acceptable printed representations of an address, type:
     help addresses.gi -section printed representations

If multiple addresses are given on a single line in the mailing list,
they must be separated by commas; however, the comma at the end of a
line is optional.  The last line of the mailing list must not end with
a comma.


Example:
The following is a valid mailing list:

     Palter.Multics, Sibert.Multics,
     {save >udd>SiteSA>PKelley>PKelley.mlsys>outgoing},
     Mail-Enthusiasts at MIT-MC


Command/request line format:
The following control argument is used on a command/request line to
specify a mailing list address:

-mailing_list path,
-mls path
   specifies the pathname of a mailing list.  The suffix "mls" is added
   if necessary.  The archive component pathname convention is accepted.


Message header format:
The following text is used in message headers to represent a mailing
list address:

{list path}
   identifies a mailing list by pathname.  Path is the absolute
   pathname of the mailing list segment or archive component excluding
   the suffix "mls".
