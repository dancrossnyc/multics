Description

0074  phx20783
If an error code other than error_table_$noentry is returned from the
dprint_$queue_contents, then the displayed queue contents uses an
uninitialized variable, yielding incorrect queue statistics.

0073  phx20789
l(a d)r is not listing moved requests when requests are moved with the
-admin or -user options.

0072  phx20784
If a station tries to login to a line already in use, proper cleanup
is not made so that the line can be reattached.

0069  phx15162
Moving IMFT requests from one queue to another can sometimes cause the
requests to be transmitted twice.

0068  phx14542
Under certain circumstances, two I/O Drivers serving the same request
type can each print the same requests, thus double-printing each
segment.  Halting the drivers and giving them a ready seems to clear
up the problem.

0066  phx09001
When a buffer of data is written by the ibm3780 I/O module in
multi_record mode and the buffer contains 509 or more characters the
block of data gets split arbitrarily by the bisync_ I/O module.

0064  phx03664
The spooler is supplying a canned no to ALL questions asked by
tape_ansi_ (or tape_ibm_ or whoever).  It should only answer "no" to
those questions it understands and should pass on the rest.

0063  phx02562
The Card_Input Daemon terminates with message "No unclaimed signal
handler specified for thie process" if it has no access to the user's
card_input.acs and the ++EOF card does not occur within a few hundred
cards.

0059  phx13732
 The dprint and enter_output_request commands attempt to initiate the
 file being printed and call object_info_ if successful to check if it
 is an object segment.  However, when used in the Initializer's
 process, the initiate will succeed for multi-segment files causing
 object_info_ to take a fault.  The commands should use the file type
 previously determined by a call to hcs_$status_long as the criteria
 to control the object segment check.

0057  phx13435
 Due to remote_printer_'s interpretation that "^non_edited" mode is
 equivalent to "default", it is not possible to connect a printer to
 the I/O daemon using tty_printer_ whose terminal modes specify
 "rawo".  As a result, use of the "force_ctl_char" feature of the
 I/O daemon will not work without the bypass given in the TR.

0056  phx13435
 The printer modes listed by "req_status -long" do not reflect the
 actual modes that will be in effect when the request is printed.

0053  phx13443
 The error message printed by enter_output_request when the default
 request type for printing, punching, or plotting is not defined is
 confusing in that it never states the the request type is undefined.

0052  phx13443
 The print_request_types command will list the default request types
 -- printer, punch, plotter -- even if they are not defined in the
 I/O daemon tables.

0050  phx13354
 The enter_output_request command should accept "-forms" for punch
 and plotter request types.  Additionally, the dpunch command
 should accept "-forms".

0048  phx12867
 Until the standard I/O daemon software supports forms names (see
 entry 0049 on this list), the standard I/O daemon drivers should
 defer any requests with non-blank forms names as they can not process
 these requests properly.  If the drivers could determine that a
 non-standard driver will never see the request, they should cancel it
 outright; however, that's probably impossible to implement.

0047  phx06540
 Specifying the absout name via ++RJECONTROL expands the pathname given
 for the absout file with respect to the I/O daemon's home directory
 rather than the user's home directory.  Due to the nature of the
 ++RJECONTROL card, the only mechanism which can be used to correct
 this problem is to add a new control card called ++ABSOUT with syntax
 similar to the ++ABSIN card.

0044  phx05404
 The coordinator should check the DTCM of each component of an MSF to
 see if it is greater than the time printed when deciding whether the
 MSF can be safely deleted.  In order to insure these DTCMs are
 correct, dprint_ should perform an hcs_$status_ call on each component
 to fix their DTCMs.

0043  phx11647
 If the copy_cards command can not find the requested deck and a new
 deck name is supplied, the error message will contain garbage.

0040  phx11767
 If the "-htab" attach argument is used with tty_printer_, the I/O
 module will force "tabs" mode on the lower-level I/O module.
 tty_printer_ should not do this and should rely on the lower-level
 module to properly handle the tabs that tty_printer_ sends it.

0027  phx06609
 validate_card_input_ performs its access checks using the user
 name and project name supplied on the ++DATA or ++RJE cards which
 might be aliases; it should first translate these identifiers to
 avoid using aliases.

0021  phx07964
 On reinitialization, the coordinator will delete all files
 scheduled for deletion after printing/punching even if the
 delete-time specified by the site in the iod_tables has not yet
 passed for the file.  The delete-time should always be honored.

0020  phx02646
 If a "clean_cards" command issued from a card input daemon
 causes the pool directory to be deleted, subsequent "read_card"
 commands will fail because the pool is no longer initialized;
 this situation should be detected and the daemon should
 reinitialize the card pool.

0019  phx09955
 The dprint command does not print the "N requests queued..."
 message if an invalid control argument is encountered on the
 command line after pathnames which are successfully processed.

0018  phx09937
 Non-canonical segments can not be printed using standard I/O
 daemon software.  When (and if) prt_conv_ is rewritten in PL/I,
 it should be upgraded at that time to support non-canonical
 data.

0015  phx09556
 In MCC mode, non-ASCII characters are punched as random garbage
 rather than as NULs (no punches).

0014  phx09556
 In MCC mode, the DEL (\177) character is not punched on output
 and the card code defined in the RefGuide to represent DEL is not
 recognized on input.

0008  phx09042
 When reading cards, the daemon ignores "Dual Read Alert".  It
 should halt, print a message requesting the bad card be retried,
 and wait for operator intervention.  (This problem also occurs
 for other status indicators.)

0002  phx06810
 During coordinator initialization, the error message printed
 when creating "coord_dir" should indicate that the required
 quota was 250 records.  Further, this message should appear in
 the error message documentation.
