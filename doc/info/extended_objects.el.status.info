Description

22  
switch_(on off) will not work with non-standard switches of extended
objects.

13  
standard objects (seg, dir, msf, dm file) don't return suffix_info
flags correctly.  flags for all should be:  suffix_info.standard = "1"b
and suffix_info.extended_acl = "0"b.

12  
suffix_XXX_ must return "0"b for suffix_info.standard_object and "1"b
for suffix_info.extended_acl if it uses extended acls.  failure to set
standard_object to "0" for all suffix_XXX_$suffix_info and extended_acl
to "1"b for thise types that use extended acl will cause acl_commands_
to refuse to work in many different situations.

11  
status blows up when reporting about DM files when it tries to free
storage through a null pointer.

fs_copy_util_ does not check for consistency in the original MSF when
copying to the new MSF.  if component 0 does not exist, it complains
about not finding it, but does not care about any other missing
component.
