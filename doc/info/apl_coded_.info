12/23/81  apl_coded_

This PL/1 subroutine has entry points that can be called as external
functions from within APL, for the purpose of manipulating Multics
segments as stream files.  Operations equivalent to the APL standard
file handling routines are provided, plus several which are meaningful
only in the sequential access stream file environment.


Syntax:  The syntax of each entry point is described below.


List of entry points in apl_coded_:
create
   Usage:  'path_name' CREATE file_number

   (like FCREATE).  Creates segment named 'path_name' and opens it
   for stream i/o.  Path_name may be relative or absolute.  File
   number is analogous to 'tie number' in APL files but the two
   systems are independent.  (That is, you may have a stream file 7
   and an APL file 7 tied concurrently. )
eof
   Usage:  R <- EOF file_number_vector

   Returns boolean vector of 'end-of-file' status for each file
   specified.  EOF becomes true when the last character in a file has
   been read. 


nums
   Usage:  R <- NUMS

   (like FNUMS).  Returns vector of tied file numbers. 
position
   Usage:  type [,skip] POSITION file_number

    Repositions the file.  If 'type' is -1, the file is rewound.  If
    type is 0, 'skip' lines are skipped.  If 'type' is 1, the file is
    positioned after the last line.  If 'type' is 2, the file is
    positioned at the 'skip'th character.  If 'type' is 3, 'skip'
    characters are skipped.  'skip' is ignored if 'type' is -1 or 1.
    'skip' may be negative if 'type' is 0 or 3, in which case a
    backward skip is performed.  If 'skip' is omitted, 1 is assumed.


read
   Usage:  R <- no_of_lines READ file_number

    Returns character matrix of dimension [I J] where I is the number
    of lines actually read (I<=left argument) and J is the length of
    the longest line (J<=512).  Lines containing less than J characters
    are right-padded with blanks.
rewind
   Usage:  REWIND file_number_vector

    Positions each file specified in right argument so that next READ
    operation would read first line in file or next WRITE operation
    would truncate and replace file contents with the new data.


tie
   Usage:  'path_name' TIE file_number

   (like FTIE).  Opens segment named 'path_name' and opens it for
   stream i/o.  Path_name may be relative or absolute. 
untie
   Usage:  UNTIE file_number_vector

   (like FUNTIE).  Detaches each file in right argument. 
write
   Usage:  'char_vector' WRITE file_number

   Writes the characters of the left argument to the designated
   stream file.  Newline characters (octal escape "012) must be
   included explicitly if desired.
