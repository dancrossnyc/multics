09/10/87  hpset_dir_ring_brackets, hpsdrb

Syntax:  hpsdrb path {optional_args}


Function: allows system administrators to modify the ring brackets of
any directory, including directories whose ring brackets are 0,0.
This command operates on directories whose ring brackets prevent them
from being operated on by the set_dir_ring_brackets command.  To use
this command, a system administrator must have access to the highly
privileged gate hphcs_.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the directory whose ring
   brackets are to be modified.
rb1
   is the number to be used as the first ring bracket of the directory.
   See "Notes" below.
rb2
   is the number to be used as the second ring bracket of the
   directory.  See "Notes" below.


Notes:  If rb2 is omitted, the ring bracket is set to rb1.  If rb1 and
rb2 are omitted, they are set to the user's current validation level.
The ring brackets must be in the allowable range 0 through 7 and must
have the ordering: rb1 < rb2.
