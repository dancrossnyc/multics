02/21/84  daily_summary

Syntax:  daily_summary {-control_args}


Function: allows system administrators to print a summary of system
usage for the current billing period and a list of projects with
overspent accounts.  It also places a flag in the SAT for each project
that has an overspent account or has passed its termination date.


Control arguments:
-nocutr
   do not print a list of projects to be cutoff.
-nosat
   do not flag SAT entries.
-nosum
   do not print a system usage summary.
-warn
   for all projects to be cutoff, use a warning flag that permits users
   to login.


Notes:  The segments reqfile and smf.cur.sat are assumed to be present
in the working directory and are implicit inputs to the daily_summary
command.

This command writes the system usage of each project in the reqfile on
the sumry I/O switch.  The usage figures are cumulative from the time
that billing was last run.  It also writes a list of projects that have
run out of funds or are past the termination date and flags their SAT
entries on the cutrpt I/O switch.


The information about the closeness of a project to its limits, that is
used to decide whether to print a cutoff warning message when users on
the project log in, is placed in the SAT by this command.

The cutrpt and sumry I/O switches must be attached by the caller.
