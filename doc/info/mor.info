02/18/85  move_output_request, mor

Syntax as a command:  mor request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function: moves a request from one I/O daemon queue to another.  The
move can be within the same request type or from one request type to
another.  The request is always placed at the end of the target queue.


Arguments:
request_identifiers
   can be chosen from the following:
   path
      identifies a request to be moved by the full or relative pathname
      of the input data segment.  The star convention is allowed.
   -entry STR, -et STR
      identifies a request to be moved by STR, the entryname portion of
      the input data segment pathname.  The star convention is allowed.
   -id ID
      identifies one or more requests to be moved by request
      identifier.  This identifier may be used to further define any
      path or -entry identifier (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   searches all queues for the requests to be moved.  The target queue
   is not searched by -all if the source and target request types are
   identical.  This control argument is incompatible with -queue.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling the user that a particular request
   identifier was not found or that requests were moved when using star
   names or the -all control argument.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies that queue N for the given request type contains the
   request to be moved, where N is an integer specifying the number for
   the queue.  If you omit -queue, all the queues are searched.


-print, -pr
   specifies that the request moved is found in the queue(s) associated
   with the default printer request type (see "Notes").
-punch, -pch
   specifies that the request moved is found in the queue(s) associated
   with the default punch request type (see "Notes").
-plot
   specifies that the request moved is found in the queue(s) associated
   with the default plotter request type (see "Notes").
-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   specifies that the request moved is found in the queue(s) for the
   request type identified by STR.  Use the print_request_types command
   to list request types.  (See "Notes.")


-to_queue N, -tq N
   specifies which queue to move the request to.  If not given, the
   default queue of the target request type is used.
-to_request_type STR, -to_rqt STR
   specifies that the request should be moved to request type STR.  If
   you don't give -to_request_type, the original request type is used.
   The target request types must be of the same generic type as the
   original request type.


-user User_id
   specifies the name of the submitter of the requests to be moved.
   The User_id can be Person_id.Project_id, Person_id, or .Project_id.
   This control argument is primarily for the operator and
   administrators.  Both r and d extended access to the queue are
   required.  This control argument causes the command to use
   privileged message segment primitives that preserve the original
   identity of the submitter.  If the process has access isolation
   mechanism (AIM) ring 1 privilege, the AIM attributes of the original
   submitter are preserved; otherwise the AIM attributes of the current
   process are used.  (Default: to move only requests entered by the
   user executing the command)


Access required: You must have o extended access to the queue from
which the request is being taken and a access to the queue to which the
request is being moved.  You must have r and d extended access to move
a request owned by another user (see -user).


Notes: The control arguments -print, -punch, -plot, and -request_type
are mutually exclusive.  If you use none, the default request type for
enter_output_request -print (as displayed by print_request_types) is
assumed.

If you supply any path or -entry STR request identifiers, only one -id
ID request identifier are accepted and it must match any requests
selected by path or entryname.  You can specify multiple -id ID
identifiers in a single command invocation only if you give no path or
entry request identifiers.

When you use no star names and a single request identifier matches more
than one request in the queue(s) searched, none of the requests are
moved.  However, a message is printed telling how many matching
requests are found.


If the request is already running, it is not moved and a message is
printed.

See the Programmer's Reference Manual for a description of request
identifiers.
