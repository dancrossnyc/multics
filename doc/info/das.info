01/27/84  display_account_status, das

Syntax:  das {Project_id} {-control_args}


Function: allows system administrators to print the latest accounting
information for a project.  The information is stored in the PDT of
that project and is correct as of the last time the daily accounting
job was run; it is usually run every night.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project.  If this argument is not given,
   the project under which the project administrator is currently
   logged in is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints a one-line summary of the account information.
-long, -lg
   prints all information found in the projfile (project registration
   segment) entry and the reqfile (requisition segment) entry.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.


Notes:  The user must have read access to the PDT to use this command;
usually only project administrators have such access.

If neither the -brief nor -long control argument is given, all
information about charges is printed.

For more information on the projfile and reqfile entries, see MAM --
System Administrator (AK50).  See also the proj_usage_report command
to get a brief summary of each user's resource consumption and the
print_pdt command to get more detailed information about each user.
