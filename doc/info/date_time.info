02/08/85  date_time

Syntax as a command:  date_time {time_string} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
   [date_time {time_string} {DT} {-control_args}]


Function: returns a date and time value for a specified date-time or
the current date-time consisting of a date, a time from 0000.0 to
2359.9, a time zone, and a day of the week.  The date and time value is
returned as a single quoted string of the form
"mm/dd/yy  hhmm.m zzz www" (e.g., "06/01/84  0840.9 mst Fri").  The
format string to produce this is
"^my/^dm/^yc  ^Hd^99v.9MH ^xxxxza^xxxda".


Arguments:
time_string
   indicates the date_time about which information is desired.  If you
   supply no time_string, the current date and time are used.  The time
   string is concatenated to form a single argument even if it contains
   spaces; you need not quote it.  (See time_strings.gi for a
   description of valid time_string values.)


Control arguments:
-language STR, -lang STR
   STR specifies the language in which month name, day names, and zone
   names are to be expressed.  (Default: the process default)
-zone STR
   STR specifies the zone that is to be used to express the result.
   (Default: the process default)


Notes: Use the print_time_defaults command to display the default
language and zone.  Use the display_time_info command to display a list
of all acceptable language and zone values.

Due to exec_coms, etc., that have been built around the expected
date_time format, this command does not honor the process date_time
format (set by set_time_default).  You are encouraged to use "clock
date_time" in place of date_time to get the proper default handling.
