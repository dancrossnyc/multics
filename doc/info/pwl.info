10/20/86  print_wordlist, pwl


Syntax as a command:  pwl path {-control_args}


Function:  displays (prints) the words contained in a wordlist segment
in a multiple column format.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a wordlist segment.  If path does not have the
   suffix wl, one is assumed; however, wl must be the last component of
   the segment name.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppresses error messages when no words are generated in the
   wordlist (see -output-file).
-columns n, -cols n
   specifies that the output is to contain n columns.  (The default
   number of columns depends on the line length and the column width.
-column_width n, -cw n
   specifies that the column width is n characters.  (The default
   column width is 20.)


-output_file path, -of path
   directs the output to the segment specified by path in a format
   suitable for printing on a line printer.  If there are no words in
   the wordlist, the following error message is provided.  There are no
   words in the <wordlist name> wordlist and an empty wordlist is
   created unless -brief_errors was also provided.
-page_length n, -pl n specifies that the page length is n lines.  (The
   default page length is 60 if -output_file is specified; otherwise,
   it is 66.)
-vertical_margin n, -vm n
   specifies that the vertical margin size is n lines.  (The default
   vertical margin size is 0 if -output_file is specified; otherwise,
   it is 3.)


Notes:  The default number of columns is the maximum number of columns
that fit within the line length.  If the -output_file control argument
is specified, a line length of 136 is assumed.  Otherwise, the line
length defined for the user_output switch is used.  If none is defined,
a line length of 72 is assumed.


If the length of a word is greater than or equal to the column width,
the word is truncated.  An asterisk (*) is appended to such words to
indicate truncation.


Output is divided into pages.  Each page has a top and bottom vertical
margin consisting of n blank lines where n is the vertical margin size.
These lines are included in the page length.  The column height on a
page is equal to the page length minus twice the vertical margin size.
In the default case, the column height equals 60 lines whether or not
the -output_file control argument is specified.  On the last page of
output, the column height is reduced to the minimum height needed to
accommodate remaining words.  If the -output_file control argument is
specified, each page is terminated by an ASCII new page character
(octal 014).
