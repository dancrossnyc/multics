03/29/76  sort, merge

Syntax:  
     sort  input_specs  output_spec  {-control_args}
     merge input_specs  output_spec  {-control_args}


Function: Sort (Merge) one or more files
according to the values of one or more key fields.

This info file applies to both the sort and the merge;
see the section "Differences Between Sort and Merge".


Arguments: 
input_specs
   Specify each input file (up to 10) as -
     -if pathname		Pathname in Storage System, or
     -ids "attach_desc"	Attach description.

output_spec
   Specify just one output file as -
     -of pathname		Pathname in Storage System, or
     -of -replace		Replace input file by output file, or
     -ods "attach_desc"	Attach description.



Control arguments: 
     -ci		Sort (Merge) Description input via terminal, or
     -sd pathname	Pathname of Sort Description (sort command only), or
     -md pathname	Pathname of Merge Description (merge command only).
     -td pathname	Pathname of directory to contain work files;
		default is user's process directory (sort command only).
     -file_size f	Estimated total amount of data to be sorted,
		in millions of bytes (sort command only).



Examples: 
1)  sort -ci -if in -of -rp	Sort Description from user's terminal;
			input file is named in;
			output file will replace input file.
Input.			The Sort requests the Sort Description.
keys: char(10) 0;		The single key is a character string
			whose length is 10 bytes,
			and which starts at the first byte
			of the record (word 0, bit 0).
.			A line consisting of "." terminates
			the Sort Description from a terminal.

2)  sort -sd sort_desc -td >udd>pool
		 	Sort Description entered from a segment;
			work files will be contained in the
			directory >udd>pool;
			no input or output file is named.
     Assume the segment sort_desc contains -
key: bin(17) 1;		The key is fixed binary aligned, and
			occupies the second word of the record.
exits: input_file  user$input	Input_file exit procedure is user$input.
    output_file user$output;	Output_file exit procedure is user$output.

3)  sort -ids "tape_ansi_ V" -ods "record_stream_ -target vfile_ b" -ci
			Input file specified by attach description
			for a magnetic tape in ANSI format;
			output file specified to be unstructured
			(the Sort's record output will be
			transformed into stream output).

4)  merge -md merge_desc -if a.in -if b.in -of =.out
			  Merge Description entered from a segment;
			  input files are named a.in and b.in;
			  output file will be named b.out.


Syntax of the Sort (Merge) Description:
     keys:  <key_description> ... ;
     exits:  <exit_description>  ... ;
If -ci is used, the additional line "." terminates input.
There may be up to 32 keys described.


Syntax of a Key Description:
     <datatype> (<size>) <word_offset> [(<bit_offset>)] [descending]
where -
     <datatype>	Data type of a key field; can be -
		char, bit, fixed bin, float bin, dec, float dec.
     <size>	Length of the key field (in decimal),
		in units appropriate to the data type.
     <word_offset>	Offset in words from the beginning of the record.
		Words are numbered (in decimal) starting at 0.
     <bit_offset>	Offset in bits from the beginning of the word.
		Bits are numbered (in decimal) starting at 0.
     descending	Rank in descending order for this key field.


Syntax of an Exit Description:
     <exit_name>  <user_name>
where -
     <exit_name>	Name of the exit point -
	input_file	(sort command only)
	output_file	(sort command only)
	compare
	input_record	(sort command only
	output_record

      <user_name>	Name of the entry point of the user procedure,
		in the same form as a command name.


Writing an Exit Procedure:
See the MPM descriptions of the subroutines sort_ and merge_
for a complete description of how to write a user exit procedure;
or type "help sort_" or "help merge_" for a summary.


Functions:
Sort or merge one or more files of records which are not ordered,
to create a new file of ordered (or "ranked") records.


Files Supported:
An input or output file can be specified
either by a pathname or by an attach description.
Its organization must be structured (record I/O is used).
Records can be either fixed length or variable length.
If the user names an input file or an output file,
it must be in the Multics Storage System.
(It can be either a segment or a multisegment file.)
If the user supplies an attach description,
any I/O module available at the installation can be used,
provided it supports sequential record I/O.


Input:  The user can specify up to 10 input files.
The organization can be either sequential or indexed.
Alternatively, the user must name an input_file exit procedure,
which is then responsible for releasing records to the Sort.


Output:  The user can specify one output file.
The organization must be sequential.
Alternatively, the user must name an output_file exit procedure,
which is then responsible for retrieving records
(ranked by the Sort) from the Sort.


Sort Description:
In addition to the arguments to the sort or merge command,
a Sort (Merge) Description is necessary
to specialize the Sort (Merge) for a particular execution.
It can be supplied either via the user's terminal, or via a segment.
A Sort Description can include the following statements -
     keys		Specifies key fields, used for ranking records.
     exits	Names user-written exit procedures.


Keys Statement:  Up to 32 key fields can be specified.
Use any PL/I data type - except varying string, complex, or pictured.
Ordering can be ascending, descending, or mixed.
The original order of records with equal keys is preserved.

If key fields are not described via the keys statement,
then the user must name a compare exit procedure.


Exits Statement:  User-written "exit procedures" can be supplied
at specific points in the sorting process.
The following exits are supported:
     input_file	Reads input file, releases records to the sort.
     output_file	Receives records in ranked order, writes output file.
     compare	Compares two records, decides which ranks first.
     input_record	Process each input record (delete, insert, or alter).
     output_record	Process each output record (delete, insert, alter,
		or summarize data).


Differences Between Sort and Merge:
The merge command has the following restrictions -
1)  -replace cannot be used for the output file.
2)  -td and -file_size cannot be specified.
3)  The following exit points are not provided -
	input_file
	output_file
	input_record
