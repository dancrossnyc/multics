Syntax:  lnac {path {User_id}} {-control_args}


Function: scans a directory and lists segments and directories to which
a specified User_id does not have a given access condition.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the directory to be scanned.  If you omit path or
   give -working_directory (-wd), your working directory is scanned.
User_id
   is an access control name that can have null components.  If you
   omit it, your process's User_id is assumed.  The star convention
   is allowed.  (See the set_acl command.)


Control arguments:
-dir_mode STR
   lists directories to which the user does not have STR mode; STR can
   be any or all of the letters sma.
-seg_mode STR
   lists segments to which the user does not have STR mode; STR can be
   any or all of the letters rew.


Access required:  You must have status permission on the directory.


Notes:
You can't use User_id unless you have first supplied a path.

If no control arguments are given, the command lists all
segments and directories to which the user has null access.
