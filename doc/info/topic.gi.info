10/17/84   General Information 

The Multics help system includes a number of info segments (info segs)
that contain general information (gi) about features or use of the
system.  The info names of these segments end with the suffix
"gi.info".  For example, acl_matching.gi.info describes how Access
Control List (acl) entries are matched with User_ids in access control
commands such as set_acl.  The suffix ".info" is assumed if you don't
provide it; so to get the info segment on acl_matching, type,
   help acl_matching.gi

To get a complete list of the info segs whose names have the suffix
"gi.info", use the list_help command:
   list_help gi

If you want a list of info segs that pertain to a particular subject,
type a word, or a string of characters that is part of a word, that
describes that subject and list_help prints a list of all info names
containing that word or partial word.  For example, if you want a list
of info segs that describe the Multics mail facility, type,
   list_help mail

For more information about list_help, including its method for
matching character strings, type,
   help list_help
