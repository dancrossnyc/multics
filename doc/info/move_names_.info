     char(*), bit(1) aligned, fixed bin(35));
call move_names_ (dir_name, entry_name, target_dir, target_name,
     caller, error_sw, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the directory in which the original segment is found.  (Input)
entry_name
   is a name on the original segment.  (Input)

target_name
   is a name already on the target segment.  (Input)
caller

   nd_handler_.  (Input)


error_sw
   indicates which segment the error indicated by "code" occurred on;it
   is set to "0"b if the error was on the original segment and to "1"b
   if on the target.  (Output)
code

deleted, then the code "error_table_$namedup" is returned to the
