07/30/86  Virtual entries (general information)

The cv_entry_ subroutine converts a character string into a Multics
entry value.  Altogether nine forms are accepted.  The command
processor performs a similar transformation to the command name to
derive the command's entry, but only accepts five of the forms.


List of virtual entries:
refname$entrypoint
   The entry at the word identified by the definition named entrypoint
   in the object file found using search rules to find refname.  The
   refname follows the rules for entrynames, but entrypoint can be up
   to 254 characters in length.
refname
   The same as refname$refname.
refname$offset
   The entry at the word identified by octal offset in the object file
   found using search rules to find refname.  The command processor
   doesn't distinguish this case from refname$entrypoint.
refname$
   same as ref_name$0.  The command processor also uses a zero offset.


path$entrypoint
   The entry at the word identified by the definition named entrypoint
   in the object file identified by path.  In this case, path is
   distinguished from the refname case by containing less-than (<) or
   greater-than (>) characters.
path
   The same as path$entrypoint, except that the word is identified by
   the definition named by the final entryname in the expanded form of
   path.
path|entrypoint
   The same as path$entrypoint, but in this case, the vertical-bar
   causes the interpretatation of the preceding string as a path, so no
   less-than or greater-than is needed as in the dollar sign case.
   Note that the command processor does not recognize the vertical-bar
   as a virtual entry delimiter.


path|offset
   The entry at the word identified by the octal offset in the object
   file identified by path.
path|
   The same as path|0.


Notes: Converting a character string to a entry value will initiate the
object file with the refname or the final entryname of the expanded
path if the file was not previously initiated or the name was not a
refname of the segment.  This can also result in the termination of the
refname if it was previously associated with another segment.
