06/13/90  get_bound_seg_info_

Function:  The get_bound_seg_info_ subroutine is used by several
object display programs concerned with bound segments to obtain
information about a segment as a bound segment as well as general
object information.


Syntax:
dcl get_bound_seg_info_ entry (ptr, fixed bin(24), ptr, ptr, ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call get_bound_seg_info_ (obj_ptr, bit_count, oi_ptr, bm_ptr,
     sblk_ptr, code);


Arguments:
obj_ptr
   is a pointer to the beginning of the segment.  (Input)
bit_count
   is the bit count of the segment.  (Input)
oi_ptr
   is a pointer to the object format structure returned by the
   object_info_$display entry point.  (Input)  This structure is
   defined in object_info.incl.pl1.


bm_ptr
   is a pointer to the bind map.  (Output)
sblk_ptr
   is a pointer to the base of the symbol block containing the
   bindmap.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:  If obj_ptr points to an object segment but no bindmap is
found, two possible codes are returned.  One is
error_table_$not_bound, indicating that the segment is not bound.
The other is error_table_$oldobj, indicating that the segment was
bound before the binder produced internal bind maps.  If either one
of these is returned, the structure pointed to by oi_ptr contains
valid information.
