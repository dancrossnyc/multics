Syntax:  convert_configuration_deck ascii_path binary_path


Function: converts an ascii source form of a configuration deck, as 
produced by print_configuration_deck, into a binary (system) form.


Arguments:
ascii_path
   is the pathname of an ascii source form of a config deck.  Both labeled 
   and unlabeled fields may appear on the config cards.  The 
   archive convention is allowed.
binary_path
   is the pathname of the resultant binary config deck.  The form is 
   compatible with the system config deck.  The equals convention is 
   recognized.


Notes: This command is intended to be used to perform a level of 
validation on a proposed new ascii config deck.  It may also be used 
to convert an ascii config deck into the form required by 
compare_configuration_deck.
