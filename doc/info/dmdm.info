01/10/87  display_mrds_dm,dmdm


Syntax as a command:  dmdm db_path {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays the details of the data base model and
data definition for a given data base.  It can be used to reconstruct
the original create_mrds_db data model source from the data base.


Arguments:
db_path
   is the pathname of the data base for which the data model is to be
   displayed.


Control arguments:
   can be chosen from the following:
-attribute {modifier}, -attr {modifier}
   displays attribute information.  The modifier may be name(s) or
   -unreferenced (-unref).  If name(s) is supplied, information for the
   attribute name(s) is displayed.  If -unreferenced is supplied,
   attribute information about all unreferenced attributes is
   displayed.  If no modifier is supplied, attribute information about
   all attributes is displayed.
-brief, -bf
   displays only relation and attribute names.  No information on the
   characteristics of the attributes and relations is provided.  This
   control argument is incompatible with the -names control argument.


-cmdb
   specifies that the output is to be in the same format as an input
   source text for create_mrds_db.  If the -output_file control
   argument is supplied, then the segment can be used to create another
   data base with the same definitions.  Only the -brief, -long, and
   -output_file control arguments are compatible with this control
   argument.
-crossref {type}, -xref {type} displays an information cross-reference.
   The type may be domain (dom), attribute (attr), or all.  If the type
   is domain, each domain is listed with a list of attributes in which
   the domain is referenced.  If the type is attribute, each attribute
   is listed with a list of relations in which the attribute is
   referenced.  If the type is all, both domain and attribute
   cross-references are displayed.  (Default is "all".)  See the
   examples below which show the information displayed.


-domain {modifier}, -dom {modifier}
   displays domain information.  The modifier may be name(s) or
   -unreferenced (-unref).  If name(s) is supplied, information for the
   domain name(s) is displayed.  If -unreferenced is supplied, domain
   information about all unreferenced domains is displayed.  If no
   modifier is supplied, domain information about all domains is
   displayed.
-header, -he
   displays header information for the data base.
-history, -hist
   displays restructuring history information.  If the data base is
   restructured more than once, the history entries are displayed in
   reverse chronological order.


-index names, -ix names
   displays information about indexed relations for each relation name
   supplied.  If no names are supplied, then information about all
   indexed relations is displayed.
-long, -lg
   displays all available information about relations and their
   attributes.  For relations, this includes the number of attributes
   and the layout of the attributes in the tuple.  For attributes, this
   includes the name of the underlying domain and the declaration.
   This control argument is incompatible with the -names control
   argument.
-names, -nm
   displays the format of domains, attributes, relations, and indexed
   relations as a list of the names.  This argument is incompatible
   with -brief or -long control arguments.


-no_header, -nhe
   prevents display of the header information.  (Default)
-no_output_file, -nof
   displays output on the user_output switch.  (Default)
-output_file path, -of path
   places the output in the segment named by path rather than being
   displayed on the user_output switch.  If the segment already exists,
   its contents are overwritten.
-relation names, -rel names
   displays relation information for each relation name supplied.  If
   no names are supplied, the relation information for all relations is
   displayed.


-temp_dir path
   provides for a directory with more quota than the default of the
   process directory when more temporary storage is needed to do a
   display_mrds_dm on a source with many relations and attributes.  For
   example, doing a display_mrds_dm on a 127 relation source may
   require this argument.  If the user gets a record quota overflow in
   the process directory during a display_mrds_dm, then a new_process
   is required.  A retry of the display_mrds_dm with the -temp_dir
   argument, giving a pathname of a directory with more quota than the
   process directory, should then be done.


Notes:  If neither -long nor -brief is specified, the relation name is
displayed for each relation as well as the name and user view
declaration of each attribute.


This command does not work for submodels (see display_mrds_dsm).


For version 4 data bases, the user must be a DBA in order to use this
command on a secured data base.


If -long is specified, the header output indicates the secured state of
the data base.
