12/14/88  display_mailing_address, dsmla

Syntax:  dsmla {name(s)} {-control arguments}


Function:  displays the specified mail table entries with default
mailing address(es), which appear in the format used in message headers
displayed by read_mail.  In addition, if the mail table entry specifies
an ACS segment to allow other maintainers to update it, this pathname
is displayed, and also any alias names associated with the mail table
entry are displayed.


Arguments:
name(s)
   is the personid or alias of the user whose mailing address should
   be displayed, or the name or alias of a mail table entry for a forum
   or mailing list.  The command displays the mailing address for each
   one (printing a warning message for invalid ones).  If none are
   given, the default is the current user.  The star convention is
   allowed and the address information of any name(s) matching the
   starname will be displayed  (See "Notes on starnames").


Control arguments:
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies that mail table name STR literally contains characters
   which are star name characters (eg, *, ?).


Notes on starnames:  As dsmla is insensitive to the type case of the
specified name, the matching of starnames is also performed insensitive
to type case.  If more than one mail table name are equal except for
type case and all match the given starname, then all are displayed.
