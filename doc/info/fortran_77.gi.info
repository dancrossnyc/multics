The FORTRAN 77 language is defined by the American National Standard
X3.9-1978.  This new standard for the FORTRAN language contains
several significant additions to the previous standard (ANSI
X3.9-1966).  Among them are:

- character string expressions, including substrings and concatenation
- an IF-THEN-ELSE construct permitting "structured" FORTRAN programs
- programmer-specified lower bounds for arrays
- direct access input/output
- list directed input/output
- DO loops whose range may be executed zero times

For the most part, the new features of FORTRAN 77 are upward
compatible with the existing Multics FORTRAN language.  Some in fact
already exist in Multics FORTRAN, and others exist but with a
different syntax.  There are several aspects of FORTRAN 77, however,
that are incompatible with the existing Multics FORTRAN language.


FORTRAN 77 on Multics:
FORTRAN 77 is being implemented on Multics by extending the current
Multics FORTRAN compiler.  The ultimate goal of the FORTRAN 77 effort
on Multics is to produce a compiler which accepts standard-conforming
FORTRAN 77 programs, which continues to accept existing Multics
FORTRAN programs with no modification, and which attempts to smooth
the transition from 1966 FORTRAN to FORTRAN 77.


In an effort to meet this goal, two new options have been introduced -
ansi66 and ansi77.  Any particular program unit is compiled with one
of these options in effect.  Program units compiled under the ansi66
option will be interpreted as they have been interpreted by Multics
FORTRAN in the past.  Program units compiled under the ansi77 option
will be interpreted according to the FORTRAN 77 standard wherever it
differs from the existing Multics FORTRAN language.


It is important to note that the ansi66/ansi77 distinction does not
affect all new features of FORTRAN 77; nor does it affect all features
of Multics FORTRAN that are extensions to the 1966 standard.  Instead,
the ansi66/ansi77 distinction serves only to control the
interpretation of constructs that have different, incompatible
meanings (or implementations) in Multics FORTRAN and FORTRAN 77.


As many features from Multics FORTRAN and from FORTRAN 77 as possible
will be available under BOTH the ansi66 and ansi77 options.  The
benefit of this approach is twofold.  First, this will allow existing
programs to use some of the new features in FORTRAN 77 without full
conversion to FORTRAN 77.  Second, this will allow programs to be
easily converted to FORTRAN 77; only the particular constructs that
are incompatible need be changed.


FORTRAN 77 availability:
The full FORTRAN 77 language will be made available in two stages.
The first stage, which has been completed, includes support of a full
character data type, and introduces the ansi66/ansi77 distinction.
The second stage, which is scheduled to be completed in the MR9
timeframe, will include the remaining features of FORTRAN 77.


Caveat - incompatible changes:
Because FORTRAN 77 is being implemented on Multics in two stages,
additional incompatibilities may be introduced under control of the
ansi77 option.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to enumerate all such
incompatibilities at this time.  Users are urged to exercise caution
when compiling programs under the ansi77 option, keeping in mind that
future incompatible changes are possible.
