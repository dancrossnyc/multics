09/10/87  trim_list, tls


Syntax as a command:  tls path -control_args


Function:  deletes selected records from the specified lister file.
Because selection is required for trimming any lists, the select
control argument must be used with this command.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file being trimmed.  The suffix lister
   must be the last component of the lister file name; however, if path
   does not have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-select STR, -sel STR
   specifies the records selected for deletion.  This is a REQUIRED
   argument.
-totals, -tt
   displays the number of records deleted.  This is an OPTIONAL
   argument.


Notes:  The trim_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the trim is not performed, for some reason
other than no records matching the selection expression, or the
invocation of trim_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 1 is set
when the selection expression matches no records.  A severity of 0 is
set when at least one record is trimmed and the command terminates
normally.
