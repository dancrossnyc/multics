02/02/84  chalias

Syntax:  chalias Person_id {alias}


Function: allows the accounting administrator to give a user a login
alias or change his existing alias.  The alias can be a maximum of
eight characters; the first character must be a lowercase letter.
Only one alias per user is allowed.  An alias is particularly useful
for a user with a long or complex name.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose login alias is to be changed.
alias
   is the new login alias of the user.  If this argument is omitted,
   the chalias command prints the user's old alias and waits for the
   accounting administrator to either enter the new one or enter a null
   line (to retain the old alias).
