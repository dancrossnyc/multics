03/19/85  tc_io_


The tc_io_ I/O module supports terminal independent I/O to the screen
of a video terminal.

Entry points in this module are not called directly by users; rather,
the module is accessed through the I/O system interfaces iox_.


Attach Description:
        tc_io_ {device} {-control_args}


Arguments:
device
   is the channel name of the device to be attached If a device is not
   given, the -login_channel control argument must be given.


Control arguments:
-login_channel
   specifies attachment to the user's primary login channel.  If a
   device is not specified, then the user's login channel is used.
   This control argument flags this switch for reconnection by the
   process disconnection facility.  If the user's login device should
   hang up, this switch will be automatically closed, detached,
   attached, and opened on the user's new login channel when the user
   reconnects, if permission to use this facility is specified in the
   SAT and PDT for the user.
-destination DESTINATION
   specifies that the attached device is to be called using the address
   DESTINATION.  In the case of telephone auto_call lines, DESTINATION
   is the telephone number to be dialed.


-no_block
   specifies that the device is to be managed asynchronously.  The tty_
   subroutine will not block to wait for input to be available or
   output space to be available.  This control argument should not be
   used on the login channel, because it will cause the command
   listener to loop calling get_chars.
-no_hangup_on_detach
   prevents the detach entry point from hanging up the device.  This is
   not meaningful for the login channel.
-hangup_on_detach
   causes the detach entry point to hang up the device automatically.
   This is not meaningful for the login channel.


Open Operation:
Opens the module for stream_input_output.


Get Line Operation:
The get_line operation is not supported.


Control Operation:
The following control orders are supported:
clear_screen
   clears the entire terminal screen.  The info_ptr is null.  It is
   intended for use when the screen image may have been damaged due to
   communications problems, for example.
get_capabilities
   returns information about the capabilities of the terminal.  The
   info structure is described in the description of the
   "get_capabilities" control order in the window_io_ module.
get_break_table
   returns the current break table.  The info pointer should point to a
   break table, declared in window_control_info.incl.pl1.


set_break_table
   sets the break table.  The info pointer should point to a break
   table as defined by the get_break_table order, above.  By default,
   the break table has "1"b for all nonprintable characters, and "0"b
   elsewhere.  Applications that set the break table must be careful to
   reset it afterwards, and establish an appropriate cleanup handler.
set_line_speed
   sets the speed of the terminal's connection to Multics.  The
   info_ptr should point to a fixed binary number representing the line
   speed in characters per second.  Negative line speeds are not
   allowed.


set_term_type
   changes the terminal type.  The info pointer should point to a
   set_term_type_info structure.  This sets
   window_status_pending for all windows and sets the ttp_change field
   in the window_status structure along with the screen_invalid.  This
   operation re-initializes all the terminal specific video system
   information such as the video sequences, length and width of the
   screen, and capabilities.  It is equivalent to doing "window_call
   revoke; stty -ttp new_terminal_type; window_call invoke", except no
   windows are destroyed.  The set_term_type_info structure is declared
   in set_term_type_info.incl.pl1.  The send_initial_string, set_modes
   and ignore_line_type flags are all ignored by the video system. The
   initial string will always be sent.


reconnection
   determines the new terminal type (which may or may not be the same
   as before the disconnection).  Performs a set_term_type control
   order to inform the rest of the system of the change in terminal
   type.  If the set_term_type fails then the
   video_utils_$turn_off_login_channel is invoked in an attempt to
   re-attach tty_.  Reconnection (a field in window_status) is set to
   indicate to an application doing get_window_status that a
   reconnection has occurred.

   The window_status_info structure is declared in
   window_status.incl.pl1.
