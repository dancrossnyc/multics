02/15/89 Errata Information for MR 12.2


Page 2-6 change the line:

  The maximum number of characters allowed in a single character string
  is 256.

to read:

  The maximum number of characters allowed in a single character string
  constant is 512. The maximum size of a character variable is 1301071
  (128K-1).

  The  use  of  large  character variables may cause the compiler to
  indicate that it has overflowed the limit of 62000 words of automatic
  storage, or 128K words of static storage. This can be avoided by
  compiling with the -large_array (-la) option.


Page 6-8 under the section entitled "Equivalence Statement".

Change the first line from
    > Syntax
           equivalence (e, e[,e]...) [,(e, e [,e]...)]...
      where each e is a variable or array name.
to
    > Syntax
           equivalence (e, e[,e]...)[,(e, e [,e]...)]...
     where each e is a variable, array, array element or character substring
     name.

Add the following line:

    > Substring indexes are unsigned integer constants and can only take on
      positive values.
after
   > Subscripts are all unsigned integer constants or constant expressions,
     and they may take on negative values.


Add the following line into "Examples of valid equivalence group" section:
    > equivalence (x(1:4), y(2:))
