Syntax:  rf paths {-control_args}


Function: types out text segments in manuscript form.


Arguments: 
paths

   need not be given.


Control arguments: 
-ball N, -bl N
   convert output to a form suitable for an N typeball.
-character, -ch
   create entryname.chars, listing page and line numbers of special characters,
   normally not printable, that must be drawn in by hand.
-device N, -dv N
   prepare output compatible with device N.
-from N, -fm N
   start printing at the page numbered N.
-hyphenate, -hph
   call user-supplied procedure to perform hyphenation.
-indent N, -in N
   set initial indentation to N.
-no_pagination, -npgn
   suppress page breaks.
-number, -nb
   print source segment line numbers in output.
-page N, -pg N
   change the initial page number to N.
-parameter arg, -pm arg
   assign arg as a string to the internal variable "Parameter".
-pass N
   make N passes over the input.
-segment, -sm
   direct output to the segment or multisegment file named entryname.runout,
   where entryname is the name of the input segment.
-stop, -sp
   wait for a carriage return before each page.
-to N
   finish printing after the page numbered N.
-wait, -wt
   wait for a carriage return before the first page.

Built-in symbols:  runoff has over 50 internal variables,
which are available to the user.  In addition, the user can
set his own variables with the .sr control request.  See the
runoff command in the MPM Commands for the list of built-in
symbols.


Expressions:  can be either arithmetic or string and consist
of numbers and operators in appropriate combinations.  The
operators and order of precedence are--
^  (bit-wise negation), -(unary)
*,/,\  (remainder)
+,-  (binary)
=, <, >, /, <, >  (all are comparison operators
                   that yield -1 for true or 0 for false)
&  (bit-wise AND)
|  (bit-wise OR), = (bit-wise equivalence)
Parentheses for grouping.

The values can have the following forms --
String
   <string>=<basicstring> | <concatenation> | <substr>; <basicstring>="xxx"
   <concatenation>=<string><basicstring>; <substr>=<string>(x,y)
   escape sequences - *b,*t,*n,*s,*",**,*cnnn (BS,HT,NL,space,",*,\nnn)
Arithmetic adecimal number; # followed by octal digits - an octal number; @
   followed by hexadecimal digits - a hexadecimal number
