02/22/85  set_resource, setr

Syntax as a command:  setr type STR1...STRN {-control_args}


Function: modifies parameters of a resource.


Arguments:
type
   is a resource type defined in the Resource Type Description Table
   (RTDT).
STRi
   is the unique identifying name of the particular resource being
   modified.  If STR looks like a control argument (with a preceding
   hyphen), then use -name (-nm) before it.


Control arguments:
-access_class accr, -acc accr
   sets the initial AIM access class parameters, where accr is the
   access class range; you must supply -priv with it.  If your
   authorization is within the access class range inclusive, you are
   allowed to read and write to the resource (provided you also meet
   other access requirements).
-acs_path path
   specifies the pathname of the access control segment (ACS) for this
   resource.  The ACS and the desired access control list set are not
   created by set_resource but by the accounting owner.  If you give no
   -acs_path, the accounting owner of the resource is given rew access
   by default.


-alloc STR
   sets the allocation state of the resource to free or allocated,
   where STR must be either "on" or "off"--on sets the allocation state
   to allocated, off to free.  If you don't supply -alloc, the
   allocation state is free.  (The allocation state flag is a
   convenience to you and is largely ignored by resource management.)
-attributes STR, -attr STR
   specifies the desired values for the attributes of this resource.
-charge_type name, -crgtp name
   specifies the name of the billing algorithm used to account for the
   use of this resource.
-comment STR, -com STR
   specifies the desired value of the comment string for this resource.


-location STR, -loc STR
   specifies a descriptive location for the resource, to aid the
   operator in locating the resource when it is stored in a special
   place (e.g., a vault, a different room, etc.); you must supply -priv
   with -location.
-lock STR
   locks or unlocks the resource, where STR must be either "on" or
   "off"--on prevents any use of the resource, off allows its use.  If
   you don't give -lock, the lock is off.  You must supply -priv with
   -lock.


-priv
   makes a privileged call to obtain the status of this resource (see
   "Access required" below).  If you are a privileged user (RCP
   Administrator), it allows you to set and change certain fields
   (including the acs_pathname) for this resource in the registry, thus
   effectively allowing yourself enough access to mount a tape for a
   write.
-release_lock STR, -rll STR
   specifies whether the resource can be released by the owner or only
   by a privileged process (see "Access required" below)--on resources
   can only be released by a privileged process, off resources by the
   owner.  If you don't supply -release_lock, the resource can be
   released by the owner.  You must give -priv with -release_lock.


Access required: You need write effective access to the resource named
to modify its status; execute effective access to the resource named to
modify protected attributes (only the accounting owner can modify the
ACS path); and execute access to the rcp_admin_ gate to use
-access_class, -lock, -location, -priv, and -release_lock.


Notes: If you specify multiple resources and an error occurs in the
modification of one of them, none are modified.
