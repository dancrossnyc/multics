Entry points in active_fnc_err_:

:Entry: active_fnc_err_: 01/12/82 active_fnc_err_


Function: is called by active functions when they detect unusual
status conditions.  It formats an error message and then signals
the condition active_function_error.  The default handler for this
condition prints the error message and then returns the user to
command level.  (See "List of System Conditions and Default Handlers"
in Section 6 of the MPM Reference Guide for further information.)

Since this subroutine can be called with a varying number of arguments,
it is not permissible to include a parameter attribute list in its
declaration.


Syntax:
declare active_fnc_err_ entry options (variable);
call active_fnc_err_ (code, caller, control_string, arg1, ..., argN);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code (fixed bin(35)).  (Input)
caller
   is the name (char(*)) of the calling procedure.  (Input) It can be
   either varying or nonvarying.
control_string
   is an ioa_ subroutine control string (char(*)).  (Input) (The ioa_
   subroutine is described in the MPM Subroutines.)  This argument is
   optional.  See "Notes" below.
argI
   are ioa_ subroutine arguments to be substituted into control_string.
   (Input) These arguments are optional.  (However, they can only be
   used if the control_string argument is given first.)  See "Notes"
   below.


Notes:  The error message prepared by the active_fnc_err_ subroutine
has the format:
   caller:  system_message user_message
where:
   caller
      is the caller argument described above and should be the name 
      of the procedure detecting the error.
   system_message
      is a standard message from a standard status table corresponding
      to the value of code.  If code is equal to 0, no system_message 
      is returned.
   user_message
      is constructed by the ioa_ subroutine from the control_string 
      and argI arguments described above.  If the control_string and 
      argI arguments are not given, user_message is omitted.


:Entry: suppress_name:  01/12/82  active_fnc_err_$suppress_name


Function:	 This entrypoint is functionally the same as active_fnc_err_,
but it suppresses the caller name and the colon at the beginning of the
error message.  The caller name is nevertheless passed to the
active_function error handler.


Syntax:
declare active_fnc_err_$suppress_name entry options (variable);
call active_fnc_err_$suppress_name (code, caller, control string,
     arg1,...argN);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code (fixed bin(35)).  (Input)
caller
   is the name (char(*)) of the calling procedure.  (Input) It can be
   either varying or nonvarying.
control_string
   is an ioa_ subroutine control string (char(*)).  (Input)  This
   argument is optional.
argI
   are ioa_ subroutine arguments to be substituted into control_string.
   (Input) These arguments are optional.  (However, they can only be
   used if the control_string argument is given first.)
