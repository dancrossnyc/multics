08/02/84  quiesce_mrds_db, qmdb

Syntax as a command:  qmdb database_path {-control_args}


Function:  This DBA tool quiesces a given data base, or frees it from
being quiesced, for such purposes as data base backup or other
exclusive activities that require a consistent and non-active data
base.


Arguments:
database_path
   is the pathname of the data base to be quiesced or freed.


Control arguments:
-free
   causes the data base to be freed from a quiesced state.
-quiet
   causes the data base to be quiesced.  (Default)
-wait_time N, -wt N
   sets the amount of time that an attempt to quiesce waits for
   conflicting data base users to depart before failing (see "Notes").


Notes:  Time (N) for -wait_time is in seconds.  A long wait time is
needed if a display_mrds_db_status shows many users; otherwise, a short
wait time will suffice.  The default wait time is zero seconds.

The control args -quiet and -free are mutually exclusive, as are -free
and -wait_time.

Only the quiescing process may open a quiesced data base.  Only a DBA
can use this command.
