07/12/83  print_sample_refs

Syntax:  print_sample_refs name {-control_arg}


Function:  interprets the three data segments produced by the
sample_refs command, and produces a printable output segment that
contains the following information:  a detailed trace of segment
references, a segment number to pathname dictionary, and histograms of
the Procedure Segment Register (PSR) and Temporary Segment Register
(TSR) segment reference distributions.  (See the description of the
sample_refs command.)


Arguments:
name
   specifies the names of the data segments to be interpreted, as well
   as the name of the output segment to be produced.  This argument can
   be either an absolute or relative pathname.  If name does not end
   with the suffix srf, it is assumed.

   The appropriate directory is searched for three segments with
   entrynames as follows:
      (entry portion of) name.srf1
      (entry portion of) name.srf2
      (entry portion of) name.srf3

   The output segment is placed in the user's working directory with
   the entryname:
      (entry portion of) name.list


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the detailed trace of segment references is not to be
   generated.


Notes:  The print_sample_refs command is able to detect a reused
segment number.  The appearance of a parenthesized integer preceding a
segment number indicates reusage.
