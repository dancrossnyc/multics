01/14/87  set_max_length, sml

Syntax as a command:  sml path length {-control_args}


Function:  allows the maximum length of a nondirectory segment to be
set.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the segment whose maximum length is to be set.
   If path is a link, the maximum length of the target segment of the
   link is set.  You can use the star convention.
length
   is the new maximum length expressed in words.  If this length is not
   a multiple of 1024 words, it is converted to the next higher
   multiple of 1024 words.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message that the length argument has been
   converted to the next multiple of 1024 words.
-decimal, -dc
   specifies that length is a decimal number.  (Default)
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.
-octal, -oc
   specifies that length is an octal number.


Access required:  You need m permission on the directory containing the
segment.


Notes:  The maximum length is the maximum size the segment can attain.
Currently maximum length must be a multiple of 1024 words (one page).

If the new maximum length is less than the current length, you are
asked if the segment should be truncated to the maximum length.  If you
answer "yes," the truncation takes place and the maximum length of the
segment is set; if "no," no action is taken.

You can't set the maximum length of a mailbox or message segment unless
the segment is empty.
