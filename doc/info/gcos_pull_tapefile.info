08/02/84  gcos_pull_tapefile, gcpt

Syntax as a command:  gcpt {reel_number} {-control_args}


Function:  This command copies files from a GCOS tape into the Multics
storage system.  Since it was designed to read files from a total
system tape, from which the gcos simulator libraries are built, it
accepts records longer than 320 words.  It reads the header label
preceding each file, prints the name and file sequence number, and asks
the user if the file is to be copied.  If the answer is yes, it asks
for a pathname, and copies the file into it.  Then it continues with
the next file.  This process is terminated either by a reply of "quit"
to the copy question, or an end-of-reel label or partial label on the
tape.


Arguments:
reel_number
   is the number of the tape reel to be read.  It need not match any
   field in the tape labels.  (See -attached control argument.)


Control arguments:  can be selected from the following, and can be in
   any order:
      NOTE:  The following list identifies all control arguments
      grouped by function.
      ATTACHING TAPE
         -attached
         -block
         -density
         -detach
         -gsr
         -retain


      PROGRAM CONTROL
         -brief
         -long
         -long_brief
         -skip
   -attached, -att
      may be given in place of reel_number to indicate that the tape
      has been retained from a previous use of this command and is
      already mounted.  (See -retain control argument)
   -block N
      N specifies the tape buffer size (any value up to 4096) needed to
      read a GCOS total system tape.  This argument is not required in
      order to read a total system tape, but is needed for tapes with
      records larger than 3842 words.  (Default is 3842)


   -brief, -bf
      specifies that certain warning and informative messages NOT be
      displayed.
   -density N, -den N
      N specifies tape density.  (Default is 1600)
   -detach, -det
      specifies detaching and dismounting of the tape before any
      attempt is made to attach the currently specified tape.  If this
      is the only argument given, the tape is detached and no other
      processing takes place.


   -gsr
      specifies standard size records (320 words or less) to be copied
      into the Multics storage system in a format readable by other
      Multics tools that manipulate GCOS files.  Records shorter than
      320 words are padded out to 320 words, allowing a read of 320
      words to obtain exactly one record.  This argument should not be
      used when reading a total system tape.
   -long, -lg
      specifies that hardware status, labels, and length and first word
      of all data records be displayed.
   -long_brief, -lb
      specifies that hardware status and labels be displayed, but
      length and first word of data records NOT be displayed.


   -retain, -ret
      specifies that the tape remain mounted when processing by this
      command is completed.  This saves work for the Multics operator
      if several attempts to read the tape are to be made.
   -skip N
      N specifies the files to be skipped over before the user is asked
      if files are to be copied.  (Questioning starts with N+1st file.)
