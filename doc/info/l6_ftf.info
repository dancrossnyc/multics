08/22/83  l6_ftf

Syntax:  l6_ftf channel_name {-control_args}


Function:  allows a process to handle file transfer requests from a
Level 6 using the L6 File Transfer Facility (FTF) protocol (referred to
as L6 TRAN, see the DPS 6 & Level 6 to Level 66 File Transmission
Facility User's Guide, Order No. CZ60).  This command continues
to listen for and carry out Level 6 requests until the user explicitly
tells it to stop.  Only sequential ASCII or sequential binary files can
be transferred to or from the Level 6.  ASCII files on Multics are
assumed to be stream files when sending and are stored as stream files
when receiving.  Binary files on Multics have a special format (see
"Notes" below).


Arguments:
channel_name
   is the name of a polled VIP subchannel over which the file transfers
   take place.  It must have the "x" prefix (i.e., b.h217.x01).


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   prints a line describing each file transfer as it starts and as it
   completes.  The default is not to print this information.
   -target_dir (-td) restricts the pathnames of any files to be
   transferred to be relative to the target directory.  The root may be
   specified as ">"; this allows absolute pathnames to be specified.
   The default is the working directory.


Access Required:  The user must have rw access to the Access Control
Segment (ACS) of the specified channel name to use the file transfer
facility.  The user must have the "dialok" attribute turned on in the
Project Master File (PMF).  The polled VIP subchannel must have the
slave attribute in the Channel Master File (CMF).


Notes:  This command continues to listen for and process file transfer
requests from the Level 6 on the specified channel until the user types
"quit" ("q") or the channel disconnects.  The quit request can be typed
at any time but only takes effect before any file transfer has started
or between two file transfers.

Interrupting and releasing a file transfer in the middle of the
transfer may result in aborting the operation in an inconsistent state,
and causing the Level 6 task to hang.

The Polled VIP subchannel must be defined with a terminal type that
assigns "max_message_len" to a value of 1009 in its additional_info
statement.


Only sequential ASCII or sequential binary files can be transferred
from or created on the Level 6.  On Multics, ASCII files are assumed to
be or are created as stream vfiles.  Notice that blank lines in a Level
6 file actually have some character on them, usually a space or tab.
These characters end up in the Multics file.  The command takes care of
sending blank lines from Multics files to the Level 6 by sending a line
containing a single-space character.

On Multics, binary files are sequential vfiles.  Each record is assumed
to have the following format:

      dcl 1 binary_record aligned based,
            2 num_sextets fixed bin(35) aligned,
            2 sextets (0 refer binary_record.num_sextets) fixed bin(6)
              unsigned unaligned;

Each binary record is stored in a vfile_ record of size
currentsize(binary_record) * 4.
