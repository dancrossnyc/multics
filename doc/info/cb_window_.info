03/19/85  cb_window_


This is the basic video interface subroutine to be used by COBOL to
create/destroy/change windows.  (If usage-mode = 0 (see cb_menu_$init2)
this subroutine should not be called.)


Entry points in cb_window_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  change:  03/19/85 cb_window_$change


Function:  This entry points provides a facility for changing the size
of an existing window.  The size of a window can always be "shrunk",
however it can be increased only it does not overlap with another
defined window.  (If usage-mode = 0 (see cb_menu_$init2) this entry
point should not be called.)

     77  ret-code    USAGE IS COMP-6.
     call "cb_window_$change" USING window-id, first-line, height,
          ret-code.


Arguments:

     77  ret-code       USAGE IS COMP-6.
     call "cb_window_$clear_window" USING  window-id, ret-code.


Arguments:
window-id
   the window identifier (returned by cb_window_$create) of the window
   to be cleared.  (Input)

:Entry:  create:  03/19/85 cb_window_$create


Function:  This entry is used to create a new window on the terminal
screen.  (If usage-mode = 0 (see cb_menu_$init2) this entry point
should not be called.)


Syntax:
   declarations:
     77  switch-name    PIC X(32).
     77  first-line     USAGE IS COMP-6.
     77  height         USAGE IS COMP-6.
     77  window-id      USAGE IS COMP-6.
     77  ret-code       USAGE IS COMP-6.
     call "cb_window_$create" USING first-line, height, switch-name,
          window-id, ret-code.


Arguments:
first-line
   is the line number where the window is to start.  (Input)
height
   the number of lines used by the window, i.e., its height.  (Input)
switch-name
   the  name  that  the caller  wishes  to associate  with  the switch.
   (Input)
window-id
   the returned id of the window just created.  (Output) It must not be

ret-code
   return code.  (Output)


:Entry:  destroy:  03/19/85 cb_window_$destroy


Function:  Used to destroy a previously created window.  (If usage-mode
= 0 (see cb_menu_$init2) this entry point should not be called.)


Syntax
   declarations:
     77  window-id   USAGE IS COMP-6.
     77  ret-code    USAGE IS COMP-6.
     call "cb_window_$destroy"  USING  window-id, ret-code.


Arguments:
window-id
   window    identifier    (returned    by    the   cb_window_$create).
   (Input/Output) It is reset to an illegal value by this call.
