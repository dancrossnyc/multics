Syntax for attach description:
     cross_ring_ switch_name N


Function: The cross_ring_ I/O module allows an outer ring to attach a
switch to a preexisting switch in an inner ring, and to perform I/O
operations by forwarding I/O from the attachment in the outer ring
through a gate to an inner ring.  The cross_ring_ I/O module is not
called directly by users; rather the module is accessed through the
I/O system.


Arguments:
switch_name
   is a previously registered switch name in ring N.
N
   is a ring number from 0 to 7.


Opening operation:
The inner ring switch may be open or not.  If not open, it will be
opened on an open call.  All modes are supported.


Close operation:
The inner switch is closed only if it was opened by cross_ring_.


Other operations:
All operations are passed on to the inner ring I/O switch.


Notes:  This I/O module allows a program in an outer ring, if permitted
by the inner ring, to use I/O services that are available only from an
inner ring via cross_ring_io_$allow_cross.  By the use of the
cross_ring_io_$allow_cross subroutine a subsystem writer is able to
introduce into an outer ring environment many features from an inner
ring, thereby tailoring it to fit the user's specific needs.

The switch in the inner ring must be attached by the inner ring before
cross_ring_ can be attached in the outer ring.
