Description

0029  none
mseg_mbx_ms_gate_target_ has mseg_check_access_ check for proper ACL
entries to send a wakeup (based upon target mailbox ACL modes) and
audit the result of this check.  Then mseg_mbx_ms_gate_target_
completes wakeup checking by examining AIM restrictions on sending a
wakeup to the target process (one which is accepting wakeups on the
target mailbox).  This AIM check is not audited--thus auditing of
sending wakeups is based only upon ACLs and not ACLs+AIM, so the audit
message produced is sometimes incorrect (success rather than failure).

0018  
The program mseg_mbx_ms_gate_target_ can return random ring 1 stack
garbage to the user ring if a *_own_* call returns
error_table_$no_message.

0016  
There's a bug in mailbox_$wakeup_add_index and
mailbox_$wakeup_aim_add_index which will cause these programs to fail
to return the ID of the message added if, at the same time, they will
also return an error indication (e.g., messags deferred).  This bug
will cause the functional tests to fail as one of the test cases for
MAC must check that a message is added and error_table_$no_info is
returned at the same time.

0014  
The message segment primitives try to audit object that they can't see
the existence of.

When a user passes a pathname including an AIM upgraded directory, or
the pathname of a mailbox whose ACL is corrupted so as to deny access
to the user in ring 1, the message segment primitives get
error_table_$incorrect_access back when they try to list access
information for the segment.

They then turn around and feed the same pathname back in to the
auditing entrypoints of admin_gate_.  These try to use dc_find to find
the actual object, but fail (due to the same lack of access) entering
nasty messages into the syserr log.

There are two approaches to this.  One would be to use privileged paths
in ring 0 for auditing, so that a ring 1 program could audit an
operation with respect to a completely inaccessible object.

This is hard, and probably wrong.

The second is to for ring 1 to notice the error code that means that
the user cannot, and has not, even discovered if the object exists.  In
this case, it can audit the character pathname without any information.

Also, note that ring zero has already audited the access failure.  The
admin_gate_ entry that suppresses audit only suppresses GRANT audits.
