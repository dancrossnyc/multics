12/28/82  mvt_

The mvt_ subroutine provides for extremely efficient translation of
character strings using translations which are not known at compile
time.


Entry points in mvt_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry: mvt_: 12/06/82  mvt_ (entry)


Syntax:
declare mvt_ entry (ptr, ptr, fixed bin(21), char(512) aligned);
call mvt_ (input_string_ptr, output_string_ptr, string_lth,
     translate_table);


Arguments:
input_string_ptr
   is a pointer to the unaligned string to be translated.  (Input)
output_string_ptr
   is a pointer to the string where the results of the translation will
   be placed.  (Input)
string_lth
   is the length of both the input string and the output string in
   characters.  (Input)
translate_table
   is the translation table which defines the actual translation.  See
   mvt_$make_translation_table for a description of how to create this
   table.  (Input)


:Entry:  make_translation_table:  12/06/82 mvt_$make_translation_table


Function:  This entry point creates the translation table used by the
mvt_ subroutine given the second and third arguments which would be
supplied to the PL/I translate builtin function.


Syntax:
declare mvt_$make_translation_table entry (char(*), char(*), char(512)
     aligned);
call mvt_$make_translation_table (translated_list, untranslated_list,
     translate_table);


Arguments:
translated_list
   is the second argument to the PL/I translate builtin and specifies
   the result of translating any occurrence of the corresponding
   characters in untranslated_list present in the input string of the
   mvt_ entry described above.  (Input)
untranslated_list
   is the third argument to the PL/I translate builtin and specifies
   the list of characters which will be translated if found in the
   input string.  (Input)
translate_table
   is set to the translate table which defines the desired translation.
   (Output)


Notes:  The table constructed by this subroutine will cause any
occurence of the N'th character in untranslated_list present in the
input string of mvt_ to be converted into the N'th character in
translated_list.  See the description of the PL/I translate builtin for
more information.

If the PL/I builtin would have been used with only two arguments, use
the value of the collate9 builtin for the untranslated_list argument.
