10/17/84  reverse_before, rvbe

Syntax as a command:  rvbe STRA STRB


Syntax as an active function:  [rvbe STRA STRB]


Function:  performs the same function as the before command/active
function, but in reverse order.


Notes:  The active function returns that part of STRA preceding the
last occurrence of STRB in STRA (before uses the first occurrence).  If
STRB occurs first and nowhere else in STRA, a null string is returned.
If STRB does not occur in STRA, STRA is returned.
   [reverse_before STRA STRB]
is the same as--
   [reverse [after [reverse STRA] [reverse STRB]]]
when STRB appears in STRA.  It is the same as STRA when STRB does not
appear in STRA.
