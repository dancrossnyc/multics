01/30/87 compose_index, comp_index, cndx


Syntax as a command:  comp_index, cndx path {-control_args}


Function:  processes raw index data gathered by compose and produces a
cross-reference index file according to a specified format.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the compin file producing the raw index data.
   The compin suffix need not be given.


Control arguments:
-alpha_header, -ahdr
   inserts centered uppercase alphabetic characters as group separators
   whenever the first character of the primary key changes.
-control_file ctl_path, -cf ctl_path
   uses ctl_path.cndxctl as the control file for this index.  The
   suffix "cndxctl" is assumed if not given.  (The default control file
   is path.cndxctl.)
-number n, -nb n
   one of the 10 (0 through 9) possible raw index data files.  (The
   default value is 0.)  See Notes below.


Notes:  The raw index data files are produced by compose when the .hit
control is used.  (The default raw data file is path.0.cndx.)  The
output file is path_entryname.n.index in the current working directory.
If the output file does not exist, it is created; if it does, it is
overwritten.


The data in the raw data file is processed into an arbitrarily chosen
format, the style of which is determined partially by constants built
into the program and partially by statements in path.cndxctl.


The final set of hit strings (after all raw data processing is
complete) is sorted into an alphabetic collating sequence (i.e.,
without regard to case).  The handling of certain prefix characters is
provided by the use of a control directive.


Index control files
   The index control file contains compose controls and text lines that
   partially determine the format of the index, and directives for
   compose_index that control the processing of the hit strings (see
   "compose_index Control Directives") and complete the definition of
   the index format.  The use of an index control file is not required.
   If one does not exist, defaults in the documentation macros and the
   program determine the format of the index.


   The output file created by this program is to be treated just like
   any other section of the document to which it applies.  Therefore,
   the same macro package initialization must be performed and this is
   done with compose controls at the beginning of the index control
   file.  A standard macro, l0index, is provided for users who do not
   wish to provide their own detailed index format.  The format
   established by this macro is the one used by all Multics user
   documentation.


   All hit string processing control directives are given as compose
   comment strings.  During processing of the index control file, any
   line that is not recognized as a control directive is written to the
   output file for further processing by compose.

compose_index control directives
   For the control directives that follow, all input is given in
   lowercase without regard to the case of the output.


.*blind abcd...
   In many instances, a particular keyword will appear as such and with
   one or more prefix characters.  A typical example is "rawo" and
   "^rawo" in tty_ modes.  It is desirable to have such prefixed and
   unprefixed keys sort together in the index.  To accomplished this,
   the sort algorithm may be made "blind" to such prefix characters by
   the use of this directive.  The set of characters abcd...  are
   treated specially as prefix characters such that keywords with them
   sort after their unprefixed counterparts.  For example:

      .*blind ^\$

      NOTE:  An older form of this directive, ".*ignore" is also
      supported.

   The following directives apply to permuted keys only.


.*phrase str
   Very frequently, it is necessary that a short phrase instead of a
   single word be a key in the index.  This directive provides the
   ability to indicate that such phrases are to be treated as keys.
   Since punctutation may be wanted in the phrase, only one str may be
   given in the line.  For example:

      .*phrase access control
      .*phrase pack labels
      .*phrase control cards


.*tran str1,str2
   Also very frequently, various grammatical forms of a root keyword or
   a suffixed keyword appear in an index and should be sorted together.
   This directive provides the ability to transform such keys for
   sorting only; the given keys will appear in the final index.  For
   example:

      .*tran labels,label
      .*tran labeled,label
      .*tran labelling,label
      .*tran sys_info_$,sys_info_


.*excl excl_key{,excl_key}...
   During permutation, many unwanted hit strings may be generated,
   primarily due to conjunctions, articles, prepositions, etc., in the
   given primary key.  Further, permutation may generate unwanted hit
   strings that have a primary key that is wanted for other hits.  This
   directive controls the exclusion of hit strings that begin with the
   partial hit string excl_key.  Only as much of the unwanted hit
   string as is needed for unique identification need be given, but it
   must contain the entire new primary key.  For example:

      .*excl to,for,from,and,but
      .*excl system~info,reporting~standard
