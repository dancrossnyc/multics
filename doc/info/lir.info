Syntax:  lir {request_identifiers} {-control_args}


Function: lists requests in the Inter-Multics File Transfer queues.


Arguments:
request_identifiers
   determine which requests in the selected queues (-queue/-all/-ds/-sc)
   belonging to the specified users (-admin/-own/-user) are listed.  If
   not given, all of the appropriate requests are listed.  See "Notes
   on request identifiers" below.


List of request_identifiers:
path
   lists all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source pathnames match the relative pathname path.  The star
   convention is allowed.
-entry STR, -et STR
   lists all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   source entry names match STR; the directory portions of the source
   pathnames are ignored.  The star convention is allowed.
-id STR
   lists all requests from the appropriate queues and users whose
   request IDs match the STR.  Type "help request_ids.gi" for a
   description of the syntax of STR.


Control arguments:
-destination STR, -ds STR
   lists requests that are queued for transfer to the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.
-source STR, -sc STR
   lists requests that are queued for transfer from the remote system
   identified by STR.  STR must be one of the names listed by the
   print_imft_sites command.  If neither -destination nor -source is
   specified, the default is -destination imft.
-queue N, -q N
   lists requests entered in priority queue N for the above destination
   or source where N is an integer between 1 and 4 inclusive.  (Default
   -- depends on the destination or source specified)
-all, -a
   lists requests entered in all priority queues for the above
   destination or source.


-brief, -bf
   displays minimal information for each request including its request
   ID, source pathname, and current state.  (Default)
-long, -lg
   displays all information available for each request.
-total, -tt
   displays only the total number of matching requests in each queue.
-position, -psn
   includes the position within the queue of each request.
-no_position, -npsn
   does not include the position within the queue.  (Default)


-long_id, -lgid
   displays the complete request ID for each request.  (Default if
   -long is used)
-short_id, -shid
   displays the short form of the request ID for each request.
   (Default if -long is not used)
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   displayes the absolute pathname of the file or subtree associated
   with each request.  (Default if -long is used)
-entryname, -etnm
   displays only the entry name of the file or subtree.  (Default if
   -long is not used)


-admin, -am
   lists the matching requests submitted by any user.
-own
   lists a matching request only if it was submitted by the user of
   this command.  (Default)
-user STR
   lists a matching request only if it was submitted by the user
   identified by STR.


List of user specifications:
   the STR given to the -user control argument must have one of the
   following forms:
Person.Project
   lists only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on the specified project.
Person.*, Person
   lists only those matching requests entered by the specified user
   while logged in on any project.
*.Project, .Project
   lists only those matching requests entered by any user logged in on
   the specified project.
*.*, *
   lists all matching requests regardless of who entered them.


Access required: If -position, -admin, or -user is specified, at least
"r" extended access is required to the queues; otherwise, at least "o"
extended access is required.


Notes on request identifiers: If path or -entry STR request identifiers
are given, only one -id STR request identifier may be given in which
case only those requests which match one of the path or -entry STR
identifiers and which match the -id STR identifier are listed.


Notes:
If conflicting control arguments (eg: -position and -no_position, or
-destination and -source) are given on the command line, the rightmost
control argument takes effect.
