Syntax:  credit


Function: allows the accounting administrator to enter miscellaneous
credits into the miscfile for billing purposes.  For each transaction,
the Project_id, the amount, and an explanation are required.  All
three input items for a transaction can be put on the same line or
they can be supplied one at a time.  To exit from this command, type
"x" instead of a Project_id.  The miscfile segment is printed using
the pmisc command.  Charges and deletions are made to the miscfile
using the charge and dmisc commands, respectively.
