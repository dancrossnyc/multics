Description

63  phx20774
help doesn't find the right help file when a link is used.

31  phx08130
help does not print the last character of an info seg in old format (one
with \006 paragraph separator characters).  Perhaps the whole \006
support should be removed at this point to resolve this problem.

6  phx03813
help should use com_err_$suppress_name instead of ioa_ for error
messages like "No matching paragraph found." so that the on command
could be used to detect such errors.
