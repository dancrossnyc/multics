08/05/87 disconnect

Syntax:  disconnect


Function: Disconnects the terminal from the current process, suspending
that process if the user's disconnect_ok process attribute is on.
If the trusted path login installation parm is off the terminal will
remain dialed to the system.  If the disconnect_ok process attribute is
on and the trusted path login installation parm is on then a message
will be displayed stating the line must be hung up followed by a
hangup.  If the disconnect_ok process attribute is off then an message
will be displayed stating the process cannot be suspended and no
further action will take place.


Notes: If disconnect is called from an absentee or daemon process an
error message will be returned without further action.


When the process is suspended after disconnection, it will remain that
way for a period of time equal to or less than the site-specified
inactivity time.  Contact your project administrator for process
attribute information.
