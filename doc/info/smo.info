Syntax:  set_mrds_options -control_args 


Function: 
Allows the setting, resetting and displaying the state of various
options relating to MRDS selection expressions.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   Specifies that options existing in a MRDS selection expression are
   to be overridden by those specified by the set_mrds_option command.
   The default is to not override options specified in a selection
   expression.
-optimize off | on, -ot off | on
   Controls the optimization of a MRDS selection expression
   via the MRDS optimizer. The default is to optimize the selection
   expression.


-print_search_order off | on, -pso off | on
   Controls the printing of the search order when a MRDS selection
   expression is evaluated. The default is to not print the search
   order.
-print_selection_expression off | on, -pse off | on
   Causes all selection expressions that are not "-another",
   "-compiled", or "-current" to be displayed when they are
   translated. The default is to not print the selection expression.


-error_report off | on, -er off | on
   Controls how selection expression errors are reported to the user.
   This is done either by just returning a code, (-er off), or
   by a long diagnostic message (-er on). This control argument
   does not affect error reporting that is done via sub_err_
   signalling.
-list, -ls
   Displays the state of all of the switches.
-reset, -rs
   Resets the option values to their defaults. See the section on
   Default values.


Default values:
The default values that MRDS uses if set_mrds_options is never 
invoked, or it is invoked with the -reset control argument are:

-print_search_order       OFF
-optimize                 ON
-print_select_expression  OFF
-error_report             ON
-force                    OFF


Notes:
The command "smo -pso on" will cause all MRDS selection expressions
evaluated in a process to be done as if the keyword "-pso" was
actually in each selection expression. This behaviour will continue
until the command "smo -pso off" is executed or a new process is
initiated, either via new_proc or a logout;login sequence. 

The command "smo -ot off" will cause all MRDS selection expressions
evaluated in a process to be done as if the keyword "-no_ot" was
actually in each selection expression.  This behaviour will continue
until the command "smo -ot on" is executed or a new process is
initiated, either via new_proc or a logout;login sequence.


If the -force argument is not provided the options specified are used
only as default values. That is, they do not affect selection
expressions that have defined the options in the selection expression.

The -reset and -list arguments are incompatible with any other control
arguments.
