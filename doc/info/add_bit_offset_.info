:Entry: add_bit_offset_: 06/15/81  add_bit_offset_

Function: returns a pointer to a bit relative to the bit referenced by
the input pointer.  The displacement to the desired bit may be
positive, negative, or zero.


Syntax:
dcl add_bit_offset_ entry (ptr, fixed bin (24)) returns (ptr)
     reducible;
new_pointer_value = add_bit_offset_ (pointer_value, bit_displacement);


Arguments:
pointer_value
   is the original pointer to which the bit displacement is applied.
   (Input)
bit_displacement
   is the displacement in bits to be applied to the above pointer.
   (Input)
new_pointer_value
   is the result of this operation.  (Output)


Notes: If the result of applying the displacement would cause the
pointer to reference outside the legal boundaries of a segment (either
a negative offset or an offset beyond 256K words), the result of the
call is not defined.
