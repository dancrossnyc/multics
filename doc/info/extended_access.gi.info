03/01/88  Extended Access

Message segments make use of an additional field of access modes, listed
below.

    a (add) process can add a message.
    d (delete) process can delete a message.
    r (read) process can read any message.  If this mode is given,
       s access must also be given.
    o (own) process can read or delete its own messages.
    s (status) process can find out how many messages are in the
       segment.
    w (wakeup) process can send a normal priority wakeup.  If this mode
       is given, a access must also be given.
    n (null) process cannot access the segment in any way.
    u (urgent) process can send "urgent" messages to the user
       accepting messages on the mailbox.  If this mode is given,
       a access must also be given.  (Urgent messages are not
       currently implemented.)


Default extended access for a mailbox:

    adrosw	User.*
    aow		*.SysDaemon.*
