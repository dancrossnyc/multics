12/27/84  Multics help system

Multics provides online help through information segments (info segs)
such as this one.  Type the command "help" with the name of a topic
and the system will print the information contained in the info seg
that describes that topic.  A topic can be an individual command or
some other feature of the system.  For example, to get information
about the print command, type
   help print



Most info segs stop after printing a certain number of lines and ask
you if you want more information.  In response you can type
   yes (or y)   to print the next section of the info seg
   no (or n)    to stop printing the current info seg
   rest (or r)  to print the rest of the info seg without the questions
   top (or t)   to return to the beginning of the info seg.
After typing your request, press CARRIAGE RETURN.

If the help command can't find an info seg for a given info name, use
the list_help command to find info segs that contain the specified
info name in their entrynames.


Notes on short names: Many of the info segs have short names as well
as the long names we've been using thus far.  You get the same
information with the short name; it's just that you have to type fewer
characters on your keyboard.  Three of the four info segs listed above
have short names.  To get the topics info seg, you could type
   help topic

   help module
