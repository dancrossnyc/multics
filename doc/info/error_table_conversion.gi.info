01/24/84  Error table conversion

The official source language for error tables is changing from
error_table_compiler language to alm, with special macros.  The
error_table_compiler will be removed from the system eventually.  Two
macros, defined in et_macros.incl.alm, are used for constructing error
tables:
     et        name_of_error_table
     ec        code_name,{short_message},(long message)

et initializes the error table.


The official source language for error tables is changing from
error_table_compiler.

If there is more than one code_name, they must be separated by commas
and the list enclosed in parentheses.

short_message must be 8 characters or less.  If it is omitted, it will
be set to code_name.

Now that the source is in alm, the alm rules for blanks apply.  In
particular, blanks are treated as field delimiters.


To convert existing error tables to the new format, type--

          ec >t>convert_table name_of_error_table

This creates an alm source segment.
