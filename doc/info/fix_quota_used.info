03/06/84  fix_quota_used

Syntax:  fix_quota_used path


Function: repairs inconsistencies in storage system quota used for a
directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname if the directory for which quota is to be made
   consistent.


Access required: Access to the hphcs_ gate is required.


Notes: The normal use of this command is from the fix_quota_used.ec
exec_com, or by the "x repair" operator command.  When a quota
(segment quota or directory quota) is found inconsistent and
corrected, a message is printed.  If the correction causes a directory
to have greater quota used than allocated, another message is printed.
