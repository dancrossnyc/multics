08/02/84  gcos_library_summary, gcls

Syntax as a command:  gcls path {-control_args}


Function:  This command prints a summary of the contents of a GCOS
tape-format system-loadable file or a simulator-format software
library.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of either a GCOS format system-loadable file or a
   simulator-format software library file.


Control arguments:
brief, -bf
   prints only the names of the modules, omitting any preface or
   catalog information.
-gcos, -gc
   identifies the input file as a GCOS ** file.
-preface
   prints the preface record information found at the beginning of each
   module.


Notes:  If path is a GCOS format file as copied from a Total System
Tape, then gcls lists the modules and the preface information.

If path is a GCOS simulator-format library, then gcls lists the module
names and the catalog offset.

If path is a native GCOS ** file and -gcos is specified, then the
modules on the file are listed.
