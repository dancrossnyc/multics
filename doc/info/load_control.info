03/25/74  Load Control Groups

Load control groups control who gets logged in.
Each project is assigned to a load control group, which has
a quota of guaranteed primary load units.
When a user logs in, he is assigned "primary" status
if his load control group is not full. He gets a message
of the form
     You are protected from preemption until 1832.
which tells him how long he may keep primary status.

If a user's group is full, but the system is not full,
he may be assigned "secondary" status and receive the message

     You are subject to preemption.

This warns him that a primary user may preempt (bump) him
in order to log in, if the system is full.

Users who are preempted are given a three-minute warning
before automatic logout, which looks like this:

     **********
     From Multics: Secondary user preemption.
     You will be logged out in 3 minutes.
     **********


Login decision:
I. System is not full
   A. Group is not full --> login as primary
   B. Group is full, search primary users of same group
      1. Found primary user with expired grace --> demote him
          to secondary and login as primary
      2. No user with expired grace --> login as secondary

II. System is full
   A. Group is not full --> must be a secondary on system,
       preempt him and login as primary
   B. Group is full, search primary users of same group
      1. Found primary user with expired grace --> preempt him
         and login as primary
      2. No user with expired grace --> sorry, system full. no login.

For preemption or demotion, the user who logged in first is the
first candidate.

Secondary users are promoted to primary if a primary user
from the same group logs out. Here too, the user who logged in first
is the one who is promoted.
