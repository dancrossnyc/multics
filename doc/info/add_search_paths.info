01/11/88  add_search_paths, asp

Syntax as a command:
  asp search_list search_path1 {-control_args} ...
       search_pathN {-control_args}


Function:	 adds one or more search paths to the specified search list.


Arguments:
search_list
   is the name of the search list to which the new search paths are
   added.
search_pathi
   specifies a new search path, where search_path1 is a relative or
   absolute pathname or a keyword (see "List of keywords" below).


Control arguments:	are used only after the search_path argument.  Only
   one is allowed for each search_path.
-after STR, -af STR
   positions the new search path after the search path denoted by STR.
-before STR, -be STR
   positions the new search path before the search path denoted by STR.
-first, -ft
   positions the new search path first in the search list.
-force, -fc
   causes duplicate pathnames to be replaced in the search list at the
   specified position.
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   suppresses warning messages printed when a pathname is nonexistent
   or is already in the search list.


-last, -lt
   positions the new search path last in the search list.  (Default)
-no_force, -nfc
   causes duplicate pathnames to be ignored.  (Default)
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   causes warning messages to be printed.  (Default)


List of keywords: The following are keywords accepted as search paths
   in place of absolute or relative pathnames:
   -home_dir, -hd
   -initiated_segments, -is
   -process_dir, -pd
   -referencing_dir, -rd
   -working_dir, -wd


Notes:  In addition, a pathname can be specified with the Multics
active function [user name] or [user project].  A search path enclosed
in quotes is not expanded when placed in the search list.  It is
expanded when referenced in your process.  This feature allows
search paths to be defined that identify the process directory or home
directory of any user.

If a link target does not exist, the search facility continues to
search for a matching entryname.

The -initiated_segments keyword may only be supplied for the linker
search list.
