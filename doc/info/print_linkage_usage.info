08/22/83  print_linkage_usage, plu

Syntax:  plu


Function:  lists the locations and size of linkage and static sections
allocated for the current ring.  This information is useful for
debugging purposes or for analysis of how a process uses its linkage
segments.

A linkage section is associated with every procedure segment and every
data segment that has definitions.


Notes:  For standard-procedure segments, the information printed
includes the name of the segment, its segment number, the offset of its
linkage section, and the size (in words) of both its linkage section
and its internal static storage.
