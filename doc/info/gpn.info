01/02/90	get_pathname, gpn


Syntax as a command:  gpn {-control_arg} arg


Syntax as an active function:  [gpn {-control_arg} arg]


Function:	 returns the absolute pathname of the segment designated by a
specified reference name or segment number.  (Reference names are
discussed in the MPM Reference Guide.)	If the reference name or
segment number is not in use, an error message is printed.


Arguments:
arg
   is a reference name or octal segment number known to this process.


Control arguments:
-name, -nm
   indicates that arg (which happens to look like an octal segment
   number) is to be interpreted as a reference name.  If this control
   argument is not specified, the system assumes arg is a reference
   name only if arg is not a valid octal number.


Notes:  Since the pathname is returned in quotes, the command processor
treats it as a single argument regardless of special characters in the
name.
