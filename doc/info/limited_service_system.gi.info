:Info: link_pair.gi: 02/24/82 link pair

     An indirect word in a procedure segment's linkage section through
which all references to some external data or procedure are made.
Until the link is snapped (i.e., connected), it contains symbolic
information about the external object.  A link pair initially contains
a code that causes a fault, and invokes the dynamic linker, when first
used in a process.  The linking, if successful, puts the actual
address of the procedure or data referenced in the link pair.


:Info: linkage_section.gi: 02/24/82 linkage section

     The portion of a procedure object segment that is a pure template
for impure data needed by the procedure at runtime.  The phrase also
refers to the impure copy made from this template.  See also
dynamic_linking.info.
