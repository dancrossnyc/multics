10/17/84  value_delete, vdl

Syntax as a command:  vdl {name} {-control_args}


Function: causes one or more names not to have defined values, as set
by value_set or value_get -call.


Arguments:
name
   is a character string.  It can be -name STR to specify a name
   beginning with a minus sign, to distinguish it from a control
   argument.  (See "Notes.")


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes data values set by value_$set_data as well as other values.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message "No match for starname."
-data
   deletes values set by value_$set_data, which you can list by giving
   -all or -data to value_list.  (Default: delete values set by
   value_set or value_$set)


-exclude STR, -ex STR
   deletes all existing values except those for names that match STR.
   If STR is surrounded by slashes (/), it is interpreted as a qedx
   regular expression to match names; otherwise, it is interpreted as a
   starname.  Only per-process values are deleted if you supply
   -perprocess, and only permanent ones if you give -permanent.  (See
   "Notes.")
-long, -lg
   allows the warning message "No match for starname."  (Default)


-match STR
   deletes all existing values for names that match STR.  If STR is
   surrounded by slashes, it is interpreted as a qedx regular
   expression to match names; otherwise, it is interpreted as a
   starname.  Only per-process values are deleted if you supply
   -perprocess, and only permanent ones if you give -permanent.  (See
   "Notes.")


-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies a value segment other than the current default one,
   without changing the default (see "Notes on Value Segment").
-permanent, -perm
   deletes only values stored in the value segment.
-perprocess, -pp
   deletes only per-process values.  The default is to delete the
   per-process value if one exists, otherwise to delete any permanent
   value.


Access required: You require rw access on the value segment except for
per-process values.


Notes: The -match and -exclude control arguments are applied in the
order specified.  Successive -match control arguments add to the set of
names processed (union), and successive -exclude control arguments
narrow down the set (intersection).  They are incompatible with the
name argument and can appear multiple times together.  (See
"Examples.")

See value_defined, value_get, value_list, value_path, value_set, and
value_set_path.


Notes on value segment: The value segment searched is either the one
specified by -pathname or the current default value segment.  The
default segment is initially
   [home_dir]>[user name].value
but you can change it by value_set_path.  Use of -pathname does not
change the default segment.
