10/23/75 Correspondence 2741's

Multics now supports Correspondence code 2741 terminals using
the 029 typeball. All 134 baud channels will be capable of running
either an EBCDIC or Correspondence 2741 and two new preaccess
requests have been defined to indicate which type is being used.


Preaccess requests: At dialup, the system will print the greeting
message in the installation defined code (i.e., EBCDIC or
Correspondence). If the user's terminal is the other code type, one
of the preaccess requests, 963 or 029, must be issued before the
login request. These requests indicate which code set is being used,
963 for EBCDIC or 029 for Correspondence. If an incorrect response is
received, the system prompts the user in both code sets for one of
the preaccess requests.


Escape conventions: Since Correspondence code does not contain all 94
printing ASCII graphics, some escape conventions have been chosen.
The following table lists the ASCII graphic being represented, the 
input and non-edited output escapes, and the edited output
representations. Note that the 2741 escape character is the cent-sign.

ASCII graphic     Escape     Edited output

left accent       \'         '

     Note that the circumflex uses the existing Correspondence
graphic plus-minus.
