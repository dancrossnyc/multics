:Entry: rehash_: 02/08/83 rehash_


Function: (reformats into a different size) a hash table of the form
that is maintained by the hash_ subroutine.  In most cases, hash_
calls rehash_ automatically when a table becomes too full.  For hash
tables that are embedded in larger data bases, the data base
maintainer must monitor the density of the hash table and call rehash_
when necessary to maintain the optimal table size.  See the
description of the hash_ subroutine for more information.


Syntax:
declare rehash_ entry (ptr, fixed bin, fixed bin(35));
call rehash_ (table_ptr, size, code);


Arguments:
table_ptr
   is a pointer to the table to be rehashed.  (Input)
size
   is the new size of the hash table.  (Input).  See the description of
   hash_$opt_size.
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output).  It can be:
   0
      table rehashed successfully.
   error_table_$invalid_elsize
      size is too large.
   error_table_$full_hashtbl
      size is not large enough to hold all the entries in the current
      hash table.
