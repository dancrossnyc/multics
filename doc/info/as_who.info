09/08/92  as_who

Syntax as a command:  as_who {-control_args} {User_ids}


Function: lists the contents of the answering service user tables--
answer_table, absentee_user_table, and daemon_user_table, in the
directory >sc1.


Arguments:
User_ids
   are access control names of the form
   Person_id.Project_id
      lists all users logged in with the specified Person_id and
      Project_id.  The star convention is allowed.
   Person_id
      lists all users logged in with the specified Person_id.  The star
      convention is allowed.
   .Project_id
      lists all users logged in with the specified Project_id.  The
      star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-absentee, -as
   prints the ratio of absentee users logged in to the number of
   absentee slots currently available and then lists the absentee
   users.
-channel chn_id, -chn chn_id
   lists only interactive users whose tty ID matches chn_id, daemon
   users whose source name (e.g., prta, vinc, etc) matches chn_id, or
   absentee users whose absentee name (e.g., abs1) matches chn_id.  The
   chn_id argument can be a starname to list several users.
-connected
   prints a list of connected processes only.
-cpu
   shows CPU usage in seconds for the listed processes.  It requires
   access to metering_gate_ or phcs_.


-daemon, -dmn
   prints the number of currently active daemon processes and then
   lists them.
-disconnected, -disc
   prints a list of disconnected processes only.
-group {name}, -gp {name}
   prints a list of users that fall under the specified load control
   group (see "Notes" below).
-idle
   shows how long, in seconds, the listed processes have been idle.
   It requires access to metering_gate_ or phcs_.
-interactive, -ia
   prints a list of all users having current interactive processes.


-long, -lg
   prints the long form of output including log-in time and tty ID.  If
   you give no -lg, the command prints the User_id
   (Person_id.Project_id) and flag for each user (see "Notes" below).
-name, -nm
   sorts the users by name.
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses column headings and load control heading from the printed
   output.
-pdir_volume {lv_name}, -pdv {lv_name}
   either includes in the output the name of the logical volume
   containing the user's process directory segments (if you give no
   lv_name argument) or prints information about only those users
   whose process directory segments are on the volume specified by the
   lv_name argument.


-process_id, -pid
   includes the process_ids of the listed processes.
-project, -pj
   sorts the users by project.
-secondary, -sc
   prints a list of all users having currently active secondary user
   processes (see "Notes" below).


Access required: Access to the user tables is usually restricted,
preventing you from using this command.  If you lack access to these
tables, use the who command to list the whotab segment in >sc1, which
is a public list of logged-in users.


Notes: As an active function, as_who returns Person_id.Project_id for
the processes selected for output, separated by spaces.

The default sort is by login time.

Anonymous users' true log-in names are shown, preceded by a *.

Specification of -long returns time of login, tty ID, weight, device
channel, load control group, flags indicating special variables, and a
User_id for each user.


Users should note the selection control arguments are usually additive.
E.g. as_who -connected -disconnected is equivalent to as_who
-interactive; as_who -as -daemon lists both absentee and deamon
processes, -daemon does not override the absentee selection.

Specification of any User_id will cause the headers to be suppressed.


Notes on flags: Included in the output next to the User_id are flags,
indicating preemption attributes (primary or secondary status) and the
current status of that user's process (these attributes vary according
to the login instance and the discretion of the project
administrator).  When you invoke as_who with -long, the column listing
these flags has the heading "PNDS." The flags in these four-column
positions indicate the user's status with respect to Preemption,
Nolist, Disconnected, and Suspended statuses.  Additionally if you
select -idle, R and W flags can occur.  An R flag indicates the process
is ready; a W flag indicates the process is waiting for another event.


List of preemption attribute flags:
<blank>
   indicates that the user has primary status.
S
   indicates that the user has secondary status.
+
   the user has the nobump attribute (cannot be preempted).
>
   the user, whose grace period has run out, is subject to bumping
   (preemption).
X
   the user has been bumped but has not yet logged out.
D
   identifies a daemon user.


List of nolist flags:
<blank>
   the user does not have the nolist attribute.
N
   the user has the nolist attribute.


List of disconnected flags:
<blank>
   the user is not disconnected.
D
   the user is disconnected.


List of suspended flags:
<blank>
   the user is not suspended.
S
   the user is suspended.
