Syntax:  files star_names {-control_arg{s}}


Syntax as active function:  [files star_names {-control_arg{s}}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of segments and
multisegment files that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_names
   are star names to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.
-chase
   will process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
-no_chase
   will not process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
   (Default)


Notes:  Only one name per file is returned; i.e., if a file has more
than one name that matches a star_name, only the first match found is
returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by files is enclosed in
quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.
