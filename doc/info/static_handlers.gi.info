07/07/75  Static Handlers

A new feature has been added to the system which improves the system's
performance with respect to its handling of certain user-ring system
conditions. The user-interface change externally visible is in the signalling
of certain system events. In particular, "alrm" and "cput" are no longer
signalled, but are rather handled directly by system code. Similarly, there is
a change in the signalling of "no_write_permission" and "not_in_write_bracket"
such that these, also are not signalled IF THE SEGMENT CAUSING THE CONDITION TO
BE RAISED HAS ITS COPY SWITCH ON (type "help copy_on_write").
  Handlers for "cput" and "alrm" used to be established in the process overseer
of a process. This reuqired users wishing to write their own process overseer
to know that this was necessary. This strategy has changed such that the
"real_init_admin" program for a process takes on this task thereby relieving
writers of process overseer programs from knowing about this special process
(ring) initialization requirement.
  Process overseers that establish timer_manager_ as the handler for "cput" and
"alrm" will continue to work although this effort is no longer necessary and
indeed ignored. If a process overseer establishes any other procedure as the
handler for these conditions, this no longer works in the same fashion.
