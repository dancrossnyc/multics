Access required: You need modify permission on the parent directory.


Notes: Two entries in a directory cannot have the same entryname;
therefore, add_name takes special action if the added name already
exists.  If the added name is an alternate name of another entry, the
name is removed from this entry, added to the entry specified by path,
and you are informed of this action.  If the added name is the only
name of another entry, you are asked whether to delete this entry.  If
you answer "yes", the entry is deleted and the name is added to the
entry specified by path; if you answer "no", no action is taken.

See the delete_name and rename commands.
