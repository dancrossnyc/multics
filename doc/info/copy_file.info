02/11/85  copy_file, cpf

Syntax as a command:
   cpf in_control_arg out_control_arg {-control_args}


Function: copies records from an input file to an output file that has
been restructured for maximum compactness.  The input and output file
records must be structured (see "Notes on unstructured files" below).
The input file can be copied either partially or in its entirety.


Arguments:
in_control_arg
   the input file from which records are read can be specified by
   either of the following:
   -input_switch STR, -isw STR
      specifies the input file by means of an already-attached I/O
      switch name, where STR is the switch name.
   -input_description STR, -ids STR
      specifies the input file by means of an attach description STR.
      STR must be enclosed in quotes if it contains spaces or other
      command language characters.


out_control_arg
   the output file to which the records are written can be specified by
   either of the following:
   -output_switch STR, -osw STR
      specifies the output file by means of an already-attached I/O
      switch name, where STR is the switch name.
   -output_description STR, -ods STR
      specifies the output file by means of an attach description STR.
      STR must be enclosed in quotes if it contains spaces or other
      command language characters.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   copies until the input file is exhausted.  (Default)
-brief, -bf
   suppresses a message indicating the number of records or lines
   actually copied.
-count N, -ct N
   copies until N records have been copied or the input file is
   exhausted, whichever occurs first, where N is a positive integer.
   (Default: to copy until the input file is exhausted)
-from N, -fm N
   copies records beginning with the Nth record of the input file,
   where N is a positive integer.  (See "Notes.") (Default: to begin
   copying with the "next record")


-keyed
   copies both records and keys from a keyed sequential input file to a
   keyed sequential output file.  (See "Notes on keyed files.")
   (Default: to copy records from an input file, keyed or not, to a
   sequential output file)
-long, -lg
   prints a message indicating the number of records or lines actually
   copied: "345 records copied".  (Default)
-start STR, -sr STR
   copies records beginning with the record whose key is STR, where STR
   is 256 or fewer ASCII characters.  (Default: to begin copying with
   the "next record")


-stop STR, -sp STR
   copies until the record whose key is STR has been copied or the
   input file is exhausted, whichever occurs first, where STR is 256 or
   fewer ASCII characters.  This control argument can be given without
   specifying -start.  However, if -start is supplied, the STR used
   with -stop must be greater than or equal to (according to the ASCII
   collating sequence) the STR given with -start.
-to N
   copies until the Nth record has been copied or the input file is
   exhausted, whichever occurs first, where N is a positive integer
   greater than or equal to the N given with -from.  If you use -to,
   you must give -from.


Notes: If either the input or output specification is an attach
description, it is used to attach a uniquely named I/O switch to the
file.  The switch is opened, the copy performed, and then the switch is
closed and detached.  Alternately the input or output file can be
specified by an I/O switch name.  Use either io_call or iox_ to attach
the file prior to the invocation of copy_file.

If the input file is specified by an I/O switch name and the switch is
not open, copy_file opens it for (keyed_)sequential_input, performs the
copy, and closes it.  If the switch is already open when copy_file is
invoked, the opening mode must be sequential_input,
sequential_input_output, keyed_sequential_input, or
keyed_sequential_update.  The switch is not closed after the copy has
been performed.


The "next record" must be defined if neither -start nor -from is
specified as the absolute starting position within the input file.  If
the I/O switch is opened by copy_file, the next record is the first
record of the file; otherwise the next record is the one at which the
file is positioned when copy_file is invoked.


If the output file is specified by an I/O switch name and the switch is
not open, copy_file opens it for (keyed_)sequential_output, performs
the copy, and closes it.  If the switch is already open when copy_file
is invoked, the opening mode must be sequential_output,
sequential_input_output, keyed_sequential_output,
keyed_sequential_update, direct_output, or direct_update.  (In update
mode, output file records with keys that duplicate input file records
are rewritten.)  The switch is not closed after the copy has been
performed.

The following control arguments are mutually exclusive-- -from and
-start; -to, -stop, -count, and -all; -brief and -long.


Notes on unstructured files: This command operates by performing
record I/O on structured files.  If you want to copy from/to an
unstructured file, you can use the record_stream_ I/O module:
   cpf -ids "record_stream_ -target vfile_ pathname" -osw OUT
which takes lines from the file specified by pathname via the vfile_
I/O module, transforms them into records via the record_stream_ I/O
module, and copies them to the I/O switch named OUT.


Notes on keyed files: The command can copy a keyed sequential file to
produce an output file that has been restructured for maximum
compactness as a keyed file or as though it were sequential.  By
default it copies only records and does not place keys in the output
file.  To copy the keys, use -keyed.  When you select -keyed the input
file must be a keyed sequential file.  Whether keys are copied or not,
choose control arguments to delimit the range of records to be copied
(e.g., -start, -stop).  Copying is always performed in key order.

If the keyed file has keys but no records (e.g., a dictionary file),
the file, its keys, and its associated record descriptors are copied.
