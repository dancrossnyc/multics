01/30/84  channel_comm_meters

Syntax:  channel_comm_meters channel_name {-control_args}


Function:  prints out metering information for a specified
communications channel or channels.


Arguments:
channel_name
   is the name of the channel for which information is to be printed.
   If it is the name of an FNP, totals for that FNP are reported.  If
   channel_name is a starname, information for every channel matching
   the starname is printed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   causes a reduced amount of information to be printed for each
   specified channel.
-error
   causes only those meters to be printed that reflect error
   conditions.
-since_bootload, -boot
   prints the meters accumulated since each channel's parent
   multiplexer (or, in the case of an FNP, the system) was last loaded.
   This control argument is incompatible with -since_dialup (below).


-since_dialup, -dial
   prints the meters accumulated since the channel last dialed up.
   This is the default.  This control argument is incompatible with
   -since_bootload (above).
-summary, -sum
   causes a one-line summary to be printed for each specified channel.
   This control argument may not be specified if either -brief or
   -error is specified.


Notes:  If a single channel is specified, the caller must either be the
current user of the specified channel or have access to either the
metering_gate_ gate or the phcs_ gate.  If a starname is specified, the
user must have access to one of the above-named gates.

If -brief and -error are both specified, then only those error
indications that would be printed with -brief are printed.  See the
example below.
