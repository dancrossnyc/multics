Syntax:  .ifi l0toc "title"


Function:
These macros add a section or paragraph title to the Table of Contents
at the appropriate level.


Arguments:
'title' is the section-title or paragraph-title exactly as it is to
   appear in the Table of Contents.


Notes:
1) These macros are used to generate entries in the Table of Contents
   when, for any reason (such as the use of the equivalent 'exact'
   macro), the accompanying section or paragraph heading is not wanted
   in the text.  They may also be used to generate entries for sections
   as yet unwritten or to be provided.	The macros should be inserted
   immediately AFTER the title is placed in the text, or inserted where
   the unwritten section or paragraph belongs.


Examples:
A paragraph describing the qedx editor might begin:

        .ifi l3exact "USING THE qedx COMMAND"
        .ifi l3toc "Using the qedx Command"

(END)
