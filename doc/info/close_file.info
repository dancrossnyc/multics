02/06/85  close_file, cf

Syntax as a command:  cf {-control_arg} filenames


Function: closes specified FORTRAN, Pascal, and PL/I files.  It closes
all open FORTRAN, Pascal, and PL/I files if you give -all.


Arguments:
filenames
   are the names of open FORTRAN, Pascal, or PL/I files.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   closes all open files.  In this case, no filename appears.


Notes: The format of a FORTRAN file name is fileNN, where NN is a
two-digit number other than 00; e.g., file05.  PL/I and Pascal file
names are selected by you and can have any format.

If a specified file cannot be found, an error message is printed
indicating the name of the file.  The rest of the specified files are
closed.

For each filename, all PL/I and Pascal files of that name and, if
applicable, the FORTRAN file of that name are closed.

The command "close_file -all" does not affect I/O switches that are not
associated with FORTRAN, Pascal, or PL/I files.
