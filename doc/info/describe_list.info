10/20/86 describe_list, dls

Syntax as a command:  dls path {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [dls path {-control_args}]


Function:  displays information about a lister file.  As an active
function, return information about a lister file.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file.  The suffix lister must be the
   last component of the lister segment name; however, if path does not
   have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-delimiter {record|field}, -dm {record|field}
   displays the value of the record or field delimiter.  If the record
   and field keywords are omitted, then both delimiters are printed.
-field_name, -fn
   displays the field_names in the lister file.
-header, -he
   prints a heading line.  A header is normally printed if none of -dm,
   -tt and -fn are specified.
-no_header
   omits the heading line.
-select STR, -sel STR
   specifies those records to be indicated by the -total control
   argument.  If this control argument is not specified, then the total
   number of records in the file is used.


-total, -tt
   displays the total number of records.


Notes:  If no control arguments are given, or only the -select control
argument is given, then the record and field delimiters, total, and the
field names are displayed.


If none or more than one of -delimiter {record|field}, -total, or
-field_name are specified, the values are returned in the following
order:  record_delimiter, field_delimiter, total, and field_names.


The describe_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.  A
severity of 2 is set when the information is not returned or the
invocation of describe_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 1 is
set when the information is returned but no records match the selection
expression.  A severity of 0 is set when the information is returned
and at least one record matches the selection expression.
