:Entry: get_lock_id_: 02/02/84  get_lock_id_


Function: returns the 36-bit unique lock identifier to be used by a
process in setting locks.  By using this lock identifier, a convention
can be established so that a process wishing to lock a data base and
finding it already locked can verify that the lock is set by an
existing process.


Syntax:
declare get_lock_id_ entry (bit(36) aligned);
call get_lock_id_ (lock_id);


Arguments:
lock_id
   is the unique identifier of this process used in locking.  (Output)


Notes:  For a more detailed discussion of locking see the set_lock_
subroutine description.
