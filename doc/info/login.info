Syntax:  l Person_id{.Project_id} {-control_args}


Function:  gives you access to the system.  It is a request to the
answering service to start your identification procedure and then
either create a process for you or connect the terminal to your
disconnected process.  The command line can be up to 300 characters
long.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is your registered personal identifier, which can be replaced by a
   registered "login alias" if you have one.
Project_id
   is the identification of your project.  If you don't give it, the
   default project associated with the Person_id is used.  (See
   -change_default_project.)


List of general control arguments:  The following are permitted in any
use of the login command:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages associated with a successful login except the
   ones indicating that you have incorrectly specified your password
   and the ones indicating all your login attempts with the same
   Person_id.  If you are using the standard process overseer, the
   message of the day is not printed.
-change_default_auth, -cda
   changes your registered default login authorization to the one
   specified by -authorization.  If you give a valid authorization, the
   default authorization is changed for subsequent logins and the
   message "default authorization changed" is printed.  If you give
   -cda without -authorization, an error message is printed.


-change_default_project, -cdp
   changes your default project to the Project_id specified on this
   login request line.  The default Project_id is changed for
   subsequent logins, and the message "default project changed" is
   printed.  If you specify -cdp without a Project_id, an error message
   is printed.
-change_password, -cpw
   changes your password to a new one.  The login request asks for the
   old password before it requests the new one, twice, to verify the
   spelling.  If you don't type it the same way both times, the login
   and the password change are refused.  If the old password is
   correct, the new one replaces the old for subsequent logins and the
   message "password changed" is printed.  Don't type the new password
   as part of the control argument.  (See "Notes on Passwords" below.)


-generate_password, -gpw
   changes your password to a new one, generated for you by the system.
   The login request asks for the old password first; then, a new
   password is generated and typed on your terminal.  You are asked to
   retype the new password, to verify having seen it.  If you type it
   correctly, it replaces the old for subsequent logins and the message
   "password changed" is printed.  If you mistype it, the login and
   password change are refused.
-long, -lg
   reverses the effect of -brief, or the brief attribute in the project
   definition table (see the MAM Project, AK51).


-modes STR, -mode STR, -md STR
   sets the I/O modes associated with your terminal to STR, where STR
   consists of modes acceptable to the tty_ I/O module (see the set_tty
   command).  STR is usually a list of modes separated by commas; it
   must not contain blanks.  (See "Examples.")
-no_print_off, -npf
   overtypes a string of characters to provide a black area for you to
   type the password.
-no_warning, -nw
   suppresses even urgent system warning messages and emergency
   messages from the operator, both at login and during your session.
   Give this argument when using a remote computer to simulate a
   terminal or when typing out long memoranda, when the process output
   should not be interrupted by even serious messages.


-print_off, -pf
   suppresses overtyping for the password.  (Default:  depends on the
   terminal type)
-terminal_id STR, -tid STR
   sets your terminal identification to STR.  This control argument is
   illegal if the site has specified answerback checking.
-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   sets your terminal type to STR, where STR is any terminal type name
   defined in the standard terminal type table.  This control argument
   overrides the default terminal type.
-warning
   reverses the effect of -no_warning, or the no_warning attribute in
   the project definition table (see the MAM Project, AK51).


List of control arguments for process creation:

Use the following when requesting the creation of a new process.
-arguments STR, -ag STR
   supplies arguments to the process; STR can be one or more arguments.
   If you use -arguments, put it last because everything following it
   on the command line is taken as arguments to the process.  The
   process can determine the number and value of each argument with the
   login_args active function.


-authorization STR, -auth STR
   sets the authorization of the process to that specified by STR; STR
   is a character string composed of level and category names for the
   desired authorization, separated by commas.  STR cannot contain any
   embedded blank or tab characters.  (The short names for each level
   and category always contain no blanks or tabs, and can be used
   whenever the corresponding long names contain blanks or tabs.)  STR
   must represent an authorization that is less than or equal to the
   maximum authorization of Person_id on the Project_id.  If
   -authorization is omitted, your registered default login
   authorization is used.  (See the Programmer's Reference Manual for
   more information about process authorizations.)


-force
   logs you in, provided you have the guaranteed login attribute.  Only
   system users who perform emergency repair functions have the
   necessary attribute.
-home_dir path, -hd path
   sets your home directory to the path specified if your project
   administrator allows it.
-no_save_on_disconnect, -nosave
   logs your process out instead of saving it if it is disconnected
   from its login terminal.  This control argument is used to override
   a default of -save if that default has been set by your project
   administrator.
-no_preempt, -np
   does not log you in if you might preempt somebody in this user's
   load control group.


-no_start_up, -ns
   instructs the standard process overseer not to execute your
   start_up.ec segment if the project administrator allows it.
-outer_module path, -om path
   attaches your terminal via the outer module named path rather than
   your registered outer module if you are allowed.
-process_overseer path, -po path
   sets your process overseer to the procedure given by path if your
   project administrator allows it.  If path ends in the characters
   ",direct", the specified procedure is called directly during process
   initialization rather than by the standard system-provided
   procedure.  This means that the program used by path must perform
   the tasks that would have been performed by the standard procedure.
   The combined length of the -po and -ss character strings must be
   less than 64 characters.


-ring N, -rg N
   sets your initial ring to N if this ring number is greater than or
   equal to your registered initial ring and less than your registered
   maximum ring.
-save_on_disconnect, -save
   saves your process if it is disconnected from its login terminal
   because of a communications line hangup or FNP crash.  Your project
   administrator gives permission to use the process-saving facility
   and to enable it by default.  (See -nosave and the
   save_on_disconnect and no_save_on_disconnect commands.)
-subsystem path, -ss path
   creates your process using the prelinked subsystem in the directory
   specified by path if your project administrator allows it.  To
   override a default subsystem specified by the project administrator,
   type -ss "".


List of control arguments for disconnected processes:  Use the
following to specify the disposition of disconnected processes (see
"Notes on Disconnected Processes" below):
-connect {N}
   connects the terminal to your disconnected process.  If more than
   one such process exists, indicate the process number N.
-create
   creates a new process without destroying any disconnected ones.
   This is permitted only if you are allowed to have multiple
   interactive processes.
-destroy {N}
   destroys your disconnected process and logs out.  If more than one
   such process exists, specify the process number N.


-immediate
   bypasses termination of the existing process by the trm_ IPS signal
   (which causes running of finish and epilogue handlers in the
   existing process) and instead tells the hardcore to destroy the
   existing process immediately.
-list
   lists your disconnected process, its number, the time of the
   original login, and the ID of the channel and terminal that were
   last connected to the process.
-new_proc {N}
   destroys your disconnected process and creates a new one.  If more
   than one such process exists, give the process number N.


Notes:  Unless you already have one or more processes, login creates a
process for you.  The load control mechanism is consulted to determine
if the creation of your process overloads either the system or your
load control group.


If the mechanism allows it, a process is created for you and the
terminal is connected to it (i.e., the terminal is placed under that
process's control).  (See "List of Control Arguments for Process
Creation" above.)


You might have a disconnected process because of a phone line hangup or
an FNP crash.  Then, you can choose among the following alternatives:
connecting the terminal to the process; destroying the disconnected
process, with or without creating a new one; or logging out without
affecting the disconnected process (see "List of Control Arguments for
Disconnected Processes" above and "Notes on Disconnected Processes"
below).


If you specify neither -pf nor -npf at log-in, the system chooses the
option most appropriate for your terminal type.


Several parameters of your process, as noted above, can be controlled
by your project administrator; for example, allowing you to override
attributes by specifying control arguments on the login line.


If the project administrator does not allow you to use -hd -om, -po,
-rg, -save, or -ss or does allow you to give one or more of them and
you specify them incorrectly, a message is printed and the login is
refused.


Notes on passwords:  The login request asks you for a password and
ensures either that the password does not appear on your terminal or
that it is thoroughly hidden in a string of cover-up characters.  The
password is a string of one to eight characters, which can be any
character from the ASCII character set (including the backspace) except
space and semicolon.  The password used for interactive logins cannot
be "quit", "help", "HELP", or "?"  because these have special meaning
to the password processor.  Typing "quit" terminates the login attempt;
"help", "HELP", or "?"  produces an explanatory message and repeats the
request for the password.


After you type the password the answering service looks up the
Person_id, the Project_id, and the password in its tables and verifies
that the Person_id and the Project_id are valid, that you are a legal
user of the project, and that the password given matches the registered
password.  If these tests succeed, you are logged in.


Notes on disconnected processes:  If your project administrator allows
it, your process can be preserved when it becomes disconnected from its
terminal.  You can call back any time before the installation-defined
maximum inactive time and ask to be reconnected.  This feature is
controlled by -save and -nosave; your project administrator sets the
default.


If your project administrator allows you to have several interactive
processes simultaneously, you can have more than one disconnected
process.  Multiple disconnected processes are numbered consecutively
starting with 1, in the order of their login times.  Use these process
numbers as arguments when referring to one of a set of multiple
disconnected processes.  The number and login time of each is printed
by -list or the "list" request.  You can, however, anticipate the
number and use it with a control argument.  The time listed and sorted
on is the time of the original login from which the process is
descended; this time is not affected by new_proc or reconnection.


List of requests for disconnected processes:  If you do not specify on
the login line what to do with the disconnected processes, you are told
of the disconnected processes and given these choices:
connect {N}
   to connect the terminal to a disconnected process
create
   to create an additional process
destroy {N} {-control_args}
   to destroy a disconnected process and log out
help
   to print a description of these options
list
   to list your disconnected processes
logout {-control_args}
   to log out without affecting any process


new_proc {N} {-control_args}
   to destroy a disconnected process, create a new one with the same
   attributes, and connect the terminal to it.


When issued from a logged-in but disconnected terminal, the help
request explains these options, not how to log in.


List of control arguments for disconnected process requests:
-hold, -hd
   prevents the breaking of the connection between the terminal and the
   answering service.  You can use it only with destroy and logout.
   (Default)
-immediate
   bypasses termination of the existing process by the trm_ IPS signal
   (which causes running of finish and epilogue handlers in the
   existing process) and instead tells the hardcore to destroy the
   existing process immediately.  You can use it only with destroy and
   new_proc.
-no_hold, -nhd
   drops the connection.  You can use it only with destroy and logout.
