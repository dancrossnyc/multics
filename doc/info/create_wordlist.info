10/20/86  create_wordlist, cwl


Syntax as a command:  cwl path {-control_args}


Function:  produces an alphabetized list of all distinct words found in
the specified text segment.  This list is saved in a wordlist segment
that is created in the working directory.  The wordlist segment is
given the entryname of the text segment with a suffix of wl added.  The
total number of words in the text segment and the number of words put
into the wordlist segment are displayed.


Arguments:
where path is the pathname of the text segment or MSF.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the display of the total number of words in the text
   segment and the number of words put into the wordlist segment.
-from n, -fm n
   words are processed in the text segment starting from the line
   number specified by n.  If this control argument is not specified,
   then the text segment is processed starting from the first line.
-header, -he
   displays the pathname of the text segment.
-no_control_lines, -ncl
   suppresses the display of the control lines.


-no_exclude, -ne
   specifies that words containing only special characters or
   punctuation are not to be excluded from the wordlist.
-no_sort, -ns
   specifies that the words in the wordlist segment are not to be
   sorted into alphabetical order.  They are put into the wordlist
   segment in the order in which they are found in the text segment and
   duplications are not eliminated.  (This control argument is intended
   for special application and should not be used for normal wordlist
   segment creation.)
-temp_dir path, -td path
   path holds the temporary segment if the input file is an MSF.
   (Default is the process directory.)


-to n
   words are processed in the text segment up to and including the line
   number specified by n.  If this control argument is not specified,
   then the text segment is processed to the last line.


Notes:  Words in the text segment are separated by the following
delimiter (white space) characters:

   space
   horizontal tab
   vertical tab
   newline
   form feed


Punctuation characters are removed from the word.  The characters "([{
are removed from the left side of the word.  The characters ")]}.,;:?!
are removed from the right side of the word.  Also, PAD characters
(octal 177) are removed from the left side of the word.  Additional
special processing is performed on each word after all punctuation is
removed.  A summary of this special processing is given below:

     if the entire word is underscored, then the underscores are
     removed.  If only part of a word is underscored, then the
     underscores remain.

     if the word contains no letters, i.e., consists entirely of
     punctuation characters or other special characters, then the word
     is excluded from the wordlist.  The -no_exclude control argument
     disables the automatic exclusion of such words.
