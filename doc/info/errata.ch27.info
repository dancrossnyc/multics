          Errata Information for MR12.4


pg 17-20.1:  replace the current "comout-command" (^X^E) and add  |
     "comout-command-to-buffer" (^U^X^E), both as presented       |
     below.                                                       |
                                                                  |
     ^X^E    comout-command                                       |
             Executes a Multics command line (prompted for, end   |
             with CR), and places the output in a buffer; if the  |
             command line is empty this request is aborted.  The  |
             output is placed in the buffer "file_output";        |
             however, if the command is given a numeric argument  |
             (e.g.  ^U^X^E) the "comout-command-to-buffer"        |
             command (see below) is executed.  The file_output    |
             buffer is made the current buffer.                   |


     ^U^X^E  comout-command-to-buffer                             |
             This is like "comout-command", except the user is    |
             prompted for the name of a buffer (which is used     |
             instead of "file_output").  This can be made the     |
             normal operation of ^X^E by placing the following    |
             line in the start_up.emacs (see Appendix G for more  |
             information on the start_up.emacs):                  |
             (set-permanent-key "^X^E" comout-command-to-buffer)  |


pg B-5 to B-6:  add the following RMAIL mode commands.

     ?   rmail-help
         Displays as printout a brief description of each of the
         RMAIL mode commands.

     x   rmail-toggle-seen
         Toggles the "Seen" switch of the current message being
         read.  The state of this switch is indicated as minor
         mode "Seen" in the RMAIL buffer.


     f   rmail-forward
         Forwards the current message to a list of addresses
         which are prompted for in the mini-buffer.
         Redistribution comments can be added by supplying a
         numeric argument (e.g., 3f).  A comment buffer which
         allows the use of ^X^Q (quit), ^X^A (acknowledge), and
         ^X^S (send) will be created.


pg B-7:  replace the first paragraph of the page with the
     following.

     Once you have invoked the r request, you can use the MAIL
     mode requests as well as the standard Emacs requests.  In
     addition, the following requests are available (refer to the
     individual rmail request to determine which of these
     requests are valid).


pg B-7:  add the following RMAIL command description.

     ^X^A rmail-toggle-ack
     In a mail-mode or forwarding comments buffer, toggles the
     "Ack" request of the mail.


pg B-7:  replace the description of ^X^S with the following.

     ^X^S send-the-mail, foward-the-mail
     Sends the reply, or forwards the message and comments, and
     returns to RMAIL and its window.


pg C-9 & C-12:  replace the description of "ESC ^C" with the      |
     following.                                                   |
                                                                  |
     ESC ^C  compile-buffer                                       |
             Compiles the buffer.  Writes the current buffer out  |
             to its default pathname (as for ^X^S), and then      |
             compiles it.  Compiler diagnostics are placed in the |
             buffer "Compilation Errors" if the option            |
             "one-error-scan-buffer" is On (the default); if it   |
             is Off then the diagnostics are placed in the buffer |
             "<name> Errors", where <name> is replaced with the   |
             name of the buffer being compiled.  (This allows     |
             several buffers to be compiled without overwriting   |
             each other's messages.)  If in two-window mode, the  |


             error buffer is displayed in another window; if the  |
             option "compile-two-windows" is On (the default is   |
             Off) then this command will automatically enter      |
             two-window mode if necessary.  If the                |
             "compile-local-display" option is On (default is     |
             Off) and "compile-two-windows" is Off, the error     |
             messages will be displayed as a local display (in    |
             addition to being put in a buffer).  If neither is   |
             set (the default), a one-line local display will     |
             indicate whether the compilation was successful.     |
             The extended requests "ESC X set-compiler" and       |
             "ESC X set-compile-options" can be used to select    |
             the compiler and options to be used.                 |


pg C-9 & C-13:  Remove the following sentence from the            |
     description of ^X^D.                                         |
                                                                  |
     Since this mode locks the buffer used for compilations, you  |
     are strongly advised to exit it when you are finished.       |
