01/27/84  reconnect_ec_enable

Syntax:  reconnect_ec_enable


Function:  invokes a search for the reconnect.ec segment upon
reconnection to a disconnected process.  The search begins in the home
directory, continues through the project directory, and then through
>sc1 until the segment is located, at which time the command "exec_com
>DIRECTORY_NAME>reconnect.ec" is executed.


Notes:  The reconnect_ec_enable command reverses the effect of the
reconnect_ec_disable command.

Use of reconnect.ec is enabled automatically by the standard process
overseer procedure process_overseer_.  Invocation of reconnect.ec is
not automatically enabled by the project_start_up_ process overseer
(see Section 7 of the MAM -- Project Administrator Manual, Order No.
AK51).  Thus, when using project_start_up_, the project administrator
may enable invocation of reconnect.ec at any point in the
project_start_up.ec.

The current command processor is used to execute the command.  Thus, if
the user is using the abbrev command processor, any applicable
abbreviation will be executed.
