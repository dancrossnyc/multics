10/02/85  Lister

Lister is a set of commands that create, maintain, process, and
produce online lists of information (names, words, etc.).

You can use Lister to produce simple reports.  You can print the
documents on your terminal, save them in a segment, mail them to other
users, or use them for further processing by runoff or compose.


Lister lists: The four elements in a lister list are--
   1. list: a header record and a series of data records.
   2. header record: the first record in a list; it contains data
      record and field delimiter characters.
   3. data records (or records): any number of records that are allowed
      in a list and that are made up of fields.
   4. fields: lowest level of data in a list, e.g., name, address,
      phone number.


Lister files: Lister uses three types of files--
   1. listin: an ASCII file used to input and update a list.  It is
      identified by the ".listin" suffix.
   2. lister: a file containing a list in a form that Lister can
      process.  It is identified by the ".lister" suffix.
   3. listform: a file that defines the format of a document produced
      from a list.  It is identified by the ".listform" suffix.
