02/13/84  add_mail_table_entry

Syntax:  add_mail_table_entry name {address} {-control_args}


Function:  adds an entry to the mail table and specifies the entry's
mailing address.  This command is used by system administrators to
specify names, usually names of users on other systems, that can be
used to designate mailboxes (Person_id.Project_id), mailing lists, and
Forum meetings.  The name must not already exist in the mail table or
the person name table (PNT).  Names are not distinguished by case
(e.g., Sackman and sackman are the same name).


Arguments:
name
   is a string that specifies the name to be given to this mail table
   entry.  It must be enclosed in quotation marks if it contains blank
   spaces.
address
   is a destination specifier, that is, a mailing address in the form
   used by the -mailbox or -user control arguments (see below).  It can
   be used instead of the -mailbox or -user control arguments.


Control arguments:
-acs_path path
   specifies the Access Control Segment (ACS) which controls who may
   update the entry's mail address.  rw access to the ACS indicates
   that a user may update the entry.  If this is not specified or is
   the null string, only users with access to mail_table_priv_ may
   update the entry.
-alias name
   specifies an alternate name for the name being defined.  If this
   control argument is specified multiple times, all the names are
   defined as aliases for the entry.
-log path
   specifies the pathname of a logbox and is equivalent to
   -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx


-mailing_list path, -mls path
   specifies the name of a mailing list.  The suffix "mls" is added if
   necessary.  The archive component pathname convention is accepted.
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix "mbx" is added if
   necessary.
-meeting path, -mtg path
   specifies the pathname of a Forum meeting.  The suffix "control" is
   added if necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix "sv.mbx" is added
   if necessary.


STR -at FSystem {-via RelayN...-via Relay1}
   specifies an address on another computer system.  STR identifies the
   user (or group of users) to receive the message and is not
   interpreted in any way by the local system.  FSystem is the name of
   the foreign system where the address is located.  If the optional
   -via control arguments are not present, FSystem must be one of the
   names of a foreign system in the local system's network information
   table (NIT).  If, however, the -via control arguments are specified,
   the foreign system name does not need to be known to the local
   system.


   If the -via control arguments are specified, they identify an
   explicit route to be used to reach the foreign system.  In this
   case, Relay1 must be one of the names of a foreign system in the
   local system's NIT.  Mail destined for this foreign address is
   forwarded to the system identified in Relay1.  From there it is
   forwarded to the system identified as Relay2, etc.  until it reaches
   the system identified as RelayN, where it is delivered to the system
   on which the foreign address actually resides.  When the NIT is
   querried for either FSystem or Relay1, the query is performed in a
   case insensitive manner.
-user Person_id.Project_id
   specifies the given user's default mailbox under the specified
   project.  This control argument is equivalent to
   -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx


Access required:  The user must have e access to the gate
mail_table_priv_.
