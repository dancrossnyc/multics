02/13/85  last_message_sender, lms

Syntax as a command:  lms {mbx_specification}


Syntax as an active function:  [lms {mbx_specification}]


Function: returns the sender of the last message received (from
send_message) in the form "Person_id.Project_id" (e.g., GBShaw.Demo).


Arguments:
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox on which messages are to be accepted.  If not
   given, the user's default mailbox (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx)
   is used.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to
      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.


-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.


Notes: You are cautioned against using the active function when in
polite mode.  In this mode the system holds all messages until you
finish typing a line (i.e., until the carriage is at the left margin);
therefore it is possible that while you are sending a message, your
process receive another message from another user--a message not yet
seen.  By using the active function in this situation, you can
inadvertently attribute a message to the wrong person.

See accept_messages, last_message, last_message_time, and send_message.
