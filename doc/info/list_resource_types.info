Function: prints a list of all resource types described in a resource
type description table (RTDT).


Arguments:
type1
   is the resource type defined in the RTDT for which information is to
   be listed.  If you give no type, all known resource types are
   listed.


Control arguments:
-long, -lg
   lists the defined attributes for each resource type.
-no_header, -nhe
   omits the column headers.
-pathname path, -pn path
   lists resource types defined in the RTDT specified by path.  If you
   give no -pathname, the RTDT residing in >system_control_1 is used.


Notes: See also the list_resources command, which lists groups of
resources according to specified criteria.  For example, list_resources
can list all resources known by the Resource Control Package (RCP) or
those owned by a given user and/or project.
