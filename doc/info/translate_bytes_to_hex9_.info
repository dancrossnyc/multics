:Entry: translate_bytes_to_hex9_: 06/26/86  translate_bytes_to_hex9_

Function: translates a bit string to a character string
containing the hexadecimal representation of the bits.
Each 9-bit byte of the input is translated into two hex
digits by using the low-order 8 bits in each byte.


Syntax:
declare translate_bytes_to_hex9_ entry (bit (*), char (*));
call translate_bytes_to_hex9_ (bit_string, hex_string);


Arguments:
bit_string
   is the bit string to be translated.  This argument must start on a
   byte boundary and should be a multiple of 9 bit long.  Any extra
   bits, not part of a complete byte, are ignored.  (Input)
hex_string

   is the output character string containing hexadecimal digits
   obtained by translating the low order 8 bits of each 9-bit byte of
   the input string into 2 hex digits.  If the output string argument
   is longer than necessary, then it is filled with ASCII "0"
   characters.  (Output)


Notes:  This subroutine uses the hardware mvt instruction with a desc4a
descriptor for the input string and a desc9a descriptor for the output
string to do the translation.
