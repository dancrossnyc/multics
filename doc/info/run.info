Syntax:  run {-control_args} {main_program} {program_args}


Function: provides temporary environment for execution of programs.


Arguments: 
main_program
   pathname of the main program for the run.
program_args
   arguments passed to the exec_com or main program.


Control arguments: 
-exec_com path, -ec path
   specifies the exec_com to be executed.
-no_exec_com, -nec
   invokes the main program directly.
-limit n, -li n
   interrupts run every n seconds of virtual CPU time.
-copy_reference_names, -crn
   starts run with copy of reference names initiated before run and
   automatically terminates segments initiated only with the run unit.
-new_reference_names, -nrn
   uses a different reference name table and automatically terminates
   segments initiated only within the run unit. (DEFAULT)
-old_reference_names, -orn
   uses original reference name table directly and does not automatically
   terminate segments initiated during the run unit.


Notes: 
    -crn, -nrn, and -orn are mutually exclusive.
    If neither -exec_com nor -no_exec_com control arguments are given, the
exec_com segment main_program.run.ec is searched for in the same directory as
the main program. If it is not found, the main program is invoked directly.
    When an exec_com is used, the main program name, if any, is passed as the
first argument and the exec_com is responsible for invoking the main program.
