02/15/84  print_heals_message

Syntax:  print_heals_message {-control_args}


Function:  is a tool to be used by administrators for the maintenance
of the HEALS log (the segment named
>system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log).  It allows the printing of all
or selected messages currently in the log.  It can also be used to
delete bad records from the log as well as to print out parts of each
logged record.


Control arguments:
-time DT
   selects all messages that occurred after the specified time.  If
   omitted, a value of 0 is assumed.
-update
   allows you to delete selected messages from the HEALS log if you
   have the appropriate access (see "Notes" below).
-match STR
   selects messages with text containing the match string.


Notes:  The date/time following -time must be of a form acceptable to
convert_date_to_binary_ (see the Subroutines manual).

This command opens the heals_log segment with a mode of
keyed_sequential_update to allow messages to be deleted.  If a message
is selected by using either -time or -match, you can issue the
following requests:
quit,q
   discontinues message processing and returns to command level.


next
   selects the next message that meets the specified selection
   requirements.
delete
   deletes the current record.
data
   prints the octal data contained in the current record.


Access required:  You must have rw access on
>system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log for the update function;
otherwise, r access is sufficient.
