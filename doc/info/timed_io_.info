09/13/82  timed_io_

Function: performs I/O operations which must complete within a
specified time interval.  The user should be familiar with the use of
the subroutine iox_.

Each entry point documented here has an argument denoting the
particular I/O switch involved in the operation, and an argument whose
value is the duration of the period the caller is willing to wait for
the completion of the I/O operation, in microseconds.

:Entry:  get_chars:  09/13/82 timed_io_$get_chars

Function: performs the function of iox_$get_chars; if the operation
does not complete within the specified time interval, the error code
error_table_$timeout is returned to the caller.


Syntax:
declare timed_io_$get_chars entry (ptr, fixed bin (71), ptr, 
     fixed bin (21), fixed bin (21), fixed bin (35));
call timed_io_$get_chars (iocb_ptr, timeout, buff_ptr, n, n_read, code);


Arguments:
iocb_ptr, buff_ptr, n, n_read, and code are as described in the iox_
     documentation.
timeout
     is the period in microseconds during which the caller is willing
     to wait for the completion of the get_chars call.


:Entry:  get_line:  09/13/82 timed_io_$get_line

Function: performs the function of iox_$get_line; if the operation
does not complete within the specified time interval, the error code
error_table_$timeout is returned to the caller.


Syntax:
declare timed_io_$get_line entry (ptr, fixed bin (71), ptr, 
     fixed bin (21), fixed bin (21), fixed bin (35));
call timed_io_$get_line (iocb_ptr, timeout, buff_ptr, buff_len, n_read, code);


Arguments:
iocb_ptr, buff_ptr, buff_len, n_read, and code are as described in the iox_
     documentation.
timeout
     is the period in microseconds during which the caller is willing
     to wait for the completion of the get_line call.


:Entry:  put_chars:  09/13/82 timed_io_$put_chars


Function: performs the function of iox_$put_chars; if the operation
does not complete within the specified time interval, the error code
error_table_$timeout is returned to the caller.


Syntax:
declare timed_io_$put_chars entry (ptr, fixed bin (71), ptr, 
     fixed bin (21), fixed bin (21), fixed bin (35));
call timed_io_$put_chars (iocb_ptr, timeout, buff_ptr, n, n_written, code);


Arguments:
iocb_ptr, buff_ptr, n, and code are as described in the iox_
     documentation.
timeout
     is the period in microseconds during which the caller is willing
     to wait for the completion of the put_chars call.
n_written
     is the number of characters actually written to the switch before
     the timeout period expired.
