02/02/84  suffixed_name_

This subroutine handles storage system entrynames.  It provides an
entry point that creates a properly suffixed name from a user-supplied
name that might or might not include a suffix, an entry point that
changes the suffix on a user-supplied name that might or might not
include the original suffix, and an entry point that finds a segment, a
directory, or a multisegment file whose name matches a user-supplied
name that might or might not include a suffix.  It is intended to be
used by commands that deal with segments with a standard suffix, but
that do not require the user to supply the suffix in the command
arguments.


Entry points in suffixed_name_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  find:  02/02/84 suffixed_name_$find


Function: attempts to find a directory entry whose name matches a
user-supplied name that might or might not include a suffix.  This
directory entry can be a segment, directory, or a multisegment file.


Syntax:
declare suffixed_name_$find entry (char(*), char(*), char(*), char(32),
     fixed bin(2), fixed bin(5), fixed bin(35));
call suffixed_name_$find (directory, name, suffix, entry, type, mode,
     code);


Arguments:
directory
   is the name of the directory in which the entry is to be found.
   (Input)
name
   is the name that has been supplied by the user, and that might or
   might not include a suffix.  (Input)
suffix
   is the suffix that is supposed to be part of name.  It should not
   contain a leading period.  (Input)
entry
   is a version of name that includes a suffix.  It is returned even if
   the directory entry does not exist.  (Output)


type
   is a switch indicating the type of directory entry that was found.
   (Output)
   0   no entry was found.
   1   a segment was found.
   2   a directory was found.
   3   a multisegment file was found.
mode
   is the caller's access mode to the directory entry that was found.
   See the hcs_$append_branch entry point for a description of mode.
   The caller's access mode to the multisegment file directory is
   returned for a multisegment file.  (Output)


code
   is a standard status code.  (Output) It can be one of the following:
   error_table_$noentry
      no directory entry that matches name was found.
   error_table_$no_info
      no directory entry that matches name was found, and furthermore,
      the caller does not have status permission to the directory.
   error_table_$incorrect_access
      a directory entry that matches name was found, but the caller has
      null access to this entry, and to the directory containing this
      entry.
   error_table_$entlong
      the properly suffixed name that was made is longer than 32
      characters.


:Entry:  make:  02/02/84 suffixed_name_$make


Function: makes a properly suffixed name out of a name supplied by the
user that might or might not include a suffix.


Syntax:
declare suffixed_name_$make entry (char(*), char(*), char(32),
     fixed bin(35));
call suffixed_name_$make (name, suffix, proper_name, code);


Arguments:
name
   is the name that has been supplied by the user, and that might or
   might not include a suffix.  (Input)
suffix
   is the suffix that is supposed to be part of name.  It should not
   contain a leading period.  (Input)
proper_name
   is the suffixed version of name.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output) It can be:
   error_table_$entlong
      the properly suffixed name that was made is longer than
      proper_name; proper_name contains only a part of the properly
      suffixed name.


:Entry:  new_suffix:  02/02/84 suffixed_name_$new_suffix


Function: creates a name with a new suffix by changing the (possibly
existing) suffix on a user-supplied name to the new suffix.  If there
is no suffix on the user-supplied name, then the new suffix is merely
appended to the user-supplied name.


Syntax:
declare suffixed_name_$new_suffix entry (char(*), char(*), char(*),
     char(32), fixed bin(35));
call suffixed_name_$new_suffix (name, suffix, new_suffix, new_name,
     code);


Arguments:
name
   is the name that has been supplied by the user, and that might or
   might not include a suffix.  (Input)
suffix
   is the suffix that might or might not already be on name.
new_suffix
   is the new suffix.  (Input)
new_name
   is the name that was created.  If name ends with .suffix, then
   .new_suffix replaces .suffix in new_name.  Otherwise, new_name is
   formed by appending .new_suffix to name.  (Output)


code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)   It can be:
   error_table_$entlong
      meaning that the suffixed new name is longer than new_name and
      therefore new_name contains only part of the suffixed new name.


Notes:  If error_table_$no_s_permission is encountered during the
processing for suffixed_name_$find, it is ignored and is not returned
in the status code.
