Function:	 This is a brief description of the Multics Relational Data Store
(MRDS) which is a generalized database manager based on the relational
approach.


Introduction:  MRDS provides capabilities to create, load, and access a
relational database with a query language that is relationaly complete.

It has an associated end user facility LINUS, Logical Inquiry and Update System
that provides an interface for less computer oriented users.

MRDS provides both a Multics command level interface, and a subroutine level
interface that is callable from all Multics programming languages supporting a
call interface.

The databases supported by MRDS provide a large measure of data independence,
and control of concurrent accesses to the database.  Security and database
recovery are also provided for.  The database concepts of views, and database
snapshots are part of the makeup of MRDS.


References:  There are two Multics manuals that contain the majority of the
information pertinent to MRDS.

The Multics Relational Data Store Reference Manual, Order number AW53, and the
Logical Inquiry and Update System Reference Manual, Order number AZ49.

A good work on databases in general is "An Introduction to Data Base Systems"
by C. J. Date, 2nd edition, Reading, Mass. published by Addison Wesley in 1977.

More specific to relational databases is "Relational Data Base Systems" by Won
Kim, that appeared in ACM Computing Surveys Vol.	11, No.  3, Sept.  1979, pp.
185-211.	An update on this article, involving MRDS, appeared in ACM Computing
Surveys Vol. 12, No. 1, March 1980, pp 111-113.
