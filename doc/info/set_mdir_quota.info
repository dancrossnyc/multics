02/22/85  set_mdir_quota, smdq

Syntax as a command:  smdq path1 change1...{pathN changeN}


Function: sets the quota on a master directory (see the Programmer's
Reference Manual).


Arguments:
pathi
   is the pathname of a master directory whose quota is to be changed.
changei
   is the amount of quota, or the amount of quota change; you can
   specify it as follows:
      +n  add n records of quota to pathi
      -n  subtract n records of quota from pathi
      n  set the quota on pathi to n records


Access required: You must have m permission on the master directory
and must be the owner of the master directory, be a volume
administrator, or have the same quota account as the master directory.


Notes: If the quota is being increased, the master directory's quota
account must have sufficient volume quota to satisfy the request.

The quota of a master directory can never be zero, and it can never be
set less than the current number of records being charged against the
master directory.
