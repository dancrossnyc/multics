07/29/83  menu_create

Syntax:  menu_create menu_name {-control_args}


Function:  creates a menu description, assigns it a specified name, and
stores the description in a segment.  The menu description can be used
with other menu commands, active functions, and subroutines.


Arguments:
menu_name
   is the name assigned to the menu when it is stored.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   creates the segment given by -pathname without querying the user.
-header STR, -he STR
   designates a line of header.  All header lines supplied appear in
   the menu in the order given.  If STR contains blanks or special
   characters, it must be quoted.
-option STR, -opt STR
   specifies a menu option.  The options appear in the menu in the
   order given.  At least one option must be supplied.  If STR contains
   blanks or special characters, it must be quoted.


-pathname PATH, -pn PATH
   is the pathname of the segment in which the menu is stored.  Menus
   are stored in value segments of which the value suffix is assumed.
   If the segment selected does not exist, you are asked if you want to
   create it (unless you have used -brief).  If -pathname is omitted,
   the user's default value segment
   (>udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.value) is used to store the
   menu.
-trailer STR, -tr STR
   specifies a trailer line.  All trailers appear in the menu in the
   order given.  If STR contains blanks or special characters, it must
   be quoted.


List of Additional Control Arguments:  The remaining control arguments
are optional and manipulate the format of the menu.
-center_headers, -ceh
   causes all header lines to be centered.
-center_trailers, -cet
   causes all trailer lines to be centered.
-columns N, -col N
   sets the number of columns in the menu to N, where N is a positive
   decimal integer.  The default is one column.
-line_length N, -ll N
   specifies the line length for the menu, where N is a positive
   decimal integer.  If not supplied, the line length is the user's
   terminal one at the time the command is invoked.
-no_center_headers, -nceh
   causes header lines to be left-flush.  (Default)


-no_center_trailers, -ncet
   causes trailer lines to be left-flush.  (Default)
-option_keys STR, -okeys STR
   indicates the keystrokes to be associated with each option.  Each
   character in STR is associated with the corresponding option, so
   that if it is typed, the corresponding option is selected.  There
   must be at least as many characters in STR as there are options.  If
   this control argument is not given, the string
   "123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" is used.
-pad C
   specifies the padding character for centering, where C is one
   character.  The default is the space character.


Access Required:  The user must have rw access on the value segment.
