12/06/84 before_journal_meters, bjmt

Syntax:  bjmt {paths} {-control_args}


Function:  before_journal_meters gathers and organizes various data
from DM tables that serve to indicate the performance of the before
journal manager.  Information is provided summarizing system-wide
behavior and per-journal behavior.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of before journals.  If the before journal suffix,
   .bj, is not present, it will be added by before_journal_meters.


Control arguments:
-reset, -rs
   suppresses reporting on the meters resets them to zero.
-report_reset, -rr
   reports on the meters and then resets them.
-brief, -bf
   selects the brief format for reporting on before journal usage.
   (DEFAULT)
-long, -lg
   selects the long format for reporting on before journal usage.  This
   includes a detailed breakdown of system-wide usage of each before
   journal manager operation.


Notes:  Some portions of the long report require re access to
dm_admin_gate_.  If the user does not have such access, as much
information as is available without it will be displayed.


Examples:  Following are two example invocations of this command.  The
first is the default output (the -brief format), the second is the long
output.
