02/22/88  set_cc

Syntax as a command:  set_cc fileNN {-control_arg}


Function:  sets the carriage control transformation for a specified
FORTRAN formatted file either on or off.


Arguments:
fileNN
   is the name of a FORTRAN file in the range of file01 to file99.  If
   fileNN is out of range, an error message is printed.


Control arguments:
-off
   turns the carriage control transformation off for the specified
   FORTRAN file.
-on
   turns the carriage control transformation on for the specified
   FORTRAN file.
   The "+" control character is ignored when the file is attached
   to the terminal unless the "-defer" control argument is specified.

-defer
   defers printing of fortran output permitting all carriage control
   transformations even when the file is attached to a terminal.
   (See the description of the "+" control character in the NOTES
   section).


Notes:  When the transformation is on, the first character of each line
written to the file is changed to a control character in accordance
with the following table:

Character   Resulting Control Character
---------   ---------------------------
0           Newline 012 (double space)
1           Newpage 014 (page eject)
blank       None (single space)


+           The previous and current lines are written as a single line
            split by a carriage return character, which causes the
            second line to overprint the first.  This control character
	  is treated like a blank (single space) when the file is
	  attached to the terminal unless the "-defer" control argument
	  was specified.


When the transformation is off, the first character is not changed.
The default is off for all files except for file06 and file42, for
which the default is on.
