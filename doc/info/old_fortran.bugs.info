02/14/79: Known bugs in the installed (>unb>bound_fortran_) old_fortran compiler.
This compiler is the MR6.1/MR7.0 Multics Old Fortran Compiler (old_fortran).

174  optimizer has reference count problems with parameter
      complex arrays
173  statement label symbol table cannot be used by the
      system debuggers
168  the compiler allows array names in certain contexts
      that are prohibited by the language.
157  an incorrect descriptor packed bit is generated for a
      complex function return value if the function name is a
      parameter of the subprogram being compiled and the name
      does not appear in an external statement.
133  Mode statements of the form:
		mode*k h_name ...
      where "h_name" is any name starting with a lower case
      "h", will not compile correctly. This is due to the
      compiler interpreting decimal integer followed by "h"
      as a hollerith constant.


Suggested Improvements:
144  The following improper sequence is not diagnosed:
		do 10 i = 1, 10
		if (...) go to 10
		do 10 j = 1, 10
143  Type conversion of constants is sometimes delayed until
      execution, resulting is less efficient code. For
      example:
		do 100 x = 0, 13.
      If x is a real variable, the constant 0 is converted to
      floating point (0.0) every time the statement is
      executed.
142  Mode statements of the form:
		mode*k
      are emitted by the compiler when using the -convert
      option, although they are not acceptable to the
      compiler without this option.
