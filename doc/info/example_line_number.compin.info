Syntax:  .ifi example_line_number {"reset"}
      OR
         .ifi ex_lineno {"reset"}


Function:
This macro adds reference line numbers to the lines of an example.


Macro action:
1) If "reset" is not given, sets the current value of the example line
   number counter hanging by one indentation level.  However, if bul-
   lets are also being used in the example, the line number is set
   hanging by two indentation levels.
2) If "reset" is given, sets the example line counter back to 1 in
   preparation for the next example.


Notes:
1) See example.compin.info for information on how to establish the
   extra space needed for line numbers and/or bullets.
