Known errors in the current release of forum.

Description

134  phx20946
When the unprocessed transaction is mailed, the headers that Forum adds
show transaction 0 entered at midnight, Jan 1, 1901 GMT.  This is not
pleasing to the eye.  The mail request should be changed in such a way
that it is clear that what is being mailed is intended to be a forum
transaction.  This might be done by doing what the print request does:
replace the date with "*UNPROCESSED*".

133  phx20898 phx20899
The enter request does not handle transactions created with "reply
-mtg" properly.  It tries to chain the new transaction to the specified
transaction in the new meeting.  If that transaction does not exist in
the new meeting, an error emssage is generated,; if it does exist, an
improper chain is created.

132  phx20810
Errors from forum_$check_user are reported regardless of the use of
-inhibit_error in the list active request.

It should suppress no_trans_for_user in this case.

130  phx20627
V1 forum_ entries incorrectly return error_table_$badstar when they
really mean error_table_$nostars.

128  phx20579
The apply request will operate on the current transaction instead of
creating an unprocessed transaction when no transaction specifier is
given, another non-specifier control argument to forum is given, and no
unprocessed transaction exists.

parse_flags.default_to_unproc requires an unprocessed transaction to
exist in order to select it.

127  phx20578
Transactions created with the apply request don't record the entryname
portion of the meeting they are being entered in.
passport.unprocessed_m,eeting_len is not set.

126  phx20585
remove_project tries to turn of participating switches, whcih is silly,
since it only has a project name.  Also, remove_participant will try
and turn off participating switches if the user is not chairman biut
has 'm' permission.  This is OK, but the message that comes out should
be made clear that it is a warning, and that the user's access was
deleted.

124  phx20563
The chairman request uses a 22 character string to hold the chairman
user/project ids.  This is inadequate and can result in truncation.

123  phx20549
The -user control argument to lsu should be incompatible wiht -idl,
-odl, and -ondl, probable -asc and -desc too.

The -project controla rgument should be treated as a filter, not as an
absolute judge of acceptance.

120  phx20314
The sort_by_chain operation does not retain chaining information,
causing incorrect transaaction trailers to be printed.  The routine
should be fixed to use information already gathered by trans_specs
anyway.

92  phx18764
The expunge request creates a copy of the meeting in the process
directory.  If there is insufficient quota in the process directory,
the expunge will fail.

88  phx17955
Notifications are not sent when a user with privileges enabled enters a
transaction in a meeting at a lower access class.

60  phx17354
init_notifications fails if the AS process is running above system_high
as defined in installation_parms.

A fix for this problem is discussed in the TR.

53  phx16749
V2 forum doesn't recognize ".control" as a valid meeting suffix.  This
will be fixed as time permits, however compatibility with V1 forum at
this level is not really planned.

52  phx17169
Other interactive instantiations of a user should be notified when a
transaction is entered into a meeting, even if by the same userid (ie.
when an absentee enters transactions).
