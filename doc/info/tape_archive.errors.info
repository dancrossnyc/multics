Description

6  phx13569
tape_archive needs to have a command_question handler to catch
tape_ansi_'s questions about damaging volume sets when rreleasing
through tape_ansi_ operations.

However, tape_ansi_ should not be asking questions in a cleanup
handler.  It should clean up the volume and continue the release.  So
this is left a limitation in this error list until the new tape_ansi_
happens along.
