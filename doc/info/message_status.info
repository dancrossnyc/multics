09/10/85 message_status, msgst


Syntax as a command: msgst {mbx_specification} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function: [msgst {mbx_specification}]


Function: prints information about mailboxes on which messages are
being accepted.


Arguments:
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox on which messages are to be accepted.  If not
   given, the user's default mailbox (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx)
   is used.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints information for all mailboxes on which the user is accepting
   or deferring messages.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to
      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.


-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.


Notes on use as an active function:
When used as an active function, message_status returns the command
string which may be used to set the message acceptance state on the
specified mailbox to the current state.  Thus multiple acceptance
states may be pushed and popped using the value segment like so:

   value_set old_state ||[msgst] -push
   dm
   value_set old_state ||[msgst] -push
   am -call "ec message_handler"
   [value_get old_state -pop]
   [value_get old_state -pop]
