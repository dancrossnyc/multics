:Entry: release_area_: 02/06/84  release_area_

Function: cleans up an area after it is no longer needed.


Syntax:
declare release_area_ entry (ptr);
call release_area_ (area_ptr);


Arguments:
area_ptr
   points to the area to be released.  (Input/Output)  area_ptr is
   set to null after copying it to a local variable.


Notes: If the area is a segment acquired via the define_area_
subroutine, the segment is released to the free pool via the temporary
segment manager.  If the area was not acquired (only initialized) via
the define_area_ subroutine then the area itself is reinitialized to
the empty state.  In certain cases when the area is defined by the
system or when the area is extended in ring 0, the temporary segment
manager is not used and the area segments are actually created and
deleted.  Segments acquired to extend the area are released to the
free pool of temporary segments or deleted if they are not obtained
from the temporary segment manager.
