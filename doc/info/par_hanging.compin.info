Syntax:  .ifi par_hanging {N}
    OR   .ifi pNh {M}
 where   N may have values 1 through 9
         M is the number of indention levels by which the first line
         is to hang and may also have the values 1 through 9.  If M is
         not given, a value of 1 is used.

Function:
This macro provides an alternate paragraph break as appropriate for the
output device with an undented first line identifier and optionally
sets the indention for the paragraph to the Nth level (See Notes.)


Macro action:
Sets paragraph separation space as defined for the device.
If N is given, sets paragraph indention to the Nth level; otherwise,
the current indention level is not changed.
Sets the first text undented to the Mth prior (N-M) indention level.
Sets the remaining text at the indention level STARTING WITH THE FIRST
LINE.

Notes:  Ten levels of indention are defined in mutiples of a standard
amount for the output device, 4 spaces for typewriters and 2 EMs for
phototypesetters.  Thus, level 0 is flush left for all devices while
level 2 in indented 8 spaces for typewriters and 4 EMs for
phototypsetters.
