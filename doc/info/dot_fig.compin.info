12/14/80  dot_fig.compin

Syntax:  .ifi dot_fig "figure-title"


Function:
This compose macro
1) increments the figure "dot number" counter
2) outputs a centered, perhaps multiline figure caption below the
   figure with appropriate spacing between figure and caption
3) adds the 'figure-title' to the list of Illustrations in the Table of
   Contents if the creation of such a list has been enabled (see
   fig_on.compin.info)


Arguments:
'figure-title' is the title of the figure, as it is to appear in the
   list of Illustrations in the Table of Contents (initial caps, no
   underlines).


Notes:
1) The figure "dot number" counter is maintained on a per-section basis
   for documents done in sections (those in which the 'section'
   variable has been set), and on a per-document basis for all other
   documents.
2) After the dot_fig macro is used, the 'figure' compose variable
   contains the figure number of the current figure.  'figure' will be
   of the form '<section>-<last_fig_no>.N' if the 'section' variable
   has been set.  'figure' can be used in the text to refer to the
   current figure.  (See dot_fig_get_no.compin.info and
   fig_get_no.compin.info for references to a figure other than the
   current figure.)
3) The dot_fig macro cannot be used without an existing <last_fig_no>,
   that is, it must follow some use of the fig or fig_index macros.
   The next use of the fig, fig_index, or fig_get_no macro resets the
   figure "dot number" counter back to zero.
4) See dot_fig_index.compin.info, fig_index.compin.info,
   dot_fig_get_no.compin.info, fig_get_no.compin.info, and
   fig_on.compin.info for related information.


Examples:
To add a Figure after Figure 3-3 of a document...
     .ifi dot_fig "Added Figure"
resulting in...

                      Figure 3-3.1.  Added Figure
