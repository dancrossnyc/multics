02/18/85  path

Syntax as a command:  path path {entry {component}}


Syntax as an active function:  [path path {entry {component}}]


Function: returns the absolute pathname represented by the argument if
you supply one argument; returns the absolute pathname of the archive
component (if you give component) of the entry in the directory
specified by the path argument if you specify two or three arguments.


Arguments:
path
   If you don't give entry, this is the pathname to be expanded and
   returned; otherwise it is the pathname of the directory to be used
   in the returned pathname.
entry
   is the optional entryname to be used in the returned pathname.
component
   is the optional archive component name to be used in the returned
   pathname.


Notes: Since the pathname is returned in quotes, the command processor
treats it as a single argument regardless of special characters in the
name.
