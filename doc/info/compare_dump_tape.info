01/13/87  compare_dump_tape


Syntax as a command:  compare_dump_tape -control_args


Function:  This command compares Multics storage system hierarchy dump
data on two sets of input tape, a master set and a copy set.  Options
allow selective comparinging based upon pathname specifications in a
selection file; and comparing using a storage system file containing an
image of a set of dump tape, rather than tapes.


Control arguments:
-abort
   indicates that comparing of the master with the copy should stop
   when the first discrepancy is found.
-copy_file OUT_PATH, -cf OUT_PATH
   gives the pathname of a copy file to be compared with the master
   data.
-copy_volume VOLNAMES, -cvol VOLNAMES
   gives a list of tape volume names.  The master data is compared with
   this copy tape volume set.  The names are separated from one another
   by a blank.  Up to 20 volume names can be given.  This control
   argument may be followed by the control arguments described below in
   "Control arguments for volume attributes".


-master_file IN_PATH, -mf IN_PATH
   gives the pathname of a file containing an image of the backup dump
   tape.  This file must have been created by a prior invocation of
   compare_dump_tape.  It contains the master data to be copied.
-master_volume VOLNAMES, -mvol VOLNAMES
   gives a list of tape volume names containing the master data to be
   copied.  The names are separated from one another by a blank.  Up to
   20 volume names can be given.  This control argument may be followed
   by the control arguments described below in "Control arguments for
   volume attributes".
-maximize_devices, -maxdv
   indicates that all tape drives reserved by the process or assigned
   to the process are to be used equally (round-robin) when mounting
   tapes.


-no_abort, -nabort
   indicates that comparing master and copy should continue when errors
   are encountered, until 20 discrepancies are found.  This is the
   default.
-no_maximze_devices, -nmaxdv
   allows RCP to select which tape drives to use when reading tapes.
   This is the default.
-no_select, -nslct
   indicates that all master data is to be compared with copy data.
   This is the default.
-no_trace, -ntrace
   prevents tracing information from being printed.  This is the
   default.


-select SELECT_PATH, -slct SELECT_PATH
   gives the pathname of a file similar to a standard backup_dump
   control file.  This file gives paths of master files to be selected
   for comparison.  See "Notes on control file."
-trace {TYPE}
   controls printing of trace information while comparing.  This
   information is primarily used for debugging compare_dump_tape.  See
   "List of trace types".


Control arguments for volume attributes:
   The following control arguments define attributes of tape volumes
   given in preceding -master_volume or -copy_volume control argument.
-density DEN, -den DEN
   gives a tape density.  DEN may be 800, 1600 or 6250.  The input
   tapes are mounted on a tape drive capable of reading density DEN.
   However, the actual density at which the input tapes are written
   determines the density used for reading.  The default density is
   1600 BPI (bits per inch).
-track TK, -tk TK
   mounts tapes on a tape drive capable of handling tapes containing TK
   tracks.  TK may be 7 or 9.  The default track size is 9.


List of trace types:
   One of the following trace types may be given as operand with the
   -trace control argument.  These arguments control the type of trace
   information printed.  If any tracing is enabled, then attach
   descriptions are printed in addition to the segment information
   described below.
compare, cmp
   during the compare operation, trace master segments selected by
   paths in the -select file.  This is the default if -trace is
   specified without a TYPE operand.
off
   turn off tracing.  This is equivalent to -no_trace.
rejects, reject, rej
   print master segments unmatched or rejected by paths in the -select
   file.


List of severity values:
   compare_dump_tape sets an external variable to indicate the success
   or failure of copy and compare operations.  This variable may be
   examined using the severity command/active function.  For example:

      &goto RESULT_&[severity compare_dump_tape]

   The following severity values can be returned.


0
   The compare operation completed successfully.
2
   The compare operation completed successfully, but one or more paths
   given in the -select file were not matched by master segments.
   These pathnames are listed in a message printed by
   compare_dump_tape.
3
   The compare operation found discrepancies between master and copy
   segments.
4
   The compare operation failed, due to fatal errors.  These errors are
   listed in error messages printed by compare_dump_tape.


Notes:  Either -master_file or -master_volume must be given to specify
the source of master input data.  Either -copy_file or -copy_volume
must be given to specify the source of copy input data.


Notes on control file:  The control file specified by -select is an
ASCII segment containing pathnames of entries (segments, MSFs, and
directory subtrees).  Each pathname must be given on a separate line.
Absolute pathnames must be given, with each entryname of the path being
a primary name (the first name of the entry).  Master entries matching
one of the paths are compared.  Master entries which are superior to
one of the paths are also compared.  If a path identifies a directory,
then master entries inferior to that directory are compared.  A
pathname preceded by a circumflex (^) character identifies entries
which are NOT to be compared, unless later entries in the control file
override the rejection.


For example--

   >library_dir_dir>hardcore
  ^>library_dir_dir>hardcore>info
   >library_dir_dir>hardcore>info>hardcore.header

selects all entries in the subtree below >library_dir_dir>hardcore,
except those in the info directory.  However, the hardcore.header entry
in the info directory is selected.
