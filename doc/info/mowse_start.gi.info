11/24/87  Getting Started with Multics Online Work Station Environment

This info segment gives a brief description of how to get started with
the Multics Online Work Station Environment (MOWSE).


Resources you will need to use MOWSE:
o Any IBM PC, PC-XT, PC-AT, PS/2 or compatible with at least 384K of
  RAM.
o Any video adapter will do: Monochrome, CGA, EGA or Hercules.
o A communications card and a telephone line.
o DOS 2.1 or greater.
o An account on a Multics system that has the MOWSE product.
o The MOWSE User's Manual (Order number GB66).


Before you can use MOWSE:
o You must have installed MOWSE on your PC (see Installing MOWSE on
  your PC below.)
o You must have modified CONFIG.SYS to ensure that the PC uses the
  ANSI.SYS (supplied with DOS) or FCONSOLE.DEV (a product of
  Hersey Microcomputing) so that the ANSI X3.64 terminal control
  sequences are supported (see Choosing a screen driver below.)
o You MUST set your Multics terminal type to MOWSE or MOWSE_FANSI
  with the set_tty command (See Getting MOWSE into operation below.)


Installing MOWSE on your PC:
o Refer to load_mowse.info for more detail and further instructions.
o If you have a communications package with a file transfer feature
  supported by Multics, simply download the five files given in
  load_mowse.info.


o If you have a communcations package with NO file transfer feature,
  but WITH a screen logging feature, you can capture the necessary
  BASIC program as follows:
      Activate screen logging on your PC.
    ! help load_mowse
      ...
      ... More help?  ! section load
      load_mowse code (18 lines) More help?  ! rest
      Deactivate screen logging.
  The screen log file on your PC now contains a BASIC program that
  can be used to download the files.  Invoke the BASIC system on the
  screen log file, edit out the extraneous text, and proceed as shown
  in load_mowse.info.


o If you dont have a communcations package, make a hardcopy of
  load_mowse.info and proceed as outlined therein.
o Put the five PC programs into a DOS directory of your choice and
  assure that the path for that directory is in your DOS PATH list
  (see your DOS Users Guide for information on managing your PATH
  list.)


Choosing a screen driver:
  MOWSE uses ANSI X3.64 terminal control sequences for managing the
  screen display on the PC, therefore you MUST have a screen driver
  module specified as a DEVICE in your CONFIG.SYS (see your DOS Users
  Guide for information on managing your CONFIG.SYS file.)  Two
  screen driver modules are supported:

o ANSI.SYS
  This module is supplied with DOS and implements the minimum subset
  of the ANSI control sequences.
o FCONSOLE.DEV
  This module is available at moderate cost from Hersey
  Microcomputing, Inc., and implements a much richer subset of the
  ANSI control sequences; use of this module will result in better
  performance.


Getting MOWSE into operation:
o Read mowse.info to determine what MOWSE options you may need for
  your communications connection (e.g., baud rate, network
  connection, etc.)
o Type 'MOWSE' and press the ENTER key.  The memory resident part of
  MOWSE will then load itself and return to DOS command level.


o Type 'WSTERM' and press the ENTER key. This will connect you to the
  communication facility installed on your PC and result in the usual
  modem, network, or Multics greeting message. At this point, log in
  to Multics as you normally do.
o When you are logged into Multics, type:
    "set_tty -ttp mowse"	if you are using ANSI.SYS
      (You are now using MOWSE in character stream mode and all Multics
       facilties EXCEPT the video system are available to you.)
    "set_tty -ttp mowsef"	if you are using FCONSOLE.DEV
      (You are now using MOWSE in character stream mode and all Multics
       facilties INCLUDING the video system are available to you.)
o If you want to use the video system or any MOWSE background
  application (including bft) you must type:
    attach_mowse {-control_args}
  before doing so (see attach_mowse.info for more information.)
