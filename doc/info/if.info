Syntax:  if EXPR -then LINE1 {-else LINE2}


Syntax as active function:  [if EXPR -then STR1 {-else STR2}]


Function:	 conditionally executes one of two command lines depending on
the value of an active string.  As an active function, returns one of
two character strings to the command processor depending on the value
of an active string.


Arguments:
EXPR
   is the active string which must evaluate to either "true" or
   "false".
LINE1
   is the command line to execute if EXPR evaluates to "true".  If the
   command line contains any command processor characters, it must be
   enclosed in quotes.
STR1
   is returned as the value of the if active function if the EXPR
   evaluates to "true".


LINE2
   is the command line to execute if EXPR evaluates to "false".  If
   omitted and EXPR is "false", no additional command line is executed.
   If the command line contains any command processor characters, it
   must be enclosed in quotes.
STR2
   is returned as the value of the if active function if the EXPR
   evaluates to "false".  If omitted and the EXPR is "false", a null
   string is returned.
