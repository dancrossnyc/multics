Manual.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a mailbox.  The mbx suffix is assumed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All

   the entire ACL is listed.

   only when indicated by a nonstarred pathname.

directory.


Notes on active function:  The active function returns the modes and
access names of matching entries separated by spaces, e.g., "adrosw
A.B.* ao C.D.a".  The -brief control argument is assumed.
