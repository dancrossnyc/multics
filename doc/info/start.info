10/17/84  start, sr

Syntax as a command:  sr {-control_arg}


Function:  is used after you have issued the quit signal to resume
execution of your process from the point of interruption.


Control arguments:
-no_restore, -nr
   does not restore the standard I/O attachments (see "Notes").


Notes:  You can also use start to resume execution after an unclaimed
signal, provided that the condition that caused that signal either is
innocuous or has been corrected.  This command restores the attachments
of the user_input, user_output, and error_output I/O switches and the
mode of user_i/o to their values at the time of the interruption unless
you give -no_restore.

You can issue start at any time after a quit signal as long as you
haven't given a release command.

If there is no suspended computation to restart, the command prints the
message "start ignored."
