02/05/85  pascal_create_area

Syntax as a command:  pascal_create_area names {-control_args}


Function: creates temporary, private areas in the process directory
for the specified Pascal object segments.


Arguments:
names
   are relative pathnames of Pascal object segments that are to have
   their own private areas.  An error occurs for each object segment
   for which a private area has already been created.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the error message that is printed when the private area
   for a specified program already exists.
-long, -lg
   allows the error message that is printed when the private area for a
   specified program already exists.  (Default)
-size N
   sets the maximum size of each area to N pages.  (Default: 225
   records)


Notes: All Pascal "new" operations executed by the object segments use
the associated private areas.

By default, the new operation uses the default Pascal area in the
process directory.  You can examine this area, and any that are
created, using pascal_area_status.

For information on Pascal see the Multics Pascal User's Guide (GB62).
