02/16/84  test_dcw

Syntax:  test_dcw {device} {name} {-control_args}


Function:  constructs and executes arbitrary DCW lists on any device
supported by the I/O interfacer.


Arguments:
device
   is the name of the device to be used.  This can be either a specific
   device name, such as "tape_02" or "puna," or a generic device type,
   such as "printer" or "disk."  If the device name is omitted, "tape"
   is assumed.
name
   is the name of the tape or disk volume to be mounted.  This argument
   is only used if the device is a tape or a disk.  If the tape or disk
   volume name is omitted, "scratch" is assumed.


Control arguments:
-read
   places the device in read-only mode.  This control argument only
   applies if the device is a disk or a tape.
-7track, -7tr
   specifies a 7-track tape drive.  It only applies if the device is a
   tape.


-priv
   specifies a privileged attachment (see "Notes" below).
-sys
   sets the system_flag in the rcp_ info structure during attachment
   (see "Notes").
-debug, -db
   runs the program in debug mode.  In this mode, only the editing
   requests are recognized; no execution is allowed, and no actual
   device attachment takes place.


Notes: The test_dcw command attaches the device selected using the
rcp_ subroutine.  Normally, the call is made to rcp_$attach as a
nonsystem process.  However, if -priv is used, the call is made to
rcp_priv_$attach.  In both cases, if -sys is used, the system_flag in
the rcp_ info structure is set, to indicate to rcp_ that you are to be
considered a system process.  You must have re access to the rcp_sys_
gate to make this kind of attachment.  If the device specified in the
command line is a device type rather than a specific device, rcp_ is
relied upon to select the actual device to be used.  In either case,
the name of the device actually attached is printed after attachment
completes.


After the test_dcw command is invoked, the following commands are read
from the user_input I/O switch: tdcw, idcw, nidcw, iotp, iotd, iontp,
odcw, pcw, opcw, edit (e), update (u), insert (i), delete (dl, d),
print (p), name, save, restore, execute (x), getstat (g), block (b),
xs, xr, xre, status (st), rs, dump patch, pattern, survey, dtstat,
chan, time, prompt, susp, rel, ? (question mark), . (period), and
quit, (q).  For details about these commands, see the Multics System
Diagnostic Aids (AR97).
