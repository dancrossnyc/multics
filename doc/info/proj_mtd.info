02/09/84  proj_mtd

Syntax:  proj_mtd Project_id


Function: allows the accounting administrator to type a month-to-date
report for any project's usage.  The report lists all users on the
project and their dollar totals, as well as disk and miscellaneous
charges.  This command does not accept additional arguments as the
project administrator's proj_usage_report command does.  It prints a
more complete summary of the project's usage charges because the
accounting administrator has access to more accounting data than the
project administrator does.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project whose usage report is to be
   printed.
