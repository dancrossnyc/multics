02/22/85  shortest_path

Syntax as a command:  shortest_path path {entry {component}}


Syntax as an active function:  [shortest_path path {entry {component}}]


Function: returns the shortest absolute pathname represented by the
argument if you give one argument, or the shortest absolute pathname of
the archive component or the entry in the directory specified by path
if you give two or three arguments.  The shortest name is determined by
using the shortest of each of the names on each component in the path.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname to be expanded and returned if you don't use entry;
   otherwise this is the pathname of the directory to be used in the
   returned pathname.
entry
   is the entryname to be used in the returned pathname.
component
   is the archive component name to be used in the returned pathname.


Notes: Since the pathname returned by path is in quotes, the command
processor treats it as a single argument regardless of special
characters in the name.

When more than one name qualifies as the shortest name for a directory,
shorthest_path tries to select the name containing all lowercase
characters.  If several names still qualify, they are compared to the
primary name of the directory: the first name found with the same
first character as the primary name is chosen; this comparison is case
independent.
