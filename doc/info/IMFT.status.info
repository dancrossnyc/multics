If an error occurs reading the acknowledgement of a "pull" request,
the request is deferred, and therefore resubmitted later.  Meanwhile,
the foreign site has actrually succeeded in queueing the request, so
the file ultimately gets transferred twice.

0021  phx15250
 If a pull request is successfully queued, but then the output driver
 on the source site finds an access problem, the user is not notified
 on the target (i.e.  originating) system.  Fixing this probably means
 always sending a message to the target site whenever a request is
 rejected by the driver, no matter where the request originated.

0016  phx15007
 When the input driver terminates reception of an object at the
 operator's request (ie:  QUIT/release), it should inform the remote
 system's output driver.  Otherwise, the remote system will continue
 to transmit the object; the input driver, however, will ignore all
 data and control records until the BOF record that indicates the
 start of the next object.  As a result, the output driver will
 believe that the object was successfully transmitted when, in fact,
 it was thrown into the bit-bucket.
