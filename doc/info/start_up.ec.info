03/15/74  start_up.ec

 A user can specify that a set of commands be executed when a process is
initialized, i.e. after a login, new_proc, or process termination.
The commands are specified as an exec_com segment in the user's initial working
directory with the name start_up.ec. If the segment start_up.ec exists in the
user's initial working directory, the printing of the message of the day
is suppressed and exec_com is called to execute the commands specified in the
segment. The call to exec_com is issued as the first command to the new process
before any lines are read from the terminal. The call to exec_com is issued
as the command:
    exec_com start_up CREATION_TYPE PROCESS_TYPE


Arguments:
    CREATION_TYPE is the string "login" if the process has been created as the
result of a login and is the string "new_proc" if the process has been created
as the result of a new_proc command or process termination.
    PROCESS_TYPE is the string "interactive" if the process being initialized is
an interactive one, and is the string "absentee" if the process is an absentee
process.
  To print the message-of-the-day, the command "help motd" can be issued from
the exec_com.
