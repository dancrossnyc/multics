Syntax:  ec >t>cpp path1 path2


Function: The compare_pl1 exec_com compares two PL/I programs of
dissimilar formats.


Arguments:
path1, path2
   are the relative or absolute pathnames of the source programs to be
   compared.  The .pl1 suffix is assumed.  The star convention is not
   allowed; the equal convention is allowed for path2.  Archive
   component pathnames are allowed.


Notes: All format_pl1 control comments are removed from both programs.
Then, format_pl1 is used to put both programs into a canonical style.
The compare_ascii command is used to see how the source programs
differ.  Vertical white space inserted or deleted between statements is
not ignored.  The line numbers in the compare_ascii output is not
accurate due to possible white space or statements broken over lines.
