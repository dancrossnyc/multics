07/18/86  memo

Syntax as a command:  memo {-memo_options} memo_text
              or:  memo {-action_args} {-memo_options} {-selection_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [memo memo_text]
                          or:  [memo -list {-totals}]


Function: maintains a user-created reminder list in a memo segment,
which is normally Person_ID.memo, in your home directory.


Arguments:
memo_text
   is the text of the memo being set.  It cannot be longer than 132
   characters.  You can specify it in one of two forms:
   STR
      is the string without an initial hyphen that begins the memo
      text.  No further arguments are accepted.
   -memo STRs
      treats all succeeding STRs as part of the memo text, whether or
      not they begin with hyphens.


List of memo_options: Use these control arguments to control various
   options of the memo being set or to select memos being otherwise
   processed.
-alarm, -al
   specifies that the memo is to be an alarm.  An alarm memo is
   printed, or executed if set with -call, when its timer goes off, if
   timers are enabled, rather than being explicitly processed.  It is
   deleted immediately after it reaches maturity, unless you supplied
   -retain.
-call
   passes the memo text to the command processor as a command line when
   the memo matures, rather than printing it.
-date DT, -dt DT
   identifies a date for the memo to mature.  DT is truncated to the
   midnight preceding the date in which DT falls.  (See "Notes" below.)


-expires DT, -exp DT
   identifies the memo's expiring time; this is treated as a delta from
   the maturity time (which it must be greater than) so that repeating
   memos with expiration times work properly.  When used as a selection
   argument, all expiring memos are selected, regardless of the
   expiration dates.  (See "Notes" and "Notes on expiring memos"
   below.)
-invisible, -iv
   specifies that the memo never be mature and never be printed during
   a normal memo print.
-no_retain, -nret
   processes the memo only once and then deletes it.  (Default for
   alarm memos)


-repeat DT, -rpt DT
   identifies the memo's repeat interval, where DT must be greater than
   or equal to one minute.  When the memo is reset, the new maturity
   time will be the next successive interval that matures in the
   future.  When used as a selection argument, all repeating memos are
   selected, regardless of the repeat intervals given.  (See "Notes"
   and "Notes on repeating memos.")
-repeat_when_processed, -rwp
   specifies that the repeat time of a repeating memo be applied from
   the time the memo is processed, rather than from the maturity time.


-retain, -ret
   keeps an alarm memo as an ordinary printing (or executing if set
   with -call) memo after it matures, rather than being deleted.
   (Default for nonalarm memos)
-time DT, -tm DT
   identifies a time for the memo to mature (see "Notes").


List of action_args: These control arguments control various memo
   options.  The -delete, -list, -postpone, -print, and -process
   actions are mutually exclusive.
-brief, -bf
   does not print message "No memos."  if no memos are found.
-delete {-force}, -dl {-fc}
   deletes all memos selected by the optional arguments.  You must
   explicitly supply at least one memo.  It queries you before deleting
   nonmature memos; however, with -force, it deletes memos--without
   querying you--even if they are not yet mature.


-list, -ls
   prints text and control information of selected memos; no memos are
   executed.  If you don't explicitly select memos, all memos are
   listed.  If you also give -totals, only the total number of selected
   memos is printed.
-off
   suppresses all memo alarms until the next memo command with no
   explicitly specified action.  You can combine -on and -off with
   other actions.
-on
   enables memo alarms without printing or executing nonalarm memos.
-pathname -default, -pn -dft
   resets the default memo segment to Person.ID.memo in your home
   directory.


-pathname path, -pn path
   changes the default memo segment to path if specified with no other
   action; otherwise the memo segment specified by path is used for the
   execution only of the current memo command.  If you supply -pathname
   along with -on or -off, the default memo segment is changed and
   alarms are turned on or off, as appropriate, for the new segment.
   You need not give the suffix .memo.
-postpone DT, -pp DT
   reschedules the maturity of the selected memos to the time specified
   by DT, if DT is later than the current maturity time.  You must
   explicitly provide at least one memo.  (See "Notes.")
-print, -pr
   prints text of all selected memos.  No memos are executed.  If you
   don't explicitly select memos, only mature memos are printed.


-process
   causes all mature memos to be processed, and alarms to be turned on,
   if not otherwise specified.  This is equivalent to explicitly
   specifying no action.
-status, -st
   prints information about the current default memo segment.  If you
   specify it, it must be the only argument.
-totals, -tt
   you can only use it together with -list.  When you give it, the
   total number of memos selected is printed, rather than listing each
   of the memos.


List of selection_args: These arguments are used to select memos to be
   listed, printed, deleated, or postponed.  You can also use some
   memo_options to specify types of memos to be selected (see "Notes").
   When you supply more than one selection_args, only those memos that
   match all the selection criteria are chosen.
memo_number
   is either a positive decimal number specifying a single memo (e.g.,
   32) or two such numbers separated by a colon, specifying a range of
   memos (e.g., 12:16).
-from DT, -fm DT
   selects all memos that mature on, or after, DT.  You can combine it
   with -to, but specify each only once.  It is incompatible with -date
   and -time.  (See "Notes.")


-match STR
   specifies a string against which memo texts are matched to select
   memos.  STR cannot be longer than 32 characters.  You can supply up
   to 40 STRs; all memos that match at least one are selected.
-to DT
   selects all memos that mature on, or before, DT.  This control
   argument is incompatible with -date and -time.  (See "Notes.")


Notes: See time_strings.gi.

No more than 5082 memos can be contained in a single memo segment.  An
individual memo can be no more than 132 characters long.

If you explicitly specify no action and set no memo, all mature memos
are processed (printed or executed) and the alarm timer is turned on,
enabling the processing of alarm memos.

You can use the memo_options to specify types of memos to be selected;
those that take a date/time interval (-repeat, -expires, but not -date
or -time) cause the selection of all repeating or expiring memos, as
the time interval (which you must specify) is ignored.


Notes on default memo segment: The memo command operates on the
default memo segment (unless -pathname is specified with one of the
actions -delete, -list, -postpone, -print or -process).  This default
memo segment is also used when processing alarm timers, to find the
memos which should be processed for the alarm.  If the default memo
segment has never been explicitly specified (by using -pathname without
any other actions), it is the segment Person_ID.memo in the user's home
directory.

The default memo segment is created if it does not already exist.  If
the default memo segment is changed, alarms are turned off for the old
memo segment, and then turned on for the new one (if requested).  Thus,
only one memo segment can have alarms active at a time.


Notes on repeating memos: A repeating memo repeats by setting a new
memo that is identical to the original one, and then turning off the
repeat specification in the original memo.  Thus the actual repeating
memo, rather than its visible consequences, gets a new number each time
it repeats.  Since the repeat specification is turned off in the
original memo, it never repeats again, but remains until deleted,
unless it has an expiration date or was set with -no_retain.

An alarm memo that repeats will mature once, and then be automatically
deleted, unless it was set with -retain, in which case it is turned
into an ordinary, non-alarm memo and lasts until it expires or is
deleted.


Notes on expiring memos: Expired memos are deleted without being
reprinted or executed.  However, if they are repeating memos, they are
repeated before being deleted.  This is useful for cases such as a
reminder of a weekly meeting, where the reminder of this week's meeting
should always be set, but the reminder of this week's meeting should
not be printed if the current time is after the end of this week's
meeting.  A sequence of repeating memos must be terminated manually (by
deleting the current memo); the -expires control argument is not useful
for this purpose.


Notes on active function: The memo active function can only be used to
set and list memos.  When a memo is set, the number assigned to the
newly set memo is returned.  When memos are listed, a string consisting
of the memo numbers selected, separated by spaces, is returned; if
-totals is specified, the total count is returned.
