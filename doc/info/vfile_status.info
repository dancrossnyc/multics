10/17/84  vfile_status, vfs

Syntax as a command:  vfs path


Function: prints information about and the apparent type
(unstructured, sequential, blocked, or indexed) and length of files.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment or multisegment file.  If the entryname
   portion of a pathname denotes a directory, it is ignored.  If no
   files are found for the given pathname, a message is printed.  If
   the entry is a link, the information returned pertains to the entry
   to which the link points.  The star convention is allowed.


Notes: For structured files, information about the state of the file
(if busy) and the file version (unless current) is printed.  For
blocked files the maximum record length is printed.  For indexed files
the following statistics are printed:
   1. the number of records in the file, including zero-length records
   2. the number of nonnull records in the file, if different from the
      above
   3. the total length of the records (bytes)
   4. the number of blocks in the free-space list for records
   5. the height of the index tree (equal to zero for empty files)
   6. the number of nodes (each 1K words, page aligned) in the index
      tree


   7. the total length of all keys (bytes)
   8. the number of keys (if different from record count)
   9. the number of duplicate keys (if nonzero)
  10. the total length of duplicate keys (if any).

For additional information see the status command.
