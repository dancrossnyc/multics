Description

33  phx20249
The program vfile_status sometimes fails because of stack garbage when
called without any arguments.  The program should be changed to use
cu_$arg_ptr instead of using "proc (pathname)".

32  phx07989 phx14617 phx20725
vfile_ doesn't support a type 3 position thru iox_$position.  See the
text of the TR for complete details.

31  phx08871
When a shared indexed sequential vfile changes from an SSF to an MSF,
one or more of the "shared" openings can become confused (their FCBs no
longer accurately represent the vfile, and they have pointers at a
now-deleted segment, the SSF version).

29  phx17445
Writing a record to a sequential file will loop infinitely creating MSF
empty components if the size of the record is in the right range. The
max_record_size is too large.

28  phx16307
When using vfile_ through io_call, some combinations of select/exclude
and -delete_old_subsets are mishandled.

27  phx16055
open_uns_file, in setting beyond_limits, is getting the wrong value
because of an incorrect interaction with pl1 precision rules. Instead
of 2**34, 2.00000000**34 should be used to force the use of extended
precision by the compiler.

26  phx15327
sequential and keyed sequential access methods don't support position
type 2 (absolute positioning).

25  phx15906
On attaching, vfile should reject attachments to files with a max seg
length of 0.

21  phx12676
sequential file attachments with -extend don't honor the file lock set
by another pre-existing write opening.

20  phx12337
If a rewrite_record is done before any positioning operation which uses
the index, in an indexed sequential vfile, it gets a null_ptr fault
trying to reference the current node of the index because pos_ptr is
null. (The positioning must have been done via

19  phx12312
record_stream_$read_record converts errors from iox_$get_line to 0.
This is a particular problem when calling tape_mult_, which doesn't
support get_line.

6  phx07971
short_record is returned for unstructured files when a line spans
segments and the user's buffer is too small to hold the line.

3  phx08855
vfile_status_ doesn't destroy its temporary iocbs.

2  phx08212
when an attachment to a non-existent file is made using the -old
control argument, no error is detected until open time. It should
return an error at attach time.
