Syntax:  cv_pmf pmf_path {-control_args}


Function:  converts an ASCII project master file (PMF) into a binary
project definition table (PDT).


Arguments:
pmf_path
   is the pathname of the PMF.  If path does not have a suffix of pmf,
   one is assumed; however, the suffix pmf must be the last component
   of the name of the source.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints error messages in the short format.
-long, -lg
   prints error messages in the long format.
-severity N, -sv N
   causes error messages whose severity is less than N (where N is 0,
   1, 2, 3, or 4) not to be written to the user_output switch.  If not
   specified, a severity level of 0 is assumed; i.e., all error
   messages are written to the user_output switch.


Notes:  The PMF is described in Section 3 of the MAM -- Project
Adminstrator Manual, Order No.  AK51, "Project Master File."  The newly
converted PDT is placed in the current working directory.  The
entryname of the new PDT is the same as the entryname of its source
PMF, with the pmf suffix replaced by pdt.  This command associates the
following severity values to be used by the severity active function:

   Value     Meaning

      0      No compilation yet or no error.
      1      Warning.
      2      Correctable error.
      3      Fatal error.
      4      Unrecoverable error.
      5      Could not find source.
