Description

15  phx09049
the message "exp(x), x > 88.028, not allowed" is not very helpful in
cases where the exp function was used implicitly

14  phx16162
The code in find_condition_info_ depends on the value of an
uninitialized flag.  This can cause a fault_tag_1 when the stack frame
pointer is null and there is no condition frame.

13  phx15846
com_err_ should be able to print messages longer than 256 characters.

9  phx05920
There are too many quotation marks around the word start in the error
message for square root of a negative number.  Also, sqrt should be
changed to square route in the message.

8  phx11622
Default error handlers takes faults if the current working directory is
deleted.  THis is nondelux.

7  phx03742
The error message involving sqrt of a negative number prints the wrong
line number.  This was on the old deh bug list, but do we really believe
that it is not a problem is stu_?  This is left here only for
completeness.

6  phx06942
There are NL's missing before and after linkage_error messages.  Perhaps
linkage_error_ is to blame?

4  phx05898
The messages for arithmetical errors often contain references to PL/I
builtins.  They should use generic terms, or mention fortran as well.
Better yet, the error handlers should be able to tell which flavor of
program took the error, but for that see the following suggestion,.

3  phx05641
The char printed for onchar=, at least when there is no message for the
oncode, is incorrect.  It is one character to the left.

2  phx05641
The message printed for a missing oncode message is mispelled.

1  phx05641
Oncode messages for oncode 376 is missing.  oncode_messages_ has to be
fixed.
