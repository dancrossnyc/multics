07/26/82 command_usage_count, cuc

Syntax:  cuc operation {command_names} {-control_args}


Function:  provides a record of the number of times commands are used
and the User_ids for each invocation of them.  The commands to be
metered in this way must be listed in a segment named
command_usage_list_.  Usage totals are stored in a segment named
command_usage_totals_.  This command actually performs three
operations:  it prints and clears the meters, adds commands to
command_usage_list_, and deletes commands from command_usage_list_.


List of operations:
add
   adds commands to the list (command_usage_list_) of commands to be
   metered.  Commands added to the list in a single invocation of
   the "cuc add" command form a command "group", which can be
   manipulated as a whole.
delete, dl
   deletes command groups (see above) from the list of commands to
   be metered.
print, pr
   prints (and clears) the metered data (subject to any restrictions
   the specified control_args impose).


Arguments:
command_names
   are long or short names of commands.  If given with either the print
   or delete operation, only one command name from each group to be
   printed or deleted need be given, and all the commands in each group
   so represented are acted upon.  If no names are given with the print
   or delete operation, all command groups are printed/deleted.
   Command names (long and/or short) must be given with the add
   operation, and all the names added in a single invocation are added
   as a single group to the list.  Short names of commands can only be
   used with the print and delete operations if they were specified
   with the add operation.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   prints meters for all the command groups, or deletes all command
   groups from the list.  This is the default for the print and delete
   operations if no command_names are given.  This control_arg cannot
   be used with the add operation.
-brief, -bf
   omits column headings from the printout (can only be used with the
   print operation).  The default is to print column headings.
-clear, -cl
   clears the usage counters and user list when meters are printed (can
   only be used with the print operation).  It clears the user list
   even if the -total control_arg is also specified.


-first N, -ft N
   prints only the N greatest users of the specified commands (can only
   be used with the print operation).  This control_arg cannot be used
   in conjunction with the -total control_arg.
-total, -tt
   prints only the total use of the commands in the specified command
   groups, when used with the print operation.  When used with the add
   operation, meters only the total usage of commands specified.  The
   default with both of these operations is to print/meter the users of
   the commands as well as total usage.  See "Notes" below.  This
   control_arg cannot be used with the delete operation.


Access required:  In order to add and delete commands, and to clear
meters, the user must have rw access to the command_usage_list_
segment.  Otherwise, all users should have r access to
command_usage_list_, and rw access to command_usage_totals_.  Both
segments are found using object search rules and most commonly are in
>sss (system_library_standard directory).  If they are not in >sss, a
link in >sss points to them.


Notes:  For each group of commands added without the -total control
argument, this command creates a segment named command_name.usage in
>sss (or, if a link is there, wherever the link points).  The user must
put the link in >sss before the first usage of cuc add, since the
metering program creates the command_name.usage segment in the same
directory in which it finds command_usage_list_.  The
command_name.usage segment contains the list of User_ids for those
using the commands in the group.  User_ids are printed in the order of
greatest usage.  When the -first control argument is given, in addition
to printing the user count and name for the N greatest users, this
command prints an additional line giving the user count for "all
others."


At sites using the access isolation mechanism (AIM), only the usage of
system_low users is recorded.


Examples:  In the following example, assume that no commands are listed
in the command_usage_list_ segment.  The user adds two commands (in two
separate command groups) by typing:
     command_usage_count add set_search_rules ssr
     cuc add enter_abs_request ear -total
The next time a process is created, those commands can be metered by
typing:
     cuc print


The following lines are then displayed:
     USAGE COMMAND USER USER
     COUNT GROUP COUNT NAME
         3     set_search_rules
               ssr
                             2    Baker.Multics
                             1    Green.SysMaint
         1 enter_abs_request
               ear

Note that user count and user name are not provided for the command
group added with the -total control_arg.


To delete these commands from the list, the user types:
     cuc delete -all

or the equivalent:
     cuc dl
