05/16/88  value_get, vg

Syntax as a command:  vg name {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [vg name {-control_args}]


Function: returns the character string value of a name, as set by
value_set.  If the name has no value and you choose -default, an error
occurs.  Values, except for per-process values, are stored in a value
segment with suffix "value" (see "Notes on value segment").


Arguments:
name
   is a character string.  It can be -name STR to specify a name
   beginning with a minus sign, to distinguish it from a control
   argument.


Control arguments:
-call STR
   if no value is found for name, the active function [STR] is expanded
   to produce a value, which is both set for name and returned.
   Enclose STR in quotes and omit the brackets if it contains special
   characters such as spaces.  This control argument is incompatible
   with -default.
-data
   specifies that the value of the name is actually an uninterpreted
   data region, normally accessable by using the value_$set_data and
   value_$get_data subroutine interface.  The contents of the region
   will be returned in an uninterpreted form.  See "Notes on data-type
   values".


-default STR, -df STR
   specifies a default value to be returned if none is set.  Enclose
   STR in quotes if it contains special characters.  A null string is
   returned if STR is "".  If you don't give -default and no value
   exists, an error occurs.
-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies a value segment other than the current default one,
   without changing the default (see "Notes on value segment").  It is
   incompatible with -perprocess.


-permanent, -perm
   does not look for a per-process value.  The default is to return the
   per-process value if one exists, otherwise to return the value
   stored in the value segment; if none exists, an error occurs.
-perprocess, -pp
   looks only for a per-process value, not for one stored in any value
   segment.  If a per-process value is not found, an error occurs.
-pop
   deletes the current value that it prints or returns.  If a previous
   value was saved by value_set -push, that value is reinstated.


Access required: You require read access on the value segment, except
for per-process values.


Notes: Per-process values are stored in a temporary value segment in
the process directory and disappear when the process terminates.

By default, both "vg name" and "vg name -pn path" return the
per-process value of name if there is one; otherwise, they return the
value stored in the appropriate value segment.  By contrast, "vg -pp"
returns only the per-process value, and "vg -perm" returns only the one
in the value segment.

See value_defined, value_delete, value_list, value_path, value_set, and
value_set_path.


Notes on data-type values:  The contents of data-type values are
normally used to hold data structure information, which contain
non-ascii (binary) information.  If the -data argument is used,
the value of the named data-type element will be returned with no
conversion performed.  It is suggested that the output be routed
into a temporary segment by using the file_output command or
the I/O redirection facility of the command processor (;|).

The -data control argument is incompatible with the -call, -default,
pop or -perprocess control arguments.


Notes on value segment: The value segment searched is either the one
specified by -pathname or the current default value segment.  The
default segment is initially
   [home_dir]>[user name].value
but you can change it by value_set_path.  Use of -pathname does not
change the default segment.
