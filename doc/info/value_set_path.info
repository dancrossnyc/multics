10/17/84  value_set_path, vsp

Syntax as a command:  vsp {path} {-control_arg}


Function: sets the default value segment used by the value commands
without -pathname.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a value segment or a nonexistent segment, which
   is created.  The value suffix is assumed.  If you don't give path or
   is equal to the null string (""), it is restored to your default
   value segment.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning printed when you lack write access to the
   value segment.


Access required: You need at least r access to the value segment, and
rw is preferred.  If you lack r access, the default path is not changed
and an error message is printed; if you lack rw, the default path is
changed, but a warning is printed.  You can use -brief to suppress this
warning.


Notes:  The default value segment in a process is initially
   [home_dir]>[user name].value
See value_defined, value_delete, value_get, value_list, value_path, and
value_set.
