02/11/85  delete_acl, da

Syntax as a command:  da path {User_ids} {-control_args}


Function: removes entries from the access control lists (ACLs) of
nonlink entries in a directory (see ACL.gi).


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of an entry.  If it is -working_directory (-wd),
   your working directory is assumed.  The star convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   ACL entries with matching names are deleted.  If you give no
   User_ids, your Person_id and current Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   deletes all ACL entries except for *.SysDaemon.*.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the messages "User name not on ACL" and "Empty ACL."
-chase
   chases links when using the star convention.  Links are always
   chased when path is not a star name.
-directory, -dr
   affects only directories.  (Default: segments, multisegment files,
   and directories)
-no_chase
   does not chase links when using the star convention.  (Default)


-segment, -sm
   affects only segments and multisegment files.
-select_entry_type STR, -slet STR
   affects only entries of the entry type selected by STR, which is a
   comma-delimited list of file system entry types.  Use the
   list_entry_types command to obtain a list of valid entry type
   values.  Example: da ** -slet mbx,segment.


Access required: You need modify permission on the containing
directory.
