02/20/85  reset_ips_mask

Syntax as a command:  reset_ips_mask {signal_names} {-control_args}


Function: sets the IPS mask for the current process to unmask some or
all IPS signals.


Arguments:
signal_names
   are the names of one or more IPS signals to be unmasked.  The signal
   names must be defined in sys_info$ips_mask_data.  Presently the
   defined signal names are quit, alrm, neti, cput, trm_, sus_, wkp_,
   pgt_, system_shutdown_scheduled_, and dm_shutdown_scheduled_.
   Supply either signal_names or -all.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   sets the IPS mask to unmask all IPS signals.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of the previous state of the IPS mask after
   setting it.
-long, -lg
   prints the previous state of the IPS mask after setting it.
   (Default)


Notes: If all undefined IPS signals are either masked or unmasked and
you give -long, they are not mentioned; if, however, some are masked
and others are not, an octal list is printed.  This can only happen
when you specify an invalid (probably uninitialized) value in a call to
set that mask.
