03/06/80  apl_read_segment_ external function

Function: reads a segment into an apl character value.


Usage:
   )MFN READ_SEGMENT APL_READ_SEGMENT_
   RESULT -< READ_SEGMENT 'PATH'


Arguments:
PATH
   is the pathname of the segment to be read. It can be relative or
   absolute. The bitcount must be set.

RESULT
   is the character value that is returned by the function.


Notes:
The segment is read in as a character vector, containing as many elements as
there are bytes in the segment. Thus, lines are separated by new line
characters (octal 012), not the usual apl matrix convention. The qCS system
variable may be subscripted to obtain a new line character in a program.

While the most useful form is probably to read in text segments, no restriction
is placed on the type of data that may be read; any segment is ok.

This is the most efficient method for reading data from segments into apl.
