01/04/85  reverse_substr, rvsubstr

Syntax as a command:  rvsubstr STR I {N}


Syntax as an active function:  [rvsubstr STR I {N}]


Function:  performs the same function as the substr command/active
function, but counts characters from right to left.  The returned
string has its characters in the same order as the input string.


Notes:  The active function returns that portion of STR starting with
the character in position I (the characters in the string being numbered
from right to left starting with one) and continuing for N characters
(where I and N are decimal integers; I must be greater than zero and N
must be greater than or equal to zero).  If N is omitted, the remained
of STR is returned.  If I is greater than the length of STR, the null
string is returned.  If N is greater than the remainder of STR, the
remainder is returned.

   [reverse_substr STR I {N}]
is the same as--
   [reverse [substr [reverse STR] I {N}]]


Examples:
(! marks user input)

 ! reverse_substr abcdefg 2 3
   def
 ! reverse_substr frobozz 4
   frob
 ! reverse_substr spatula 5 4
   spa
