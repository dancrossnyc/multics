08/02/84  gcos_build_library, gcbl

Syntax as a command:  gcbl input_path output_path {-control_args}


Function:
     This command builds a GCOS simulator software library from a
native GCOS system-loadable file and optionally appends a second
software file.  A catalog (or load table) is built from information on
the input file and the optional append file, and occupies the first
1000 words of the output file.  This process is analogous to building
the "GECALL TABLE" by GCOS, at startup, and exists for the same reason
(i.e., to facilitate loading of the individual modules).


Arguments:
input_path
   is the pathname of the input file.  This file may or may not already
   have a catalog.  This file may have been created by this procedure,
   in which case it has a catalog, or by the gcos_extract_module or
   gcos_pull_tape, in which case it would not have a catalog.
output_path
   is the pathname of the file into which the modules in the input file
   (plus those in the optional append file) are to be copied, preceded
   by a catalog.  If this file already exists, it is overwritten, with
   no warning.


Control arguments:
-append append_path
   -append append_path append_path is the pathname of a file whose
   contents are to be appended to those of the input file (i.e., copied
   to the end of the output file) before the new catalog is built.
-brief, bf
   suppresses printing of the catalog (load name and offset) of
   output_path.


Notes:  The catalog occupies the first 1000 words of the output file,
and has space for 499 entries.

Existing modules are not replaced by the appending function.  The only
way to replace an existing module with a different version of itself is
to extract from the existing library, into a new file, all the modules
except the one(s) to be replaced, extract the new versions of those
modules into the new file (they are appended to those previously
extracted into the file), and then build a catalog for the new file.

This command cannot be used to manipulate a random system-loadable file
since the catalog created differs from the format of the catalog
produced by SYSEDIT (commonly used for ** files).


This command is not used to convert the GCOS subroutine libraries (the
SOFTW-SYSLIB files) to a form usable by the GCOS simulator.  To do
this, the gcos_reformat_syslib command is used.
