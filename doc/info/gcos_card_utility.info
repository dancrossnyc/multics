Syntax as a command:  gcu {-input} INPUT {-input control args}
   {-output} OUTPUT {-output control args}


Function:
Copies GCOS Standard System Format files or tapes, altering their
format, content, and medium, as specified.  Converts between GCOS
Standard System Format files, tape, or card images and Multics ASCII
text files or other GCOS files.


Arguments:
INPUT
OUTPUT
   specify the files to read and write.  These files are either
   segments or on tape.  Files are specified either by a single
   pathname, -tape or -attached, or -list.  Pathnames may have the
   suffixes ".ascii", ".gcos", ".raw", or ".comdk" to indicate their
   format.


List of input control arguments:
-input, -in
   specifies the beginning of the input part of the command.  Not
   necessary if the input is a single pathname.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of nonfatal error messages.
-long, -lg
   prints names of snumbs, edit names, tape file names, and Multics
   pathnames as they are read from input.  Prints all input item names
   and indicates those selected for copying.


List of input control arguments (to specify format):
-ascii, -aci
   specifies Multics ASCII text format.  May be omitted if the
   pathname has the suffix ".ascii".  This is the default format for
   non-tape files.
-gcos, -gc
   indicates file is in GCOS Standard System Format.  The media code
   of the data is determined for each record read.  May be omitted of
   the pathname has the suffix ".gcos" or if the input is tape which
   must be gcos format.
-raw
   indicates file contains card images, in the format accepted by the
   Multics I/O daemon, for card input in raw mode.  May be omitted if
   the pathname has the suffix ".raw".


-comdk, -cdk
   will decompresses any COMDKs present.  May be omitted if pathname
   has the suffix ".comdk".


List of input control arguments (to specify tabs and truncation):
-canonicalize, -can
   perform canonicalization.
-no_canonicalize, -ncan
   do not perform canonicalization.
-tabs TABSTOPS
   supplies logical tab stops to be used for canonicalization.
   TABSTOPS is a list of the numeric tabstops.
-truncate, -tc
   truncates lines to 80 characters without warning.


List of input control arguments (to process imcv and library files):
-imcv NAMES
   specifies that the input is an IMCV tape or file from which the
   jobs listed by NAMES are to be extracted into separate output
   files.  NAMES may be either a list of snumbs, or "-all" meaning to
   extract all jobs, or -file_input PATH (see).
-library NAMES, -lib NAMES
   input file contains several source decks where NAMES is a list of
   edit names of decks to extract from the library to write to
   separate output files.  NAMES may be either a list of edit names,
   or "-all" meaning to extract all decks, or -file_input PATH (see).
-list NAMES, -ls NAMES
   specifies a list of Multics files as input.  NAMES is either a list
   of file names or -file_input PATH (see).


-file_input PATH, -fi PATH
   specifies that the NAMES list is contained in a segment whose
   pathname is PATH.
-label LABEL, -lbl LABEL
   selects the tape file identified by LABEL for reading.  LABEL is
   either the tape file name or the ordinal number of the desired file
   on the tape.


List of input control arguments (to select records):
-first N, -ft N
   is the number of the first line to be copied.
-last N, -lt N
   is the number of the last line to be copied.
-count N, -ct N
   is the number of lines to be copied.


List of input or output control arguments (for tape processing):
-tape TAPE_ID
   specifies a GCOS magnetic tape as input or output.  TAPE_ID is
   either the tape number or the tape number with the deensity
   appended as 12345,den=1600.  The default density is 800 bpi.
-attached, -att
   tape remains attached from a previous use of this command.
-retain, -ret
   tape remains attached when the command finishes.
-detach, -det
   detaches a tape retained by a previous use of this command.


List of output control arguments:
-output, -out
   specifies the beginning of the output part of the command.  Not
   necessary if the output is a single pathname and unambiguous.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses printing of nonfatal error messages.
-long, -lg
   Names items selected for copying as they are written to output.
   Prints all input item names and indicates those selected for
   copying.


List of output control arguments (to specify format):
-ascii, -aci
   specifies Multics ASCII text format.  May be omitted if the
   pathname has the suffix ".ascii".  This is the default format for
   non-tape files.
-gcos, -gc
   indicates file is in GCOS Standard System Format.  The output will
   be GCOS BCD card images (media code 2) if the input is Multics
   ASCII.  Otherwise, the output records are copied directly from the
   input (except COMDK records which may be expanded, and binary
   records which are never copied).  May be omitted of the pathname
   has the suffix ".gcos".  This is the default format for output tape
   files.


-gcos_ascii, -gca
   indicates the output file is written as a GCOS time-sharing ASCII
   file.
-gcos_bcd, -gcb
   indicates the output file is written as a GCOS BCD card image file
   (media code 2).
-raw
   indicates file contains card images, in the format produced by the
   Multics I/O daemon, for card output in raw mode.  May be omitted if
   the pathname has the suffix ".raw".
-comdk, -cdk
   will compress all cards except binary cards and dollar cards before
   writing them to the output file.  May be omitted if pathname has
   the suffix ".comdk".


List of output control arguments (to write to output files):
-append, -app
   appends output to an already existing output file immediately
   following its current contents.
-label LABEL, -lbl LABEL
   write the file out to tape with the file name specified by LABEL.
-list NAMES, -ls NAMES
   specifies a list of Multics files to be copied into.  NAMES is
   either a list of file names, or -file_input PATH, or "-name" which
   indicates that the files names are to taken from the edit names of
   an input library or the snumb names of an imcv file.


-file_input PATH, -fi PATH
   specifies that the NAMES list is contained in a segment whose
   pathname is PATH.
-truncate, -tc
   truncate the output records to 80 characters.


Notes:
Only GCOS BCD card image files (media code 2) are limited to 80
characters per record (line or card).  The -truncate control argument
must be used when writing lines longer than 80 characters to such a
file.

When converting GCOS files to Multics ASCII, non-comdk binary records
are discarded since they cannot be converted.

Multics or GCOS ASCII files containing tab characters must be
canonicalized if converted to non-ASCII.

Only GCOS files may be read from or written to tape.


Examples:
A Multics ASCII segment "readable.jcl" is to be converted into a GCOS
BCD card image file named "GJOB".  Canonicalization is to be done with
tab stops at 8, 16, and 32:
   gcu readable.jcl -ascii -can -tabs 8 16 32 -out GJOB -gcos_bcd
A GCOS TSS formated file "SPCWRS" is to be converted into a Multics
ASCII segment:
   gcu SPCWRS -gcos space_wars.fortran
The source program "TSSA" is to be extracted from GCOS 800bpi tape
"U8421" which is a library of COMDKs (a K* tape):
   gcu -in -tape u8421 -comdk -lib tssa -out tssa.ascii
A GCOS BCD file named "pswdlst.gcos" is to be converteed to a Multics
ASCII text file:
   gcu pswdlst.gcos password.list.ascii


A GCOS 1600bpi tape "12DO" contains a BCD file to be copied to a
Multics ASCII text file called "gcos_manuals":
   gcu -input -tape 12do,den=1600 -output gcos_manuals -ascii
