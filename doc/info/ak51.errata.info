pg 3-9:  replace 'lot_size" with the following:                   |
                                                                  |
         lot_size:  decimal_integer {, stack } ;                  |

         Lot_size:  decimal_integer {, stack };                   |
                                    {, own   }                    |
                                                                  |
         where decimal_integer is the size of the user's linkage  |
         offset table (LOT) in words.  The LOT is a per-ring      |
         array of pointers that point to the linkage information  |
         for each procedure segment known in the given ring.      |
         "Stack" indicates that the lot will be allocated in the  |
         user stack, "own' that it will not.  The default (if     |
         neither is specified) is "stack".                        |


pg 3-9:  replace 'cls_size' with the following:                   |
                                                                  |
         cls_size:  decimal_integer {, stack } ;                  |
                                    {, own   }                    |
         Cls_size:  decimal_integer {, stack };                   |
                                    {, own   }                    |
                                                                  |
         where decimal_integer is the size of the user's initial  |
         combined linkage region in words.  "Stack" indicates     |
         that the cls will be allocated in the user stack, "own"  |
         that it will not.  The default (if neither is specified) |
         is "own".                                                |
