02/15/80 dot_page.compin, dot_page_off.compin

Syntax: .srv add_date   "publish_date"
        .srv add_letter "what_addendum"
        .ifi dot_page   what_addendum{,blank_page}
and at the top of the page where normal page counting resumes
        .ifi dot_page_off
        {.srv add_date   ""} (see Notes)
        {.srv add_letter ""}


Function:
The dot_page macro creates addendum footer lines when composed.  It
1) turns on the date and addendum letter portion of the footers
2) turns on an automatic counter for 'point' pages
3) generates blank 'backup' pages if necessary (see Notes)

The dot_page_off macro restores the page counter to the counting
sequence in effect before the dot_page macro was called. BEWARE!  These
macros cause page breaks.


Arguments:
'publish_date' is the month and year, in the form mm/yy (e.g., 10/20),
   that this addendum is published (generally, 'published' here means
   'brought to the printer'). Leading zeros are not used, so a publish
   date of August 1978 would be 8/78 not 08/78.
'what_addendum' is a single capital letter, indicating which addendum
   this is (i.e., A is the first addendm; B, second; etc.). The value
   assigned to 'add_letter' appears in the page footer and the value
   given in the call to 'dot_page' is used for changed page selection.
'blank_page' may be any non-blank character to indicate that a needed
   blank page (see Notes) should precede the added 'point' page(s).  If
   no 'blank_page' character is given, the blank page follows the point
   page(s). This feature allows the user to avoid the facing blank
   pages that are usually considered not good practice.


Notes:
1) In order to add addendum pages, knowledge of the current and correct
   placement of all text on the pages involved is necessary.  Also,
   keep in mind that use of either of these macros forces a new page so
   placement of the dot_page macro call line is crucial.
2) The use of the two '.srv' lines following the dot_page_off call line
   is shown as optional.  If the page following the desired 'point'
   page(s) contains change bars, the '.srv' lines should not be given;
   if it does not contain change bars, they should be given so that a
   possible obverse unmodified page will have a proper footer.
3) The dot_page macro assumes that the material will be submitted for
   printing and therefore both sides of the printed page must be
   considered.  If a blank page is required, it is labeled as such
   ("This page intentionally left blank.") and the proper addendum
   footers (without a page number) are generated.


   Examples:
   Assume compose encounters the following lines in the compin segment
   as it is formatting the twelfth page of the section (numbered either
   12 or <section_number>-12).

      .srv add_date "8/78"
      .srv add_letter "B"
      .ifi dot_page B

   These lines add the addendum publish date in the left side of the
   footer; add the addendum letter to the order number in the footer;
   turn on the point page page number counter so the next page number
   is 12.1, next is 12.2, etc. (or <section_number>-12.1,
   <section_number>-12.2, etc. if you have put in a '.srv section
   <section_number>' line earlier); and, if a blank backup page is
   needed, put it at the end of the point pages.


      .ifi dot_page_off

   turns off the point page counter and returns to normal page numbers
   so the next page number is 13 (or <section_number>-13).	Since the
   add_date and add_letter values were not reset, the footer will
   continue to show those value.

   If the following lines are encountered in the compin segment as the
   twelfth page is being formatted

      .srv add_date "8/78"
      .srv add_letter "B"
      .ifi dot_page B,x

   compose generates formatted pages exactly as the example above
   except a blank page will precede the point pages.
