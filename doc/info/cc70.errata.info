pg 1-1:  after the description of "Directories" add the
     following.

         Archives

         Archives are segments that contain other segments
         (called components).  Archives are frequently used to
         store and manipulate groups of related segments.


pg 1-2 to 1-3:  to the description of "pathnames" add the
     following.

         If the final entryname of a path has a double colon in
         it, then the pathname is an archive component pathname.
         That part of the final entryname that is before the
         double colon is the name of an archive segment.  That
         portion of the entryname that follows the double colon
         is used to identify the individual archive segment.


pg 3-1 to 3-2:  change all references of "source segment" to
     "source program".
