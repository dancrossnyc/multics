08/14/84  display_mrds_dsm, dmdsm

Syntax as a command:  dmdsm dsm_path {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays information about the specified MRDS
data submodel.


Arguments:
dsm_path
   is the pathname of the data submodel file to be displayed.  If
   dsm_path does not have a suffix of dsm, then one is assumed.
   However, the dsm suffix must be the last component of the data
   submodel file name.


Control arguments:
-access, -acc
   specifies that access information (both relation and attribute) is
   to be displayed.
-brief, -bf
   specifies that only the submodel relation names and attribute names
   are to be displayed.  This control argument may be superseded by any
   of -cmdsm, -rel_names, or -long which follow it in the command line.
   (Default)


-cmdsm
   specifies that the display is to have a format that may be processed
   by the create_mrds_dsm command to produce another submodel.  This
   control argument is limited to DBAs if the submodel is associated
   with a secure data base.  This control argument may be superseded by
   any of -long, -rel_names, or -brief which follow it in the command
   line.


-long, -lg
   specifies that the display is to contain all the information that is
   in the submodel.  This includes the data base path, submodel
   version, submodel creation date and creator, submodel relation names
   and associated model relation names, submodel attribute names and
   associated model attribute names, relation and attribute access, and
   the attribute data types.  If the person running this command is not
   a DBA and the submodel is associated with a secure data base, then
   the model relation names and model attribute names will not be
   displayed.  This control argument may be superseded by any of
   -cmdsm, -rel_names, or -brief which follow it in the command line.
-no_access, -nacc
   specifies that access information is not to be displayed.


-no_output_file, -nof
   causes the output display to be written to the terminal.  This
   control argument will undo the effects of the -output_file control
   argument.  (Default)
-output_file path, -of path
   causes the output display to be written to the specified path
   instead of to the terminal.  Anything already stored in the segment
   at the specified path will be overwritten.
-rel_names, -rn
   specifies that only submodel relation names are to be displayed.
   This control argument may be superseded by any of -cmdsm, -brief, or
   -long which follow it in the command line.


-relation rel_1 rel_2 ...  rel_N
   specifies that information about rel_1 through rel_N is to be
   displayed.  The information about each relation is displayed in the
   order they are specified.  If some specified relation rel_I does not
   exist in the submodel an error is reported and the display proceeds
   with the next relation.  If the display is going to an output file,
   the error is reported both to the terminal and the output file.
   This control argument may be used with the control arguments -cmdsm,
   -long, -rel_names, and -brief to produce a display of part of the
   submodel.  (The default displays all relations)
