Syntax:  .ifi lXmhbox "paragraph-title"


Function:
These macros perform all the functions of their lXmh.compin
counterparts with the addition of constructing a boxed page header for
those 'paragraph-titles' that would not automatically get one because
of their format and placing that same boxed header on the page just
ahead of the usual title header.

See corrseponding lXmh.compin.info for more information.
