Syntax as a command:  wh names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [wh name {-control_args}]


Function: uses the standard search rules to search for a given file
or entry point.


Arguments:
names
   are file and entry point names.  You can't use the star
   convention.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   lists the pathnames of all files and entry points with the
   specified names that you can find using the current search rules,
   your effective access to each segment or entry point, and the name
   of the search rule used to find each file or entry point.  It is
   incompatible with -long.
-brief, -bf
   prints only the pathname of each entry found.  (Default)
-entry_point, -ep
   searches for entry points.  If a name argument does not contain a
   dollar sign, the command searches for the entry point name$name.


-inhibit_error, -ihe
   does not print an error message if no files can be found for a
   given name.  For the command no output is printed, for the active
   function the null string is returned.
-long, -lg
   prints the pathname, the name of the search rule used to find each
   segment or MSF, and your effective access to the file.
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   prints an error message if no segments or MSFs can be found for a
   given name.  (Default)
-segment, -sm, -file
   searches for segments or MSFs.  (Default, unless name contains a $)


Notes:  The command prints out the full pathname of the file, using
its primary name, and the entry point name if you request one.  If the
file or entry point is not in the search path, an error message is
printed.

The primary name of a storage system entry is the name that is first in
the list of names on that entry.

If you supply -all, where prints information only about the first
matching file or entry point encountered.



The -entry_point and -file control arguments are mutually exclusive.
If you provide one of them, all the name arguments are assumed to be of
the type specified.  If you give neither -entry_point nor -file,
where scans the name arguments:  any name arguments that contain a
dollar sign are assumed to be names of entry points; all others, names
of files.

See "Search Rules" in the Programmer's Reference Manual.


Notes on active function:  The active function returns the pathname of
the file.  You can't use -all, -brief, and -long.  Unless you supply
-inhibit_error, an error occurs if no segment or MSF can be found.
