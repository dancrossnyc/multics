Syntax:  .ifi command "command usage line"


Function:
This macro places a command usage syntax description on the page.


Macro action:
1) inserts 24pt of white space
2) emits the label "SYNTAX AS A COMMAND" in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italic
   flush left, followed by white space appropriate for the device
3) formats "command usage line" in 10pt Helvetica (also see Notes) at
   the first indentation level


Notes:
1) If "command usage line" contains white space, it must be given as a
   quoted string.
2) "command usage line" may contain both literal fields and variable
   fields.  These fields are distinguished in the output by presenting
   the variable fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italic instead of Roman.
   Variable fields are denoted by enclosing them between tilde (~)
   characters.  For example

      "command ~args~ {-~control_args~}"

   will present "command" in Roman and "arg" and "control_args" in Bold
   Italic.
