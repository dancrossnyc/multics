Description

1090  phx18132
The DRUN facility of gtss is making some invalid assumptions about what
to return when a DRL is executed from a DRUN.  This can cause RUNOFF to
fail if executed in a DRUN.

1089  phx17058
Physical record processing in $UTILITY will usually result in an abort.
This is because the gcos simulator does not handle multiple dcw lists
correctly for tape IO.  Tape IO with lists of IOTPs will fail.

1088  phx16384
The gcos simulator may not return the correct data in the A register on
sucessful completion of a MME GECALL.

1087  phx08471
Simulation of MME GECALL and MME GERSTR do not give valid results if a
non-zero load origin is given.

1086  phx07434
If a file allocated by gtss grows to a msf, its unique id in the mcfc
data base will change allowing new allocations to bypass the mcfc
mechanism.

1085  phx04086
The gcos_tss multiple caller file control (mcfc) data base sometimes has
entries retained after the caller exits gtss.  Some of these entries are
for directories which should never appear.  There should be no entries
for a caller who has exited gtss.

1084  phx03121
The gcos batch simulator will not process H* files from tape.  These
files must be true disk files to be used properly.

1073  phx15715
The gtss mcfc database is unprotected.  The segments GTSS.MCFC.* have
rew access to *.*.*.  This is necessary for gtss to provide concurrency
control for gtss files.  These mcfc files are not accessable to gtss
users normally

1066  phx15272
If a gcos batch job quits abnormally and leaves the sysprint file
unclosed, gcos_sysprint cannot print it.  Instead, gcos_sysprint will go
into an infinite loop reporting that it has reached the end of
information.

1062  phx15034 phx15266
If GTSS is invoked while using window_call (or video mode) it puts out
the error message that it can't get the terminal attributes and quits.

1060  phx19399
A crun in gtss will terminate output (cout) after about 140 lines as if
this was the proper thing to do.  Remaining output is thrown away
somewhere.

1044  phx02637
Run units (H*, **) created by the batch simulator via MME GESAVEcannot
be used by gtss.  The batch simulator H*'s are not native GCOS mode but
gtss requires native GCOS H*'s.

1039  phx14478
Using GFMS may fail due to no more room in the known seg table (KST).

1022  phx12722
Objects to option fields on certain control cards if they are over 6
characters long.  Since the real GCOS accepts longer fields, so should
we.

1021  phx12303 phx12802 phx17231
When writting to tape, GCU fails to flush out the last buffer if it is
not full.  This results in leaving off data from the end of a tape file.
Also, it is doing a less-than-optimal job of translating data to GCOS
BCD format.

1014  phx03694
YFORTRAN doesn't function at all.  Just says "please retype last
command".

1013  phx03920
gcos_user$print only accepts 1 argument.

1009  phx07777 phx07604 phx01933
If a tape drive is assigned that provides both density 1600 and density
6250 the gcos "UTILITY" program institutes a label checking procedure
that is assured to fail.  This is a result of its checking density
dynamically and not processing the hardware i/o status codes properly.
If a drive with density 1600 and less is assigned failure will not
occur.  It is not possible to use Multics "resource control" as the
simulator implements the functionality required by gcos at the MME
level.
