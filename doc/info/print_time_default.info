07/22/86  print_time_defaults, ptd


Syntax as a command:  ptd {keys} {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [ptd key {-control_arg}]


Function:  displays system or process time-related defaults.


Arguments:
key
   selects which default value is to be displayed.


Control arguments:
-system, -sys
   requests that the system defaults be displayed instead of the
   process defaults.


List of keys:
date
   displays the default date format.  A date format shows the year,
   month, and day in month.
date_time
   displays the default date/time format.  This combines both date and
   time.
debug, db
   displays the default status of debugging in the date/time system.


language, lang
   displays the default language.  Any time words in output time
   strings are in this language.
time
   displays the default time format.  A time format shows the hour,
   minutes, and (optionally) seconds.
zone
   displays the default time zone name.  Unless explicitly specified,
   all input time strings are interpreted relative to this zone and all
   output time values are expressed in this zone.


Notes:  If set_time_default has pushed any values, these are also
shown.  The keys specify which defaults to print.  When called with no
keys, all time-related defaults are displayed, except for the debugging
switch which is shown only if it is on.  As an active function, it
returns the current value of one of the defaults.  The debugging switch
is returned as "true" if debugging is on, and "false" otherwise.

The values displayed are in the order date, date_time, time,
language, zone, and debug.
