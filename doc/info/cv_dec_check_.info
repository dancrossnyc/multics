:Entry: cv_dec_check_: 02/06/84  cv_dec_check_

Function: accepts an ASCII representation of a decimal integer and
returns the fixed binary(35) representation of that number.  This
function differs from cv_dec_ only in that a code is returned
indicating the possibility of a conversion error.  (See also cv_dec_).


Syntax:
declare cv_dec_check_ entry (char(*), fixed bin(35))
     returns (fixed bin(35));
a = cv_dec_check_ (string, code);


Arguments:
string
   is the string to be converted.  (Input)
code
   is a code that equals 0 if no error has occurred; otherwise, it is
   the index of the character of the input string that terminated the
   conversion.  See "Notes" below.  (Output)
a
   is the result of the conversion.  (Output)


Notes:  Code is not a standard status code and, therefore, cannot be
passed to com_err_ and other subroutines that accept only standard
status codes.

This function can be performed more efficiently in PL/I by--

      on conversion,size goto badnumber;
      a = convert (a, string);
      revert conversion,size;
         .
         .
         .
      badnumber:
      call com_err_ (error_table_$bad_conversion, proc, string);
      return;
