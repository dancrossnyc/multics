Syntax:  gssr


Function: prints the definitions of site-defined search rule keywords
acceptable to set_search_rules.


Notes: If you include a site-defined keyword in the search segment
accepted by set_search_rules, the site-defined keyword expands into
its definition in the order printed by gssr.

See the print_search_rules, add_search_rules, delete_search_rules, and
set_search_rules info segments.  The standard search rules are
described in Section 4, under "Search Rules," of the Programmer's
Reference Manual (AG91).
