08/12/83, GCOS Environment Simulation

This info segment describes an overview of the GCOS simulation
capabilities on Multics.  For a list of GCOS-related info segments,
see below.  For a brief summary of their contents, type "help
gcos*.** -header"


Functions simulated:
There are two simulators, one for batch processing, and one for time
sharing.  Both simulators catch the supervisor calls, DRLs and MMEs,
by the slave programs and perform the functions requested.  Most
slave programs, in native GCOS object code, are accommodated.  This
includes all the standard system software and the L* subroutine
library.


Major user commands:
gcos,		     for the batch simulator
gcos_tss, gtss,	     for the time sharing simulator
gcos_card_utility, gcu,  for media conversion between GCOS and Multics
gcos_fms, gfms,	     for restoring FILSYS save tapes onto Multics

A GCOS Daemon facility is provided for batch users of card and IMCV
job inputs.  Other commands are available and will be listed in the
help output mentioned above.


Software release levels:
The GCOS software release level for both the batch and the time
sharing simulators is 4JS3.  Only the bundled GCOS software is
provided but tools are available to install separately obtained PSP
or other software.


General differences/limitations:
The GCOS FMS extended functions, such as concurrent access control,
delayed posting, test mode, etc., are not provided.  GCOS system
operator interfaces are not provided, except for card and IMCV tape
input.


Batch Differences/limitations:
The user's terminal is treated as the GCOS system console for the
batch job submitted.  Messages such as SRT, EOJ etc.  are printed
directly on the terminal just as they would appear on the GCOS
console.  The slave program SSA is not maintained.  The Multics path
name may be specified on any $ file card and no concurrency checking
is done.


TSS Differences/limitations:
GTSS uses Multics terminal interfaces; all functions provided by the
Multics set_tty command are available (such as line and character
delete).  Paper tape is not supported.  CARDIN is not supported since
batch jobs are submitted from a terminal with the gcos command.


Documentation:
All facilities are described in the GCOS Environment Simulator
manual, Order No.  AN05.

User libraries:
The user of either simulator may use other versions of system
software and subroutine libraries by specifying the -userlib
control_arg on the command line and having links set up to the
desired libraries.  For example, to use the GCOS 3/I software, one
would do the following:

 link >unb>gcos_system_software_3i_ gcos_system_software_
 link >unb>gcos_library_subroutines_3i_ gcos_library_subroutines_
 gcos my_jcl -userlib
