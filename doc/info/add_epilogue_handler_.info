:Entry: add_epilogue_handler_: 02/13/84  add_epilogue_handler_

Function: adds an entry to the list of those handlers called when a
process or run unit is terminated.  A program established as an
epilogue handler during a run unit is called when the run unit is
terminated.  If the process continues after the run unit is
terminated, the handler is discarded from the list of those called
when the process is terminated.  Hence, epilogue handlers established
during a run unit are not retained beyond the life of the run unit.


Syntax:
declare add_epilogue_handler_ entry (entry, fixed bin (35));
call add_epilogue_handler_ (ev, code);


Arguments:
ev
   is an entry value to be placed on the list of such values to be
   called when the run unit or process is cleaned up.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes: This subroutine effectively manages two lists of epilogue
handlers: those for the run unit, if a run unit is active, and those
for the process.  While a run unit is active, it is not possible to
add entries to the list for the process.  There is no way to establish
a process epilogue handler while a run unit is active.  The caller of
execute_epilogue_ (logout, new_proc, etc.) must indicate whether all
or just the run unit handlers are to be invoked.
