Syntax as a command:  dmdbs path {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays the current state of the data base
concurrency control segment.  The number and type of open users of the
data base can be determined from its output.  The current scope
settings on all relations in the user's view can be displayed.


Arguments:
path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the data base, or of a
   submodel defined for that data base, for which concurrency control
   information is desired.  If both a data model and submodel of the
   same name are in the same directory, the model will be found if no
   suffix is given.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   causes display of only the current number of open users and the
   number of active scope users of the data base.
-long, -lg
   causes all possible concurrency control information to be displayed
   that is in the user's view.  This includes the concurrency control
   version, whether the data base has been quiesced, consistency state
   of the data base control segment, existence of any dead processes,
   identification of the processes having the data base open, and what
   scope they have set on relations that are in the user's view.
-proc_id process_number, -pid process_number
   same as is used for -user, but the process number is used for the
   identifier instead.


-user person.project, -user person
   causes all possible concurrency control information (such as -long)
   for the person.project or person given to be displayed, including
   scope setting on relations in the user's view.


Notes:  If no control arguments are specified, then an abbreviated form
of the information given by the -long option is presented.

The output display does not include "normal" conditions, such as
"Activation:  normal".  Only exception conditions or necessary
information are displayed (e.g., "Non-passive scope set by a dead
process.", or "open users:  0") unless the -long option is specified.
