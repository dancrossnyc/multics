Syntax:  .ifi lXsetup "title-line"


Function:
These macros set up the proper environment and perform all the 'side
effect' processing (including the generation of any implied page
headers) as for the equivalent level header macros, but do NOT emit the
header title or the Table of Contents entries.


Arguments:
'title-line' the text of the section/paragraph title as for the
   equivalent level header macro.


Notes:
1) Use of these macros is generally limited to special addenda work
   (e.g., a long document in which only the last five pages change and
   they are prepared in a new segment or new material is being added
   but kept in a separate segment.)


Examples:
Assume that section 3 of my_doc is about 200 pages long and a summary
portion is being added in addendum A following page 3-125.	The
following lines could be the beginning of that separate summary
segment:

        .ifi init "ZZnn"
        .srv section "3"
        .ifi l0setup "section-3-subject"
        .brp 3-125
        .ifi dot_page
        .srv add_letter "A"
        .srv add_date "7/78"
        .ifi l2h "Summary"
	   A summary of the above is...
