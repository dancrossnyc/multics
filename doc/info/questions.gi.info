01/24/84  Questions

Many multics programs ask questions of the user when they require some
information.  These questions are all handled by the same program, and
there are some system-wide conventions regarding them.


Command processor escape:
Any answer beginning with ".." is passed directly to the Multics
command processor (cu_$cp) with the leading dots stripped off, rather
than being returned to the caller of command_query_.  After the
command line has executed, command_query_ prompts again with "Answer:",
rather than asking the question again, since the question can be
long and it has already been printed once.

This escape feature allows the user considerably more flexibility in
answering the question; if the question is unexpected, and apparently
makes no sense, the user can issue a command or two to try and find
out what prompted it.


Examples:
! delete *.pl1

  delete: calliope.pl1 is protected.  Do you want to delete it?  ! ..list

  Segments = 3, length = 7

  re     2  calliope
  re     1  calliope.pl1
  re     4  calliope.list

  Answer:  ! ..print_wdir
  >udd>CIRCUS>Elephant>work
  Answer:  ! ..repeat_query

  delete:  calliope.pl1 is protected.  Do you wish to delete it?  ! no


The repeat_query command:
As seen in the example, the repeat_query command can also be used
during a question sequence, if it is necessary to see the question
again; if it has been scrolled off the top of a CRT terminal screen,
for instance.  Type "help repeat_query" for details.
