Syntax:  xforum {-control_args}


Function:  invokes the Executive Forum facility


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
    rebuilds the meeting list using the current search paths.
-no_force, -nfc
    uses the original meeting list.  (Default)


Meeting Lists:
Executive Forum uses three types of meeting lists -- one for meetings
that the user is eligible to attend, one for meetings the user
regularly attends, and one for meetings that have changed since the
user last attended them.  The list of meetings the user is eligible to
attend is established the first time the user invokes Executive Forum
during a login session.  It is constructed from the search paths in
effect at that time.


If a meeting is added to those search paths, that is, the search paths
remain the same but the meetings in them change, the -force control
argument must be used to reconstruct the meeting list.  Otherwise, the
previously constructed meeting list is used.


If the user's search paths change, Executive Forum notices the
differences when it is invoked and asks the user whether or not the
meeting list should be reconstructed.


Notes:  To start the Executive Forum facility, type either
"executive_forum" or "xforum" when a ready message (usually of the form
"r 14:03 0.285 5") appears on the terminal screen just above the
cursor.  Users operate Executive Forum by selecting operations from
lists called menus.  All help needed to operate the system is available
within the Executive Forum facility itself.


Executive Forum has exactly the same AIM limitations as Forum.
Meetings are single-class segments.  All participants must be logged in
at the same authorization, which must be the access class of the
meeting.  Different meetings, however may be at different access
classes.  The access class of a meeting is the authorization of the
chairman at the time the meeting was created.
