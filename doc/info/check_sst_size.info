Syntax:  check_sst_size {-control_args}


Function: displays the sizes of the SST header, AST hash table and
each of the 4 pools that are found in sst_seg along with the total
size of the sst_seg.

Control arguments:
-4k N
   specifies that the 4k AST pool is to have N entries.

-16k N
   specifies that the 16k AST pool is to have N entries.

-64k N
   specifies that the 64k AST pool is to have N entries.

-256k N
   specifies that the 256K AST pool is to have N entries.

-pathname STR, -pn STR
   specifies that the configuration deck with a pathname of STR is to
   be used.


Notes:
If any one of the -4k, -16k, -64k or -256k control arguments are not
used, a configuration deck will be used to supply the missing values.

The configuration deck, if needed, is found with the user's search
rules if the -pathname option is not used on the command line.
