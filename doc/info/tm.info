07/25/86  terminate, tm

Syntax as a command:  tm paths


Function: removes a segment or MSF from your address space and resets
links to the terminated file. It is commonly used prior to initiating
a different version of a program.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of files to be terminated.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the error message printed when a file to be terminated
   is not known (initiated).
-long, -lg
   does not suppress the above error message.  (Default)
-name STR, -nm STR
   specifies an entryname STR that begins with a minus sign, to
   distinguish it from a control argument.


Notes: Be careful not to unintentionally terminate a segment of the
command language interpreter or another critical piece of the
environment.  Fatal process errors usually result from such an action.

The star convention is not recognized.

Terminating a multisegment file will terminate only component 0 of the
MSF unless it is an object MSF, in which case all of the components will
be terminated.
