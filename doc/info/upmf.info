Syntax:  upmf Project_id Person_id


Function: allows the accounting administrator to add a user to a
project.  It is used only on projects that are not delegated.  The
command extracts the project's PMF from the pmf.archive segment (in
the >udd>SysAdmin>admin directory), edits the PMF to add the new
entry, converts the PMF to a PDT, signals the initializer to install
the PDT, and replaces the edited PMF in pmf.archive.  The user is
added with no individual attributes, just those of the project.  To
give individual attributes to the user, use the pmf command.


Arguments:
Project_id
   is the Project_id of the project on which a user is to be added.
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user to be added to the project.
