(Describes changes to the MR10.1 version of the cv_pmf command.)


The cv_pmf command has been changed to allow the name of the
Project Master File (PMF) segment to end with the suffix ".pmf".
For compatability with previous versions of the command, it is
not necessary that the PMF segment name have this suffix.


The command "cv_pmf PMF_name" will cause cv_pmf to first look for
the segment PMF_name.pmf. If it is found, it is converted and
the result placed in the segment PMF_name.pdt. If the segment
PMF_name.pmf is not found, cv_pmf will look for the segment PMF_name;
if it is found, cv_pmf prints a warning message and converts the
PMF, placing the output in the segment PMF_name.pdt.
If neither segment is found, an error message is printed.


cv_pmf error processing:

If errors occur during conversion, cv_pmf will delete the
output segment (PMF_name.pdt) only if just created by cv_pmf.
If the segment existed before this invocation of cv_pmf, it will
be truncated.

cv_pmf now supports the severity active function.  The result of
[severity cv_pmf] is the highest severity of any warning or error which
occured during the conversion.
