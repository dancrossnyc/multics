08/22/83  initiate_file_

The initiate_file_ subroutine contains entry points for making a
segment or archive component known with a null reference name.


Entry points in initiate_file_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  initiate_file_:  03/29/82 initiate_file_


Function:  The initiate_file_ entry point, given a directory name,
entry name, and access mode, checks that the user's process has at
least the desired access on the specified segment.  If so, the segment
is initiated with a null reference name.  This entry point returns a
pointer to the base of the segment and the bit count of the segment.


Syntax:
declare initiate_file_ entry (char (*), char (*), bit (*), pointer,
     fixed binary (24), fixed binary (35));
call initiate_file_ (dirname, entryname, mode, seg_ptr, bit_count,
     code);


Arguments:
dirname
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the segment.  (Input)
mode
   is the required access mode to the segment.  (Input) The first three
   bits correspond to the modes read, execute, and write.  The
   remaining bits, if any, must be zero.  Named constants for the
   access modes are declared in access_mode_values.incl.pl1.
seg_ptr
   if the segment was made known, this is a pointer to the base of the
   segment.  Otherwise, this is null.  (Output)


bit_count
   is the bit count of the segment.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)  It may have one of the
   following values:
   error_table_$no_r_permission
        read permission was required but not present
   error_table_$no_e_permission
        execute permission was required but not present
   error_table_$no_w_permission
        write permission was required but not present


Notes:  The specified segment must exist, and the user must have
nonnull access to it, as well as the required modes, in order to make
it known.

If making the segment known encounters the error_table_$segknown status
code, a zero status code is returned instead.  This enables the user of
this entry point to test either the returned pointer, or the status
code, to indicate whether the segment was made known or not.

The hcs_$terminate_noname entry point or the terminate_file_ subroutine
should be used to make the segment unknown.


:Entry:  create:  09/22/86  initiate_file_$create


Function:  initiates the specified segment with a null reference
provided that the user's process has at least the desired access to the
segment.  If the segment does not exist, it will be created .


Syntax:
dcl  initiate_file_$create entry (char (*), char (*), bit (*), pointer,
	bit (1) aligned, fixed binary (24), fixed binary (35));
call initiate_file_$create (dirname, entryname, mode, seg_ptr, created,
	bit_count, code);


Arguments:
dirname
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the segment.  (Input)
mode
   is the required access mode to the segment.  The first three bits
   correspond to the modes read, execute, and write.  The remaining
   bits, if any, must be zero.  Named constants for the access modes
   are declared in access_mode_values.incl.pl1.  (Input)
seg_ptr
   is set to a pointer to the base of the segment if successfull;
   otherwise, it is set to null.  (Output)
created
   is set to "1"b if the segment did not exist and was created by this
   call; otherwise, it is set to "0"b.  (Output)


bit_count
   is set to the bit count of the segment.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)  It may have one of the
   following values:
   error_table_$no_m_permission
        the segment did not exist and could not be created with the
        required access.
   error_table_$no_r_permission
        read permission was required but not present
   error_table_$no_e_permission
        execute permission was required but not present
   error_table_$no_w_permission
        write permission was required but not present


Notes:
If making the segment known encounters the error_table_$segknown status
code, a zero status code is returned instead.  This enables the user of
this entry point to test either the returned pointer, or the status
code, to indicate whether the segment was made known or not.

The terminate_file_ subroutine should be used to make the segment
unknown.  If the segment was create by this call and the caller
terminates abnormally or its cleanup handler is invoked, the caller may
use the delete option of terminate_file_ to remove the segment that was
created.


:Entry:  component:  03/09/82  initiate_file_$component


Function:  This entry point can make either a segment or an archive
component known with a null reference name.

If the component name is null, this entry point is identical to
initiate_file_.

Otherwise, the directory name and entry name arguments are assumed to
specify an achive, and the component name specifies a component within
that archive.  If the user's process has at least the desired acces on
the archive segment, and the user desires no more than read access,
then the archive is made known with a null reference name, and a
segment number is assigned.  This entry point returns a pointer to the
base of the component and the bit count of the component.


Syntax:
declare initiate_file_$component entry (char (*), char (*), char (*),
     bit (*), pointer, fixed binary (24), fixed binary (35));
call initiate_file_$component (dirname, entryname, component_name,
     mode, component_ptr, bit_count, code);


Arguments:
dirname
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   if component_name is null, this is the entryname of the segment.
   Otherwise, this is the entryname of an archive.  The archive suffix
   must be supplied.  (Input)
component_name
   is null, or is the name of a component in the archive.  (Input)
mode
   is the required access mode to the segment.  (Input) The first three
   bits correspond to the modes read, execute, and write.  The
   remaining bits, if any, must be zero.  Named constants for the
   access modes are declared in access_mode_values.incl.pl1.


component_ptr
   if the segment was made known, this is a pointer to the base of the
   segment or the base of the archive component.  Otherwise, this is
   null.  (Output)
bit_count
   is the bit count of the segment or archive component.  (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)  In addition to the above
   values, it may have:
   error_table_$archive_component_modification
        write permission was required on an archive component


Notes:  The notes for the initiate_file_ entry point apply to this
entry point also.

If a nonnull component name is specified, the following constraints
apply to the use of this entry point:
 (1) The component may not be modified.  Only read access is permitted.
 (2) The component is guaranteed to be contiguous and aligned on a word
     boundary.  It is not guaranteed to have any other alignment.
 (3) No explicit dependence on the format of archives is permitted.
     This means that only the data starting at the pointer and
     extending as far as the bit count may be referenced.  No data
     before or after the component may be referenced.
