07/04/86  date_compiled, dtc

Syntax as a command:  dtc path {-control_arg} {components}


Syntax as an active function:  [dtc path {-control_arg} {components}]


Function:  prints the date and time compiled and the compiler
identifier for an object file or an archive of object segments.  For
a bound object file, the command prints the date and time compiled
for each component.

The active function returns the first line of output that would be
printed if it were invoked as a command.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of an object segment, bound object segment,
   bound object MSF, or an archive of object segments.
components
   are names of components in a bound object file or archive of
   object segments.  If component names are supplied, information on
   only these components is listed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   lists the date and time compiled only.
-long, -lg
   lists the date and time compiled, the file name, your User_id,
   and the long form of the compiler identifier.


Notes:  If an archive is listed, the bind file is ignored.

If neither control argument is specified, the command lists the date
and time compiled, the file name, the User_id, and the short
compiler identifier.
