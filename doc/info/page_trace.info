11/01/76  page_trace, pgt

Syntax:  pgt {N} {-control_args}


Function: prints a recent history of page faults and other system events within
the calling process.


Arguments: 
N
   print last N system events. (DEFAULT-- print all events in trace list.)


Control arguments: 
-long, -lg
   print full pathname where appropriate. (DEFAULT -- entrynames only.)
-no_header, -nhe
   do not print header preceding output.
-from STR, -fm STR
   start printing at first user-marker matching STR.
-to STR
   stop printing at first user-marker matching STR.
-output_switch swname, -os swname
   write output on swname, which must be attached and open.
-no_pagefaults, -npf
   omit output about pagefaults.


Notes: Segment numbers can be reused within a process. Since it is the segment
numbers that are stored in the trace list, the pathnames and entrynames printed
by pgt may correspond to present initiations of a segment as opposed to those
in effect when the fault was recorded in the trace list.
  Typically, any single invocation of a program does not produce a pagefault on
every page referenced by the program. Several traces may be needed to fully
identify the extent of pages used. The cumulative_page_trace (cpt) command is
useful for this purpose.
