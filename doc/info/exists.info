11/10/86 exists

Syntax as a command:
   exists argument {str_args}
   exists key star_name{s} {-control_arg{s}}


Syntax as an active function:
   [exists argument {str_args}]
   [exists key star_name{s} {-control_arg{s}}]


Function:  checks for the existence of various types of items depending
on the value of the first argument (key).


Arguments:
argument
   is the key "argument" described below in "List of Keys".
key
   is any key as described below in "List of Keys".
str_args
   are character string arguments.
star_name{s}
   are star names to be matched.  Up to 20 names can be specified.


Control arguments:
-chase
   specifies that any keyword that looks for branch entries chase links
   and look at the link targets.  When used, the link names are used
   for starname matching and the targets for type matching.
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   returns false if a star_name is an invalid name or if access to tell
   of an entry's existence is lacking.
-no_chase
   specifies that any keyword that looks for branch entries not chase
   links.  (Default)
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   signals an error if a star_name is an invalid name or if access to
   tell of an entry's existence is lacking.  (Default)



-select_entry_type STR, -slet STR
   selects entries of the types specified by STR, which is a
   comma-delimited list of file system entry types; example:  exists
   entry ** -slet ms,mbx.  This control argument is recognized when the
   key is "entry."  Use the list_entry_types command to obtain a list
   of valid entry type values.


List of keys:
argument
   true if any str_args are specified, false otherwise.
branch
   true if any branches (segments, multisegment files, or directories)
   with a pathname matching star_name exist, false otherwise.
component
   true if any archive components with a pathname matching star_name
   exist, false otherwise.  Both the archive segment name and the
   component name can be a star_name.
directory, dir
   true if any directories with a pathname matching star_name exist,
   false otherwise.


entry
   true if any entries (segments, directories, multisegment files,
   links, data management files, or extended entries) with a pathname
   matching star_name exist, false otherwise.
file
   true if any segments or multisegment files with a pathname matching
   star_name exist, false otherwise.
link
   true if any links with a pathname matching star_name exist, false
   otherwise.
master_directory, mdir
   true if any master directories with a pathname matching star_name
   exist, false otherwise.



msf
   true if any multisegment files with a pathname matching star_name
   exist, false otherwise.
nonbranch
   true if any links with a pathname matching star_name exist, false
   otherwise.
nondir
   true if any segments, multisegment files, or links with a pathname
   matching star_name exist, false otherwise.
nonfile
   true if any links or directories with a pathname matching star_name
   exist, false otherwise.
nonlink
   true if any directories, segments, or multisegment files with a
   pathname matching star_name exist, false otherwise.



nonmaster_directory, nmdir
   true if any directories which are not master directories with a
   pathname matching star_name exist, false otherwise.
nonmsf
   true if any directories, segments, or links with a pathname matching
   star_name exist, false otherwise.
non_null_link, nonnull_link, nnlink
   true if any links with a pathname matching star_name exist and point
   to an existing segment, directory, or multisegment file, false
   otherwise.


nonobject_file, nobfile
   true if nonobject files with a pathname matching starname exist;
   otherwise false.  Segments or multisegment files that the user does
   not have at least r access to are treated as nonobject files.
nonobject_msf, nobmsf
   true if nonobject multisegment files with a pathname matching
   starname exist; otherwise false.  Multisegment files that the user
   does not have at least r access to are treated as nonobject msfs.
nonobject_segment, nobseg
   true if nonobject segments with a pathname matching star_name exist;
   otherwise false.  Segments that the user does not have at least r
   access to are treated as nonobject segments.


nonsegment, nonseg
   true if any links, directories, or multisegment files with a
   pathname matching star_name exist, false otherwise.
nonzero_file, nzfile
   true if any nonzero length segments or multisegment files with a
   pathname matching star_name exist, false otherwise.
nonzero_msf, nzmsf
   true if any nonzero length multisegment files with a pathname
   matching star_name exist, false otherwise.
nonzero_segment, nzseg
   true if any nonzero length segments with pathname matching star_name
   exist, false otherwise.
null_link, nlink
   true if any links with a pathname matching star_name exist and point
   to nonexistent entries, false otherwise.



object_file, obfile
   true if object files with a pathname matching starname exist;
   otherwise false.  Segments or multisegment files that the user does
   not have at least r access to will be ignored.
object_msf, obmsf
   true if object multisegment files with a pathname matching starname
   exist; otherwise false.  Multisegment files that the user does not
   have at least r access to will be ignored.
object_segment, obseg
   true if object segments with a pathname matching star_name exist;
   otherwise false.  Segments that the user does not have at least r
   access to will be ignored.


segment, seg
   true if any segments with a pathname matching star_name exist, false
   otherwise.
zero_segment, zseg
   true if any zero length segments with a pathname matching star_name
   exist, false otherwise.
