Syntax:  .ifi subroutine_entry "declaration" "call example"
     or  .ifi subr_entry "declaration" "call example"


Function:
This macro places a subroutine entry declaration and call syntax
description on the page.


Macro action:
1) formats "declaration" and "call example" in 10pt Helvetica (also see
   Notes) at the current indentation level, with the first line of each
   hanging by one level.


Notes:
1) "declaration" and "call example" must be given as quoted strings.
2) "declaration" and "call example" may contain both literal fields and
   variable fields.	 These fields are distinguished in the output by
   presenting the variable fields in 10pt Helvetica Bold Italic instead
   of Roman.  Variable fields are denoted by enclosing them between
   tilde (~) characters.


   Example:

   .ifi subroutine_entry "declare hyphenate_word_ entry (char (**),
   .+   fixed bin, fixed bin, fixed bin (35));" "call hyphenate_word_
   .+   (~string~, ~space~, ~break~, ~code~);"

   will show "string", "space", "break", and "code" in Bold Italic with
   eveything else in Roman.
