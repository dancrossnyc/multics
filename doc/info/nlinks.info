11/12/86  null_links, nlinks

Syntax as a command:  nlinks star_names {-control_arg}


Syntax as an active function:  [nlinks star_names {-control_arg}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of links for
which the target does not exist that match one or more star names.


Arguments:
star_names
   are star names to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.


Notes:  Only one name per link is returned; i.e., if a link has more
than one name that matches star_name, only the first match if returned.

Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by null_links is enclosed
in quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single argument
regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.
