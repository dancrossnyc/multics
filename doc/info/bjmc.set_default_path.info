:Info: bj_mgr_call: bjmc: 04/05/85  bj_mgr_call, bjmc

Syntax as a command:  bjmc key {paths} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc key {paths} {-control_args}]


Function: enables you to manipulate before journals in your process by
calling before_journal_manager_ entry points from command level.  This
command is part of the command level interface to Multics data
management (DM) (see the Programmer's Reference Manual).


Arguments:
key
   designates the before journal manager operation to be performed.
   See "List of operations" below for a description of each operation,
   its command and active function syntax lines, and specific
   application.
paths
   specifies the absolute or relative pathname of the before journals
   being manipulated (required for all key operations except
   get_default_path).  Give -pathname (-pn) PATH with pathnames
   constructed with leading minus signs to distinguish them from
   control arguments.  If you supply no .bj suffix, it is assumed.


Control arguments:
   can be one or more control arguments, depending on the particular
   operation.


List of operations: Each operation is described in the general format
   of a command/active function.  Where appropriate, notes and examples
   are included for clarity.

:Info: bj_mgr_call.close: bjmc.close: bj_mgr_call.cl: bjmc.cl: 04/05/85
bjmc close operation

Syntax as a command:  bjmc cl paths


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc cl paths]


Function: closes the before journals specified by paths.  Separate
pathnames by spaces if multiple journals are to be closed.
Specifically close by name each journal opened in the process.  The
active function returns true if the journals were closed successfully,
false otherwise.


Arguments:
paths
   are the absolute or relative pathnames of before journals to be
   closed.  You can use -pathname (-pn) to specify the journal paths.
   If you supply no .bj suffix, it is assumed.


Notes: If a before journal being closed by this operation is the
default journal, the last journal opened in the process becomes the
default.


:Info: bj_mgr_call.closed: bjmc.closed: 04/05/85  bjmc closed operation

Syntax as a command:  bjmc closed path


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc closed path]


Function: returns true if the before journal specified by path is not
open in your process, false otherwise.


Arguments:
path
   is the absolute or relative pathname of a before journal.  You can
   use -pathname (-pn) to specify the journal path.  If you don't give
   the .bj suffix, it is assumed.


:Info: bj_mgr_call.create: bjmc.create: bj_mgr_call.cr: bjmc.cr
04/05/85  bjmc create operation

Syntax as a command:  bjmc cr paths {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc cr paths {-control_args}]


Function: creates the before journals specified by paths.  The active
function returns true if the journals are created successfully, false
otherwise.


Arguments:
paths
   are the absolute or relative pathnames of the before journals to be
   created.  You can use -pathname (-pn) to specify the journal path.
   If you supply no .bj suffix, it is assumed.


Control arguments:
-length N, -ln N
   specifies the size of the before journal, where N is the number of
   4096-byte control intervals.  Once established, you can't alter a
   journal's size.  (Default: if you specify no value at the time of
   creation, the size is 64 control intervals).
-transaction_storage_limit N, -tsl N
   specifies the maximum number of bytes a single transaction can use
   in the before journal (Default: the entire journal, see the
   set_attriubute operation for more info).


Notes: Before journals are extended entry types; you can delete them
using the delete command.  You can only delete before journals if they
are not required for recovery.


:Info: bj_mgr_call.gdp: bjmc.get_default_path: bjmc.gdp: 04/05/85
bjmc get_default_path operation


Syntax as a command:  bjmc gdp


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc gdp]


Function: returns the pathname of the process's default before
journal.


:Info: bj_mgr_call.open: bj_mgr_call.o: bjmc.o: 04/05/85
bjmc open operation

Syntax as a command:  bjmc o paths


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc o paths]


Function: opens the before journals specified by paths.  The active
function returns true if the journals are opened successfully, false
otherwise.


Arguments:
paths
   are the absolute or relative pathnames of before journals to be
   opened in your process.  You can use -pathname (-pn) to specify the
   journal path.  If you supply no .bj suffix, it is assumed.


Notes: If no journal has been specifically designated as the default
(see the set_default_path operation) for your process, the last before
journal opened in the process becomes the default.  If no journal is
opened in your process when a transaction is started, the system before
journal is opened and used as the default.


:Info: bj_mgr_call.opened: bjmc.opened: 04/05/85  bjmc opened operation

Syntax as a command:  bjmc opened path


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc opened path]


Function: returns true if the before journal specified by path is
opened in your process, false otherwise.


Arguments:
path
   is the absolute or relative pathname of a before journal.  You can
   use -pathname (-pn) to specify the journal path.  If you supply no
   .bj suffix, it is assumed.


:Info: bjmc.set_default_path: bjmc.sdp: 04/05/85
bjmc set_default_path operation


Syntax as a command:  bjmc sdp path


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc sdp path]


Function: sets the default before journal for the process to the
specified pathname.  The active function returns true if the pathname
is successfully set, false otherwise.


Arguments:
path
   is the absolute or relative pathname of the before journal to be
   used as the default by your process.  You can use -pathname (-pn) to
   specify the journal path.  If you supply no .bj suffix, it is
   assumed.


Notes: If no default before journal is set for your process, the last
journal opened in the process is used as the default (see the open
operation).  If no before journal is open in the process when a
transaction is started, the system before journal is opened and used as
the default.


:Info: bj_mgr_call.set_attribute: bjmc.set_attribute: bjmc.sattr: 04/05/85  bjmc
   set_attribute operation


Syntax as a command:  bjmc sattr paths -control_arg


Syntax as an active function:  [bjmc sattr paths -control_arg]


Function: sets an attribute of the before journals specified by paths.
The active function returns true if the attribute is successfully set,
false otherwise.


Arguments:
paths
   are the absolute or relative pathnames of the before journal(s) to
   have attributes set.  You can use -pathname (-pn) to specify the
   journal path.  If you supply no .bj suffix, it is assumed.


Control arguments:
-transaction_storage_limit N, -tsl N
   specifies the maximum number of bytes a single transaction can use
   in the before journals.  An attempt to write more bytes than allowed
   causes the transaction_bj_full_ condition.  A value of zero
   indicates a transaction can use an entire journal (the default at
   journal creation time).


Notes: When this operation completes, the before journal header
containing the new attributes is not guaranteed to be flushed if the
journal is active.  Any changes do take effect immediately for current
user of the journal.
