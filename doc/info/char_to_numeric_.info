:Entry: char_to_numeric_: 01/31/83  char_to_numeric_


Function: converts a user-supplied string to a numeric type, or
signals the conversion condition if it cannot be converted.  The
attributes of the numeric data created are returned.


Syntax:
declare char_to_numeric_ entry (ptr, fixed bin(35), fixed bin(35), ptr,
     fixed bin(21));
call char_to_numeric_ (target_ptr, enc_type, enc_prec, source_ptr,
     source_len);


Arguments:
target_ptr
   points to a buffer where the numeric data may be written.  No check
   is made that the buffer is large enough to hold the data.  (Input)
enc_type
   is the encoded type of the data created.  Its value is 2*M+P, where
   M is a standard Multics type code, and P is 1 if the data is packed,
   or 0 if it is not.  (P should always be 0.)  The value of Multics
   type codes are defined in the Programmer's Reference Manual.
   (Output)


enc_prec
   is the encoded precision of the data created.  The format of an
   encoded precision is given by encoded_precision.incl.pl1.  See the
   description of the assign_ subroutine.  (Output)
source_ptr
   points to the character string to convert to numeric.  (Input)
source_len
   is the number of characters in the input string.  (Input)
