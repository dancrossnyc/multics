08/14/84  secure_mrds_db, smdb

Syntax as a command:  smdb db_path {-control_args}


Function:  This command provides the ability to turn on (or off) the
attribute level security control features of MRDS.  This is done on a
data base basis.  The secured state of a data base can also be
displayed by this command.


Arguments:
db_path
   is the relative or absolute pathname of the data base to be secured,
   unsecured, or have its secured state displayed.  The data base
   suffix need not be given.  The path must be to a version 4 data
   base, not to a submodel.


Control arguments:
-display, -di
   causes the current data base secured state to be displayed without
   affecting that state.
-reset, -rs
   causes the specified data base to be unsecured, regardless of its
   current secured state.
-set
   causes the specified data base to be secured, regardless of its
   current secured state.  (Default)


Notes:  A data base that has been secured can be opened by a non-DBA,
only via a submodel residing in the "secure.submodels" directory
underneath the data base directory.  This allows turning on (or off)
attribute level security, which is implemented via submodel views,
using their access control modes (version 5 submodels).  Data bases
earlier than version 4 are not supported.

This command requires the user to be a DBA.  Once the data base has
been secured, commands that normally operate against the model view
requires the user to be a DBA.  In addition, once the data base has
been secured, commands using a submodel view require non-DBAs to use
secured submodels.
