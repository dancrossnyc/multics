:Entry: link_unsnap_: 02/07/84  link_unsnap_

Function: restores snapped links pointing to a given segment or its
linkage section.  Such links then appear as if they had never been
snapped (changed into ITS pairs).  This is accomplished by
sequentially indexing through the Linkage Offset Table (LOT) and for
each linkage section listed there by searching for links to be
restored.


Syntax:
declare link_unsnap_ entry (ptr, ptr, ptr, fixed bin(17),
     fixed bin(17));
call link_unsnap_ (lot_ptr, isot_ptr, linkage_ptr, hcsc, high_seg);


Arguments:
lot_ptr
   is a pointer to the LOT.  (Input)
isot_ptr
   is a printer to the ISOT.  (Input)
linkage_ptr
   is a pointer to the linkage section to be discarded.  (Input)
hscs
   is one less than the segment number of the first segment that can be
   unsnapped.  (Input)
high_seg
   is the number of LOT slots used in searching for links to be
   restored.  (Input)
