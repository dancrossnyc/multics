10/17/84  stop_cobol_run, scr

Syntax as a command:  scr {-control_arg}


Function: terminates the current COBOL run unit.


Control arguments:
-retain_data, -retd
   leaves the data segments associated with the programs of the run
   unit intact for debugging purposes (see "Notes").


Notes: The results of stop_cobol_run and the execution of the STOP RUN
statement from within a COBOL program are identical.  Stopping the run
unit consists of cleaning up all files that have been opened during the
execution of the current run unit and ensuring that the next time a
program that was a component of this run unit is invoked its data is in
its initial state.

To maintain the value of all data referenced in the run unit in its
last used state, use -retain_data.

Refer to the run_cobol command for information concerning the run unit
and the COBOL runtime environment.  See also the cancel_cobol_program
and display_cobol_run_unit commands.
