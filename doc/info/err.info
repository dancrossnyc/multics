01/17/86  enter_retrieval_request, err

Syntax as a command:  err path {-control_args}


Function:  queues volume retrieval requests for specific segments,
directories, multisegment files (MSFs), and subtrees.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment, directory, or node of a subtree.  The
   star convention is not allowed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   supresses printing of the ID and number of requests in queue.
-from DT, -fm DT
   specifies that the search for path and all inferior branches, if
   supplied, stops at time DT; thus, objects dumped before time DT are
   not recovered.  (See time_strings.gi for a description of valid DT
   values.)  If you give no -from, all valid dump volumes are searched.
-long_id
   prints the long ID of the request.  (Default: to print the short
   ID)
-multisegment_file, -msf
   specifies that the object named in path is a MSF and that all its
   components are to be recovered.


-new_path newpath
   specifies that if you have the correct access to retrieve the
   segment specified in path and to create a segment with the pathname
   newpath, then the object identified by path is retrieved into
   newpath.  You can't cross-retrieve directories, MSFs, or subtrees.
-notify, -nt
   notifies you by online mail of the success or failure of the
   request.  (Default: not to notify you)
-previous, -prev
   retrieves the object dumped prior to the object presently online.
   With -previous you can retrieve successively earlier copies of an
   object.  (Default: to retrieve the most recent copy)
-queue N, -q N
   queues requests in priority queue N.  (Default: 3)


-subtree, -subt
   retrieves the subtree inferior to the directory given in path as
   well as the directory.  If a subtree is found intact after a
   directory is recovered, then no further action is taken, unless you
   have provided a time interval (see "Notes").  (Default: not to
   retrieve subtrees)
-to DT
   searches for path and all inferior branches from time DT backwards;
   thus, objects dumped later than time DT are not recovered.  (See
   time_strings.gi for a description of valid DT values.)  If you don't
   select -to, time DT is assumed to be the start of the retrieval
   operation.


Access required: To retrieve a segment, you need w access to the
segment or m access to the containing directory; to retrieve a
directory, you need m access to the directory or m access to the
containing directory.


Notes: In certain cases where a directory is damaged the inferior
subtree may be unavailable until the directory is recovered.  When a
directory is recovered and -subtree is used, a check is made to see if
the subtree is available, and, if so, retrieval is assumed complete.

Retrieval requests of objects for which the online copy is more recent
or the same as the dump copy are refused, unless you use -previous,
-from, or -to.

You need not supply as a set of primary names the pathnames of the
segments and directories to be retrieved.  Any set of valid entrynames
is acceptable.

You have to log in to ring 1 to submit retrieval requests for mailboxes
and other ring 1 objects.
