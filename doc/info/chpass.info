02/06/84  chpass

Syntax:  chpass Person_id


Function: allows the accounting administrator to change the password
for a single user.  It changes the user's password in the PNT found in
>sc1.  Thus, even if the user has changed his password with the
-change_password control argument to the login command, the chpass
command overrides the user's change.


Arguments:
Person_id
   is the Person_id of the user whose password is to be changed.


Notes:  A password consists of from one through eight ASCII
printing characters including backspace, but excluding space
and semicolon.

"HELP", "help", "quit", and "?"  are interpreted uniquely by the
password processor and are therefore unacceptable as password
specifications for an interactive login.  Entering "quit" terminates
the login attempt, while "HELP", "help", or "?"  results in an
explanatory message and repeat of the password prompt.
