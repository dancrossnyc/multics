02/08/84  eis_tester, et

Syntax:  et path {-control_args}


Function:  sets up and tests EIS instructions in a controlled
environment.  You must prepare an input script describing the EIS
instructions to be tested.  From this input script the EIS tester
builds the EIS instructions (one at a time) and the indirect words,
descriptors, and data that each instruction needs.  The instruction to
be tested is set up in a special ALM segment (etx).  The eis_tester
command calls etx in order to execute the EIS instruction; etx returns
to eis_tester when the instruction has been executed.  After executing
the instruction, eis_tester tests correct execution of the instruction.
If one of the test scripts in the ets data base fails and the
successful execution of that test is dependent upon installation of a
particular FCO, the FCO number is displayed in the error message.

See the Multics System Diagnostic Aids manual (AR97) for details on the
operation of the EIS tester and on how to write script input tests.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a segment that contains input script data that
   defines the instructions to test.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses all output except identification and error messages.
-nox
   sets up the instruction but does not execute it; used to test the
   validity of the input script.
-debug
   runs the test in a debugging loop where each instruction is tested
   10 times but results from the test are not checked.  Each time
   through the loop the instruction is set up completely, including all
   the specified faults.
-select N, -sel N, -do N
   processes only test N (where N is a positive decimal number).  This
   number has no relationship to the -ns field in any test.


-help
   displays a brief usage statement.
-instruction_type INSTR, -inst INSTR
   processes only tests that contain the instruction INSTR.
-long, -lg
   displays all the related test information prior to executing a test.
-repeat N, -rpt N
   repeats the entire execution of the selected tests N times.
-stop_on_failure, -sof
   displays the failing data, machine condition, and history register
   information and return to command level if an error is detected in a
   test.  The default is to display the failing data and continue with
   the next test.


-from N, -fm N
   starts processing test N (where N is a positive decimal number) and
   continues processing all remaining tests in the input segment unless
   -to is used.
-to N
   stops processing after test N (where N is a positive decimal
   number).  If -from is not used, tests one through N are processed.


Notes:  The eis_tester program prints a message noting the beginning of
each instruction test.  It also prints the number of this test.  If
there are errors, it prints the incorrect data or incorrect
indicators.

If you do not specify -brief, then the data that eis_tester has set up
for this instruction is printed before the instruction is executed.


The eis_tester program is the main procedure in the EIS instruction
tester.  It calls et_test to parse the statements in your data file.
It translates these statements into the data needed to build and test
an EIS instruction in the external segment etx.  After building the
instruction, this procedure calls etx in order to execute the EIS
instruction.  When etx returns, the results of the EIS instruction are
examined.  The eis_tester program continues to build and test EIS
instructions until there is no data left in the input file.  The
failure of one instruction only causes the termination of that one
instruction test.  Any remaining instructions specified in the input
file are processed and tested.
