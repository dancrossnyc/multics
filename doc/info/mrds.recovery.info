Function:	 This is a description of the procedure for backing up mrds databases
and then recovering to that earlier state of the database.


Procedure:  To obtain the backup copy of the database, do a quiesce_mrds_db on
the current database, then do a copy_dir of the database directory into another
part of the storage hierarchy, and finally do quiesce_mrds_db with the -free
option on the original database.


To return to the earlier state of the database that has been backed up, do a
quiesce_mrds_db of the current database, delete that database with a
delete_dir, do a copy_dir of the backup copy into the original storage
location, then finally do a quiesce_mrds_db with the -free option on the new
current database.


Notes:  The quiescing process is the only process that can open or update the
backup copy of the database.

The backup copy can be freed from the quiescent state if it is to be used for
program development, rather than a static backup copy.

A database quiesced by a dead process needs both a quiesce_mrds_db path -free,
an adjust_mrds_db path -trouble_switch off done to it.  However, there is
danger of an inconsistent database.

If display_mrds_db_status shows many open users, a long wait time may be needed
for quiesce_mrds_db.  However, a short wait time will work as a go/no_go test.
Also, dmdbs will show if the database is in a quiescent state.
