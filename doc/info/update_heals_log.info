02/17/84  update_heals_log

Syntax:  update_heals_log


Function:  copies messages of interest to HEALS from the syserr log
file into the HEALS log.  The messages copied are those new messages
added to the syserr log since the last invocation of this command by
any process.


Notes:  In order to update the log, the directory
>system_control_1>heals_dir must already exist and you must have access
to system files as follows:

     re to audit_gate and to phcs_
     r  to system_control_1>perm_syserr_log
     rw to system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log
     rw to system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log_info

If either the segment >system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log or the
segment >system_control_1>heals_dir>heals_log_info does not exist, it
is created; in this case, you need sma access on
>system_control_1>heals_dir.  The heals_log_info segment contains
information about the current heals_log segment.
