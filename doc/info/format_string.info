02/05/85  format_string, fstr

Syntax as a command:  fstr {-control_args} text


Syntax as an active function:  [fstr {-control_args} text]


Function: uses format_document_$string to fill and optionally adjust a
text string.  As a command, it prints the filled and adjusted text; as
an active function, it requotes the return value.


Arguments:
text
   is the text strings to be filled.  If you give more than one, they
   are concatenated, separated by a space.  All arguments that do not
   begin with a minus and are not an operand of a preceding control
   argument are treated as text strings, and so are all arguments
   following the first text string encountered, whether or not they
   begin with a minus.


Control arguments:
-adjust, -adj
   left- and right-justifies text.
-break_word
   to prevent line length from being exceeded, arbitrarily breaks into
   two or more parts words that are longer than the current line length
   and that cannot be hyphenated (when you use -hyphenate).  (Default)
-column N, -col N
   formats text as if N-1 characters already appeared on the first
   line.  The output begins at column N.  (Default: 1)
-hyphenate {N}, -hph {N}
   changes the default hyphenation mode from OFF to ON.  The optional
   parameter N is the length of the smallest separated word part; its
   default value is 2.


-indent N, -ind N
   indents output N spaces from the left margin.  (Default: 0)
-line_length N, -ll N
   sets the line length to N characters.  (Default: 65)
-no_adjust, -nadj
   turns off justification.  (Default)
-no_break_word
   does not brake words longer than the line length; instead, it
   returns a line longer than the given line length.
-no_hyphenate, -nhph
   turns off hyphenation.  (Default)


-string text, -str text
   treats all remaining arguments as part of the text to be formatted.
-undent N, -und N
   undents the first line by N characters.  If N is negative, the first
   line is indented (with respect to the -indent value) by N
   characters.
