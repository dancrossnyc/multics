08/14/84  display_mrds_temp_dir, dmtd

Syntax as a command:  dmtd temp_dir_indicator


Function:  This command displays the directory under which temporary
storage for a given data base opening is placed.  This storage includes
the "resultant model" that is created at open time for allowing access
to the data base, storage for temporary relations, and intermediate
results of complex searches.  The default is the process directory.


Arguments:
   where temp_dir_indicator must be one of the following:
database_index
   the opening index returned by the dsl_$open subroutine.  If this
   option is used, then the temporary directory pathname for that
   particular opening is displayed.
-current, -cur
   displays the current temporary directory pathname that is used in
   subsequent calls to open.


Notes:  To change from the default the command set_mrds_temp_dir is
used to allow for the opening of a data base with a very large
resultant model that does not fit in the process directory, for a data
base with a large number of temporary relations, or for searches
involving many tuples in several relations.  This would be the case if
a record quota overflow occurred in the process directory on a call to
open.

See dsl_$get_temp_dir for a subroutine interface.
