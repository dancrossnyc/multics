Syntax as a command:  pm msg_specs {mbx_specification} {-control_args}


Function:  prints any interprocess messages that were received (and
saved in the user's mailbox) while the user was not accepting messages,
not logged in, or "accept_messages -hold_messages" was in effect.


Arguments:
msg_specs
   are one or more numbers or ranges.  Numbers are as printed next to
   each message when accept_messages -hold_messages is in effect.
   Ranges are of the form N:M, where N<=M and both N and M are valid
   message numbers.  You can use the keywords "first" (f) and "last"
   (l) as message numbers and the keyword "all" (a) as a range
   (equivalent to "f:l").
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox from which messages are to be printed.  If not
   given, the user's default mailbox (>udd>Project>Person>Person.mbx)
   is used.


Control arguments:
-after DATE_TIME
   prints messages sent after DATE_TIME only.
-all, -a
   prints all messages, including those held by the -hold_messages mode
   (see accept_messages).  (Default)
-before DATE_TIME
   prints messages sent before DATE_TIME only.
-brief, -bf
   suppresses an error message when no matching messages are found.


-call cmdline
   calls the command processor with a string of the form:

         cmdline number sender time message {path}

   where:
   cmdline
      is any Multics command line; enclose it in quotes if it contains
      blanks or other command language characters.
   number
      is the sequence number of the message, assigned when you use
      -hold; otherwise it is 0.
   sender
      is the User_id of the person who sent the message.


   time
      is the date-time the message was sent.
   message
      is the message sent.
   path
      is the pathname of the mailbox to which the message was sent.  If
      the message was sent to the default mailbox, path is omitted.
   -comment STR, -com STR
      prints messages with comment fields containing STR only.
   -exclude STR
      prints messages with text not containing STR only.
   -from STR, -fm STR
      prints messages sent from STR only.  STR can be of the form
      Person.Project, Person, or .Project.


   -last, -lt
      prints only the latest message received.  You can't use it with
      any other message selection arguments.
   -long, -lg
      prints the sender and date-time of every message, even when the
      same for two consecutive messages.  It overrides -brief.
   -match STR
      prints messages with text containing STR only.
   -messages, -msg
      prints regular messages (nonnotifications) only.
   -no_messages, -nmsg
      suppresses -messages.
   -no_notifications, -nnt
      nullifies -notifications.


   -notifications, -nt
      deletes notifications only.
   -new
      when accept_messages -hold is in effect, prints only those
      messages that have not been printed before.  (Default:  to print
      all held messages)
   -short, -sh
      precedes consecutive messages from the same sender by "=" instead
      of the Person_id and Project_id, and does not print the date-time
      string, but only if less than five minutes have passed since the
      previous message.  It omits the date if the current message and
      the previous one are received on the same date.  (Default)


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to

         -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx

-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.
-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.


Notes:  A default mailbox is created the first time you issue
print_mail, read_mail, or accept_messages.  The default mailbox is:

      >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx

Messages are deleted after they are printed unless accept_messages
-hold_messages is in effect); however, the last message remains
available for the life of the process or until replaced by a new
message.  (See also last_message, last_message_sender, and
last_message_time.)

If you are deferring messages, it is a good practice to use the
print_messages command periodically to print out pending messages.
