02/25/85  spg_util_


The spg_util_ subroutine collects metering information from the Multics
supervisor and subtracts it from the previous sample taken.  It is
normally called by the system_performance_graph command.  To use this
subroutine, access to either the phcs_ or the metering_gate_ gate is
required.

:Entry:   spg_util_:  02/25/85  spg_util_


Function:
collects metering information from the Multics supervisor and 
subtracts it from the previous sample taken.


Syntax:
declare spg_util_$spg_util_ (float, float, float, float, float, float,
     float, float, float, char(110), fixed bin, fixed bin)
call spg_util_$spg_util_ (pzi, pnmpi, pmpi, pint, ptc, ppf, psf,
     puse_rz, px, string, length, chsw)


Arguments:
pzi
   is the percentage of zero idle time.  (Output)
pnmpi
   is the percentage of nonmultiprogramming idle time.  (Output)
pmpi
   is the percentage of multiprogramming idle time.  (Output)
pint
   is the percentage of time in interrupts.  (Output)
ptc
   is the percentage of time in the traffic controller.  (Output)
ppf
   is the percentage of time in page control.  (Output)
psf
   is the percentage of time in segment control.  (Output)


puse_rz
   is the percentage of time executing nonsupervisor code spent in ring
   zero.  (Output)
px
   is no longer used.  A value of 0.0 is returned.  (Output)
string
   if the variable chsw is nonzero, string contains upon output a
   character string that describes a new configuration or a new setting
   of the scheduler tuning parameters.  (Output)
length
   is the length of the character string "string".  (Output)
chsw
   is a switch that, if zero, indicates normal output; if nonzero, it
   indicates that string and length are valid and should be output.
   (Output)


:Entry:  reset:  02/25/85 spg_util_$reset


Function:  The effect of this call is to reset the internal
initialization switch of the subroutine.


Syntax:
declare spg_util_$reset entry;
call spg_util_$reset;


Arguments:
   There are no arguments.
