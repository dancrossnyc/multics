10/20/86 display_list, dils

Syntax as a command:  dils path {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [dils path {-control_args}]


Function:  displays selected portions of selected lister records.  As
an active function, returns selected portions of selected lister
records.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the lister file.  The suffix lister must be the
   last component of the lister segment name; however, if path does not
   have a suffix of lister, one is assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief_errors, -bfe
   suppresses the warning when no records match the selection
   expression.
-field_name field_names, -fn field_names
   causes the specified field to be displayed or returned, in the order
   indicated.  This control argument must be given.
-select STR, -sel STR
   specifies those records whose fields are to be displayed.  If this
   control argument is not specified, then all records are used.


-sort STR, -st STR
   sorts the records processed according to string, which is a string
   enclosed in quotes.  The new ordering of the list is in effect only
   for the duration of the command.  The lister file is not modified.
   If this control argument is not specified, then records are
   processed in the order in which they currently appear in the lister
   file.


Notes:  The display_list command sets the "lister" severity indicator.
A severity of 2 is set when the display is not performed for some
reason other than no records matching the selection expression, or the
invocation of display_list terminates abnormally.  A severity of 1 is
set when the selection expression finds no match.  A severity of 0 is
set when the display is successfully completed and the command
terminates normally.
