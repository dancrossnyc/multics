09/18/85  check_file_system_damage, cfsd

Syntax as a command:  cfsd {path} {-control_args}


Function: finds damaged segments and connection failures.


Arguments:
path
   is a pathname specifying what is to be checked.  It can be a star
   name, an absolute or relative pathname, or -working_dir (-wd).  If
   you provide -subtree, path cannot be a star name (i.e., it must be a
   directory). If this argument is not given, then the -pathname
   control argument must be specified.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses error messages about incorrect access to directories and
   no star name matches.  (Default: to print these messages)
-call STR
   executes "STR path damaged" for each damaged segment and "STR path
   connection_failure" for each connection failure.  STR is a command
   to be executed for each damaged segment.  The default when you don't
   give -call is to print an error message for each damaged segment and
   each connection failure.
-depth N, -dh N
   looks only N directories down; if you supply it, -subtree is
   implied.  (Default: to search downwards in all directories that are
   eligible for searching)


-no_multisegment_file, -no_msf
   does not check components of MSFs.
-multisegment_file, -msf
   checks components of MSFs.  (Default)
-pathname path, -pn path
   specifies that the next argument is to be used as a pathname, rather
   than as a control argument.
-subtree, -subt
   checks all segments in, and all directories below, the specified
   directory.
