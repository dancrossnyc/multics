08/19/88  list_daemon_requests, ldr

Syntax as a command:  ldr {path} {-control_args}


Function: lists requests in the I/O daemon queues.  The request
identifier and entryname of each request are printed.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a request to be listed.  The star convention is
   allowed.  Only requests matching this pathname are selected.  If you
   give no path, all pathnames are selected.  This argument is
   incompatible with -entry.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   prints the full pathname of each selected request, rather than the
   just entryname.
-admin {User_id}, -am {User_id}
   selects the requests of all users, or of the user specified by
   User_id.  If you don't choose -admin, only your own requests are
   selected.  This control argument is incompatible with -user.  (See
   "Access required" and "Notes" below.)
-all, -a
   searches all queues and prints the totals for each nonempty queue
   whether or not any requests are selected from it.  If you supply no
   -all, the default queue is searched.  This control argument is
   incompatible with -queue.


-brief, -bf
   does not print the state and comment of each request.  This control
   argument is incompatible with -long and -total.
-entry STR, -et STR
   selects only requests whose entrynames match STR.  The star
   convention is allowed.  Directory portions of request pathnames are
   ignored when selecting requests.
-id ID
   selects only requests whose identifier matches the specified ID.
-immediate, -im
   selects only requests that can be run immediately and skips requests
   deferred by the I/O daemon.


-long, -lg
   prints all the information about each selected request including the
   long request identifier and the full pathname.  If you omit -long,
   only the short request identifier, entryname, and state are printed.
-long_id, -lgid
   prints the long the request identifier.
-position, -psn
   prints the position within its queue of each selected request.  When
   used with -total, it prints a list of all the positions of the
   selected requests.  (See "Access required" and "Notes.")
-queue N, -q N
   searches only queue N.  If you don't select -queue, all queues are
   searched but nothing is printed for queues from which no requests
   are selected.


-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   specifies that requests are to be found in the queue for the request
   type identified by STR.  If you give no -request_type, the default
   is "printer".  List request types with print_request_types.
-total, -tt
   prints only the total number of selected requests and the total
   number of requests in the queue plus a list of positions if you
   choose -position.  If the queue is empty, it is not listed.
-user User_id
   selects only requests entered by the specified user.  (See "Access
   required" and Notes.")


Access required: You must have o access to the queue(s).  You must
have r extended access to the queue(s) to use -admin, -position, or
-user, since it is necessary to read all requests in the queue(s) to
select those entered by a specified user or to compute the positions of
the chosen requests.


Notes: The User_id arguments specified after -admin or -user can have
any of the following forms:
   Person_id.Project_id   matches that user only
   Person_id.*            matches that person on any project
   Person_id              same as Person_id.*
   *.Project_id           matches any user on that project
   .Project_id            same as *.Project_id
   *.*                    same as -admin with no User_id following it.

If -admin User_id or -user User_id is given more than once in a
command, only the final instance is used.


The state is printed only if it is deferred and you don't supply
-brief.
