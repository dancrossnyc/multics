Description

2  phx20125
any_to_any_ invalidly permits certain characters to escape detection in
conversion of characters to a numeric form through the char_to_numeric_
entry point (through assign_, any_to_any_ and some other paths).

This occurs because the valid character detection occurs after the
incoming string has been rtrimmed.  The table used by the tctr, which
does the rtrim, is short and suitable for use only if characters exist
within the valid span of characters for numeric entry.  The problem
reported occurs when a character falls outside this range and hits a 0
byte within a following table, thus looking like a blank and getting
trimmed, rather than detected.

When this occurs the incoming string appears to be null and is then
co-erced to appear to be 0.  This error does not occur in the
char-to-bit conversion, since this is done in a separate portion of
any_to_any_.

1  phx19826
Any_to_any_, called either through assign_ or as an operator call
direct from pl1_operators_ causes an IPR fault in conversion of a
+000..000 fixed decimal value to a scaled fixed binary or scaled fixed
binary unsigned value.  This occurs since the special case of 0, with a
large precision, skips around code to correctly set the length of the
string (into x4).
