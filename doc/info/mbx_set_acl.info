10/17/84  mbx_set_acl, mbsa

Syntax as a command:
   mbsa path mode1 User_id1...modeN {User_idN} {-control_args}


Function:  manipulates the access control lists (ACLs) of mailboxes.
(For a description of ACLs, see the Programmer's Reference Manual.)


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of a mailbox; the mbx suffix is assumed.  The star
   convention is allowed.
modei
   is an extended access mode consisting of any or all the letters
   adrosw or null access (n, null, "").
User_idi
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   ACL entries with matching names are assigned modeN.  If no match is
   found and you supply all three components, an entry for User_idN is
   added to the ACL.  If you omit the last User_id, your Person_id and
   Project_id are assumed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "No match for User_id on ACL of <path>",
   where User_id omits components.
-chase
   chases links when using the star convention.  Links are always
   chased when path is not a star name.
-no_chase
   does not chase links when using the star convention.  (Default)
-no_sysdaemon, -nsd
   suppresses the addition of a "rw *.SysDaemon.*" term when using
   -replace.


-replace, -rp
   deletes all ACL terms (with the exception of the default
   *.SysDaemon.* term unless you supplied -no_sysdaemon) before adding
   the terms specified on the command line.  The default is to add to
   and modify the existing ACL.
-sysdaemon, -sd
   adds, with -replace, a "rw *.SysDaemon.*" ACL term before adding the
   terms specified on the command line.


Access required:  You need modify permission on the parent directory.
