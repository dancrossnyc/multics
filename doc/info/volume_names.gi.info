02/22/80  Volume naming conventions

     The MR8.0 RCP Resource Management package enforces slightly different con-
ventions in the naming of volumes.  The most visible differences will be appar-
ent to some users of tape volumes.


     Under previous releases, there was a loosely-defined correspondence be-
tween the "name" of a volume and its "slot number".  The slot number specified
a location from which the operator could find the desired volume.  The name of
a volume was specified by what appeared on the internal magnetic label, if any.
In the majority of cases, where these are identical, operations on these vol-
umes will continue to be performed exactly as before.  However, the manner in
which a user requests a volume will most likely change for all volumes that:
1) Contain a "volume identifier" on an internal magnetic label, that differs
significantly from the slot number; or
2) Have been habitually requested under a generic name encompassing an informal
class of physical volumes, e.g., "plotter", "dump", and so on.


Magnetic label/slot mismatch:
     Under Resource Management, the name of a volume is now defined by its slot
number, which is a unique, per-site quantity.  Users of tapes whose magnetic
label contains a "volume identifier" that differs from the slot number (now
also the name) may be accustomed, due to site policy, to requesting these de-
vices by volume identifier, optionally identifying the real slot number as a
comment to the operator; e.g.,
     Smith1 -comment "slot 000123"
or
     Smith1,*slot_000123
Users requesting these tapes under Resource Management must now request these
tapes by slot number.  Discrepancies between the magnetic label and the
user-requested name will be handled by operator volume-authentication proce-
dures and user-ring I/O modules.


Generic names:
     Resource Management allows only one generic name: "scratch".  The comment
facility of the I/O module in use may be used to cause the same effect as a re-
quest via generic name, e.g.:
     scratch,*plotter
or
     scratch -comment plotter
In addition, system tape I/O modules have been modified to display to the user
the actual name of the tape in use when a scratch volume is mounted.


I/O Module modification:
     For tape volumes, the tape_ibm_ and tape_ansi_ I/O modules have been modi-
fied to provide greater leniency in cases where the volume identifier recorded
on the VOL1 label does not match the user-supplied volume name.  Formerly,
these modules would refuse to operate on such tapes.  With MR8.0, the user will
now be queried as to whether the attachment should proceed as requested.
