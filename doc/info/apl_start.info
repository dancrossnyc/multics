Syntax:  apl_start {-control_args}


Function:	 Attaches APL I/O module so that all terminal I/O undergoes APL
translations.


Control arguments:
-terminal_type ID, -ttp ID
   sets terminal type to ID. Possible types are 1050, 2741, CORR2741, ARDS,
   TN300, TEK4013, TEK4015, 1030, TYPEPAIRED, BITPAIRED, ASCII, TELERAY11,
   LA36, SARA, AJ510, AJ830, AJ832.  The following terminals default to the
   correct table, if the type of the login terminal is set correctly:	 1050,
   2741, CORR2741, ARDS, TN300, TEK4013, TEK4015, TELERAY11, LA36, SARA, AJ510,
   AJ830, AJ832.  Multics terminal types that are not recognized by APL default
   to the ASCII table.  The following terminals are automatically switched into
   and out of APL mode:  TEK4013, TEK4015, TELERAY11, AJ510.  A 2741 is an EBCD
   2741.	A CORR2741 is a Correspondence 2741.  TYPEPAIRED is a generic
   terminal type for all typewriter-paired APL/ASCII terminals.  BITPAIRED is a
   generic terminal type for all bit-paired APL/ASCII terminals.


Notes:  This command is useful when preparing exec_com or absentee input
scripts that contain APL characters. It "turns on" the APL translations so that
the proper codes will be stored in the script for use by APL.
