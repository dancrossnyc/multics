07/30/86  Absolute pathnames (general information)

An absolute pathname is the entryname of a directory, file or link
preceded by a series of directory names beginning at the root and
leading to the final entryname.  Each directory name and the final
entryname are preceded by a greater-than character (">").


An absolute pathname always begins with a greater-than character.  This
designates the root directory.  The pathname of the root directory is
the only absolute pathname with no entryname.


Notes: See pathname.gi.info for more information on pathnames.


Examples:
   >                  (the root)
   >tools
   >udd>Demo>JQUser>myfile
