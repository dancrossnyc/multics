02/08/85  date_time_interval, dti

Syntax as a command:  dti {time_string1} time_string2 {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
   [dti {time_string1} time_string2 {-control_args}]


Function: returns the difference between two date values, relative to
the first, in offset terms: "0 yr 0 mo -2 da -6 hr 0 min -4.64 sec".
You are able to specify that the result be only in terms of certain
units.


Arguments:
time_string1
   is the beginning of the interval.  If not specified, the current
   time is used (see "Notes").
time_string2
   is the end of the interval.  If the end is earlier than the
   beginning, all numbers are preceeded by a minus sign (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   specifies that the units displayed are in the abbreviated form
   (Default).
-fractional_digits {N}, -fd {N}
   specifies the maximum number of fractional digits to be included on
   the smallest unit.  The value being formatted is rounded to the
   number of digits specified.  All trailing zeros are removed and then
   the decimal point if it is last.  N can't exceed 20.  If you supply
   no N, the maximum is used.  (Default: 2)
-zero_units, -zu
   specifies that all units are output even if their value is zero
   (e.g., "2 da 0 hr 0 min 4.2 sec".


-language STR, -lang STR
   STR specifies the language in which the result is to be expressed.
   This can be in any of the languages known to the date/time system.
   If STR is "system_lang", the system default is used.  If you choose
   no -language or it is present with STR being "", the per-process
   default is used.  Use the display_time_info command to obtain a list
   of acceptable language values.
-long, -lg
   specifies that the units displayed are in the singular/plural form.
-no_zero_units, -nzu
   specifies that any unit that has a value of zero are not included in
   the output; however if all units are zero, the smallest is shown
   with the value of "0".  Example: "2 da 4.2 sec".  (Default)


-units STRs
   specifies that the result is to be expressed in terms of a given set
   of units.  All arguments following -units on the command line are
   taken as the set of units to use; therefore make -units, if given,
   the last control argument.  You can enter the units in any language
   available on the site and in any order.  All units, however, must be
   in the same language.  These are the units that you can specify:
   year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.  The
   output appears in that order.


Notes: When you specify no units, this set is used--years, months,
days, hours, minutes, seconds.  A default result could look like this:
"-2 da -6 hr -4.05 sec"; but if the arguments given were: -fd -units
hr min, the same interval could be: -54 hr -0.0676252166666666666 min.
Note that there is a truncation in the first instance to two decimal
places with the corresponding loss of accuracy.

See time_strings.gi for a description of valid time_string values.
