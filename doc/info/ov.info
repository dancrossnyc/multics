02/18/85  overlay, ov

Syntax as a command:  ov paths {-control_args}


Function: reads several ASCII segments and writes the result of
superimposing print positions from each segment on the user_output I/O
switch output.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of input segments.  The archive convention is
   allowed.


Control arguments:
-indent N, -ind N
   indents the print positions of an input segment N columns on output.
   It only affects the path immediately preceding it.  If you don't
   give it, an indent of 0 is used.
-page_length N, -pl N
   sets the page length of the output.  If you don't supply it, a page
   length of 60 is used.


Notes: Because the overlay command uses the printer conversion
programs, control characters are removed from input files except for
newline (NL), backspace (BS), vertical tab (VT), and formfeed (FF).

If identical print positions containing the same characters are
superimposed, a boldface type results.  By following input segments
with -indent, you create output containing columns of text.
