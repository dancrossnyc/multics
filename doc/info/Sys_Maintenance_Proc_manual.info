03/17/89       Errata Information for MR12.2


Section 6, Page 6-2; add the following note in
the section titled "Cold Booting BCE" after the
sentence which states "Proceed as if you were doing a regular
boot."

     If default_rpv_data is defined on the boot tape,
     you will receive a prompt of the form "Find_rpv_subsystem:
     Default RPV data is ...    Is this
     correct?".  You must answer "no" to be able to input
     the "cold" rpv information.


Section 15: The documentation for the iod_tables_compiler will be
changed as follows:


Page 15-8; add the following information before
the section titled "Substatements for Request Types"


     DEVICE DEFINITION VARIABLES

     The following keywords are allowed in the definition of a
     device.  They will apply to all current device definitions,
     but the defaults have been chosen to avoid any changes to
     current tables.

     comment:  <string>;
        defines a comment of up to 128 characters which may be
        used to describe the device definition.  It must be a
        quoted string.  The default is a null string.

     head_sheet:  <module name>;
        defines the name of a module to be used to produce the
        front banner page on each listing.  The name given is a
        virtual pathname.  The default is the system program
        "head_sheet_".

     tail_sheet:  <module name>;
        defines the name of a module to be used to produce the
        trailing banner page on each listing.  The name given is
        a virtual pathname.  The default is the system program
        "tail_sheet_".

     paper_type:  single | continuous;
        defines whether the output paper is single sheet or
        continuous forms.  The default is "continuous".


     forms_validation:  <name>;
        defines the name of the module to be used to validate and
        generate information for the given forms option.  The
        name given is a virtual pathname.  If forms_validation is
        not given, iod_forms_$validate is called.

     forms_info:  <name>;
        defines a Forms_table entry name to be used for forms
        validation & evaluation.  If this entry is defined, the
        default_form entry must also be given.

     default_form:  <name>;
        defines a default forms string for the device to be used
        for the -forms option if the user did not provide one.
        If this entry is defined, the forms_info entry must also
        be given, since that defines how to interpret the
        default_form definition.

     font_dir:  <name>;
        defines the directory containing downloadable fonts.  The
        default is a null string.


Page 15-32; add the following after the section titled "Syntax
for the Request Type Info Source Segment"


     REQUEST_TYPE DEFINITION VARIABLES

     The following keywords are allowed in the definition of a
     request type.  They will apply to all current definitions.

     comment:  <string>;
        defines a comment of up to 128 characters which may be
        used to describe the request type.  It must be a quoted
        string.  The default is a null string.

     forms_validation:  <name>;
        defines the name of the module to be used to validate and
        generate information for the given forms option.  The
        name given is a virtual pathname.  If not given,
        iod_forms_$validate is called.

     forms_info:  <name>;
        defines a Forms_table entry name to be used for forms
        validation & evaluation.  If this entry is defined, the
        default_form entry must also be given.

     default_form:  <name>;
        defines a default forms string for the request type to be
        used for the -forms option if the user did not provide
        one.  If this entry is defined, the forms_info entry must
        also be given since that defines how to interpret the
        default_form definition.


     font_dir:  <name>;
        defines directory containing downloadable fonts.  The
        default is a null string.


     NOTE

     Since the definitions for forms_validation, forms_info,
     default_form and font_dir may be in both the Device and
     Request_type definitions, a conflict may result.  If there
     is a conflict, it is resolved in favor of the Device values.

     If we had a Request_type queue which was being serviced by
     both an Apple LaserWriter device and a Bull laser printer
     device, each would have to use their own special control
     strings to service their own unique device.

     The default_form value only takes effect when the user has
     not supplied any forms option.  A situation where this might
     have an effect is if the system printer queue, which takes
     no forms options, were to be serviced by a device defined as
     a laser printer.  The laser printer defaults to a portrait
     mode when turned on.  The default_form option for the device
     could convert the device into a landscape mode.


Page 15-6; add to the section titled "Substatements for Lines".

     The following keyword is allowed in the definition of a
     communications line.  It will apply to all current line
     definitions.

     comment:  <string>;
        defines a comment of up to 128 characters which may be
        used to describe the communications line definition.  It
        must be a quoted string.  The default is a null string.


Page 15-6; add to the section titled "Statements"

     The following is a major statement which may appear anywhere
     within the source file.  It is terminated by a Line, Device,
     Request_type or another Forms_table keyword.  The
     Forms_table defines the forms options allowed by the
     referencing Device or Request_type entry.

     Forms_table:  <name>;
        defines the name of a table containing definitions of
        various forms options.  Any subsequent substatements
        apply to this specific forms table until the next Line,
        Device, Request_type or Forms_table statement is
        encountered.  Any <name> may be chosen; it can be a
        maximum of 32 characters and cannot contain periods or


        spaces.  This is the name which is referenced by the
        forms_info keyword in the Request_type definition.

     The following substatements for the Forms_table statement
     describe the various attributes of forms information.

     name:  <name>[,<name>...,<name>];
        defines the name of a given forms option.  If more than
        one name is given, the subsequent names are synonyms for
        the first.  All statements following this entry apply to
        this entry until the next name substatement or the next
        Line, Device, Request_type or Forms_table statements.

     comment:  <string>;
        defines a comment of up to 128 characters for this forms
        option.  It must be a quoted string.

     type:  <form type>;
        defines what type of forms definition this is.  Allowed
        definitions are "orientation", "font", "line_height",
        "uses" and "special".  See the notes on types below for
        further information.

     string:  <string>;
        defines the string to be tied to this option to enable
        it.  See the notes on strings below for further
        information.

     page_height:  <size>;
        defines the effective height of the printed page for the
        forms option.  See the notes on sizes below for further
        information.

     page_width:  <size>;
        defines the effective width of the printed page for the
        forms option.  See the notes on sizes below for further
        information.

     char_height:  <size>;
        defines the effective height of the characters for the
        forms option.  See the notes on sizes below for further
        information.

     char_width:  <size>;
        defines the effective width of the characters for the
        forms option.  See the notes on sizes below for further
        information.

     line_height:  <size>;
        defines the effective height of the line for the forms
        option.  See the notes on sizes below for further
        information.


     uses:  <name>[,<name>...,<name>];
        defines that this forms option is a combination of the
        given name options.

     NOTES ON STRINGS:  The TTF convention for initial_string
     and/or additional_info is used when defining the escape
     string for the "string" field.  The string is specified as
     one or more substrings where each substring may be one of
     the following:

  1) A quoted string; e.g., "sR".  If a quoted string is to
     contain a quote character, that quote must be doubled.
     (e.g., "s""R" is s"R).

  2) A single unquoted character such as X, A, p, $ or @.  This
     notation is only allowed for "simple" characters.  This
     notation may not be used for control characters, white
     space, ASCII digit characters, "(", ")", "<", ">", " ", ":",
     ",", ";", or the double quote character.

  3) A single quoted character such as "X", ";", "B", or "0".
     Any ASCII code can be entered this way.  Note that digits
     should be specified as "0", not 0.

  4) A 1 to 3 digit octal number such as 177, 14, or 007.  This
     enters the character whose octal representation is as
     specified.  Note that 0 is interpreted as octal 000.  If the
     ASCII digit "0" is desired, it must be specified as "0" or
     060.

  5) The name of a control character, such as DEL.  These may be
     either upper or lower case.  All standard control characters
     are accepted, including:

               NUL SOH STX ETX EOT ENQ ACK BEL (000 - 007)
               BS  TAB LF  VT  FF  CR  SO  SI  (010 - 017)
               DLE DC1 DC2 DC3 DC4 NAK SYN ETB (020 - 027)
               CAN EM  SUB ESC FS  GS  RS  US  (030 - 037)

     In addition, SP (040), DEL (177), NL (012), and HT (011) are
     also accepted.

  6) Control characters may also be entered in the form ^A, which
     is read as control-A, and is the character sent when the
     control-A function is used on an ASCII keyboard.  ^A is
     equivalent to SOH, or 001.  The letters A-Z (upper or lower
     case equivalent) preceded by a "^" may be used for 001
     through 032.  Also accepted are ^@!(000), ^[!(033),
     ^\!(034), ^]!(035), ^^!(036), and ^_!(037).


     NOTES ON SIZES:  The definition of the <size> value is
     <number>[<units>].  The value of <number> may include a
     decimal point.  The default for units is "inches" which may


     be shortened to "in" or "i".  In addition, the values of
     "points", "pt" or "p"; "centimeters", "cm" or "c"; or "lpi"
     (for lines per inch) are also accepted.


     NOTES ON TYPES:  Each of the types has a unique function in
     defining the complete format option.  The complete format
     option defines:

     o    the orientation of the printing on the page,
     o    the font and the size of the characters to be output,
     o   the number of lines on the page to be displayed.


     The following table describes required and optional keywords
     for each form type where R is Required, O is optional and -
     is not used.

Page 15-22; add the following paragraph after "Remote Driver
<string> Arguments".

     VARIABLES FOR REMOTE_DRIVER_

     The following variable will be allowed in the args or
     minor_args definition of a device.

     indirect= <name>; defines the pathname of a segment or
        archive component containing text to be used in place of
        the arg or minor_arg strings.

     The following variables are allowed in the remote_driver_
        minor_args definition.

     model= <name>;
        defines name of particular model of printer.  In the
        initial release, the model names of "hblp", for the Bull
        Model 80 laser printer, and "applelw", for the Apple
        LaserWriter will be the only models supported.  If the


        "paper_type:  single;" keyword is used, this field is
        required.  There is no default.
