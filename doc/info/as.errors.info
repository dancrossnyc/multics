Description

559  phx20928
If a daemon attempts to send a large amount of data such as a
multi-segment file to the message coordinator message segment, the
daemon process and subsequently the initializer process get terminated
via an any_other handler invoked due to a out_of_bounds condition when
the message segment gets filled up.

557  phx17133
Absentee qres values need to be recomputed whenever abs_maxu changes.
When "abs maxu auto" has been specified, abs_maxu can change whenever
attempting to schedule a new job.  load_ctl_'s set_abs_maxu procedure
should be changes to recompute abs qres values for each queue.

553  phx14788
A negative dollar amount is computed when a user runs up a large number
of vcpu time.

552  phx18230
If new_user is called to change an attribute which does not effect the
mail_table_, mail_table_priv_ is still called to look for mail table
entry.  This can cause problems if the administrator does not have
proper access to mail_table_priv_ as may be the case where a site has
designated administrators for different areas of the system.  There are
some user attributes which do not effect the mail_table_.

551  phx14789
Output of system_monthly_report shows an inconsistancy in the number of
crashes that is reported.

550  phx18792
"write_user_usage_report" calculates the "-to" date incorrectly in some
cases.

544  
On a successful dialin to an anonymous dial server the AS message
doesn't have the asterisk on the dial server name.  It reads
"ignored.Sectest_4.TestProj" instead of "*ignored.Sectest_4.TestProj".

543  
The lg_ctl_ msg "raised initial ring for TestProj.TestProj..." for
anonymous users does not include the * in front of TestProj.  Also for
lowering rings.

542  
When the tries field of the installation parameters is set to 3, the
lg_ctl_ message "too many bad passwords..." is appearing in the log
after every other bad password instead of after every third one.

541  
The user message facility will allow a user to retrieve a message
destined for a lower ring if the user knows the message ID.

In fact, the only access checks being done are AIM checks.

The user_message_$read_message entrypoint did not correctly perform
access checks when the user specified a message via its message id.
Also, various security attributes about the message were not correctly
returned to the user.  Finally, the ability to delete-on-read did not
correctly function for messages specified by message id.

540  
Due to the remnants of the PL/I compiler's padded reference bug,
dial_ctl_ was unable to reliably use the required_access_class
information for STY channels.

539  
When a user attempts to priv_attach a channel, the answering service
compares channel access class information in the CDT with the user's
process authorization.  However, it takes no steps to guarantee that
the information in the CDT is up-to-date, and indeed, in many
situations this information will not be correct.  The erroneous
assumptions can cause channels to be attached when AIM restrictions
should prevent it, as well as situations where channels will be denied
attachment when AIM should permit the attachment.
The priv_attach request does not perform a get_required_access_class
control order before attaching the channel.

538  
With the rings in the PDT at 4,6,6 and the rings in the SAT at 4,5, an
attempt to log in at the default ring is denied with an audit message
saying that the ring was lowered from 6 to 5.  It should have been
granted at the lowered ring.

537  
When a slave-service channel hangs up, its current_access_class_valid
flag is not reset.  This prevents processes from attaching it at any
access class other than the access class it was first attached at.

536  
The Answering Service allows a login when the user's access on the
channel ACS is incomplete (e.g.  R_ACCESS or W_ACCESS).
It should check for RW effective access to the ACS.

535  
The Answering Service com_channel_info request does not audit when it
denies a request.

534  
The Answering Service process_termination_monitor request does not
audit when it denies a request.

533  
The Answering Service note_pnt_change request returns a zero status
code even when it denies the request (though the deny is correctly
logged).

532  
The Answering Service daemon_command request returns a zero error code
even when it denies the request (though the DENY is correctly logged).

531  
The terminate_dial_out request, unlike the others (including the
release_channel request) does not check for the dialok atttribute.  It
also does not send a "contrl" message.  All dial_ctl_ requests are
supposed to send acknowlegement "contrl" IPC messages.

The dial_out request checks to see if the channel is in use before
checking the service type of the channel, producing an incorrect error
message for login service channels.

530  
The access check made for communications channels is supposed to
require RW access to the ACS segment in >sc1>rcp.  It currently allows
access to the channel if the user has any non-null access to the ACS
segment.  The fix is to require RW access.

529  
The variable which holds the textual added info in the communications
channel audit messages is too short to include the entire error
message.  The fix is to increase this character string variable from
100 characters to 256.

528  
The module which performs access auditing in the answering service,
as_access_audit_, fails to correctly set the grant flag in the binary
audit header logged in the answering service log.  Although the
GRANTED/DENIED messages are correct in the messages, the binary flag is
inconsistent with this message -- automated tools therefore fail to
pick up the DENIED-type messages.  The functional tests fail as a
result.

527  
In MR11, when a communications channel hangs up, a LOGOUT message is
audited if the channel underwent a Identification and Authentication
(I&A), that is, if a userid/password was supplied during preaccess
(login, dial, slave) time.  Due to the use of a common entry in
dial_ctl_ and the way autocall (dial_out) channels are terminated, the
system attempts to audit a LOGOUT message for all autocall channels, as
well as slave/dial channels.  The resulting message looks something
like:

     LOGOUT . int a.h000 (hangup)

since there is no userid/projectid associated with the autocall
channel.  The fix is to have dial_ctl_$dial_term distinguish between
autocall and slave/dial channels.

526  
The PNT software does not follow the normal access model due to details
of its internals and the fact that it depends on MSF software.  Certain
error codes are not as might be expected, and some operations behave in
non-obvious ways.  No actual security holes are believed to exist,
however.

525  
No message of the form "Your authorization is ..." is displayed when
you reconnect to a process which is not at system_low.
Move "Your process authorization is..." message from act_ctl_ to
dialup_.

524  
Messages placed in the AS user message message segment by the
Initializer process have null process ids.

523  
Due to the incorrect setting of a variable in the AS user message
database header, certain entries in this database can become
inaccessible when other entries are deleted.

522  
Due to the new kernelized message segment software changes, some
security critical process idenfication information is not stored
correctly in the "user message" database, implemented as a message
segment.  Because of this, those who retrieve the messages from the
database get garbage in the secure sender information.  This facility is only
used by the get_com_channel_info_ subroutine in MR11 and therefore has
no serious side effects.  The fix however involves filling in more
information in the call to mseg_ which specifies the access properties
of the calling process.

521  
When a user new_proc's to a different AIM level the "DESTROY" audit
message claims that the old process authorization was the destination
level.

520  phx19955
The initializer command "abs bump absX" leaves the request in the queue
as "running".  It should update the request to be "bumped".  (See AS
31.)

516  phx18591
If the "-destroy" and "-hold" control arguments are used on the login
command line, the process is destroyed but the line is not held.  If,
however, the "destroy -hold" request is used at the disconnected
process prompt, the line is held correctly.

515  phx19596
The module syserr_log_man_ needs a record_quota_overflow handler around
the code which acutally copies the syserr_log.  Currently, if it gets a
record_quota_overflow condition, it causes an asdump.  It should print
a message on the bootload console instead.

514  phx19595
The module sc_process_command_line_ needs an io_error condition handler
so that if the communications channel on which a command has been
entered hangs up, the request line can be aborted.  Currently, an
asdump results.

513  phx19594
The is_legal_proj active function should allow it's being invoked as a
command.  If it is invoked as a command, an absurd error message about
wrong number of arguments is displayed.  At the very least it should
diagnose it's invocation as a command and print an error message.

512  phx19586
The substty command is broken in MR11.  It no longer allows one to
redirect MC messages from the bootload console to another MC terminal.
This is due to a coding error which causes an attempt to reference
through an invalid cdte pointer.

511  phx19584
The module mc_tty_ fails to set the version number in the terminal_info
structure prior to issuing the terminal_info control order.  This will
cause this call to always fail resulting in this code's loopoing.

509  phx19585
The subroutine get_com_channel_info_ returns an unimformative error
message when an attempt is made to get info on a channel not attached
to the calling process.  It would appear that the AS does no auditing
of attempts to get info on channels not attached to the calling process
as a second issue.

508  phx19583
Slave channels which have been accepted and then dropped hang up
permanently, rather than receiving a new login banner.  Note that this
refers to using the "accept" and "drop" operator commands.

507  phx19570
The operator command "bump UserA" results in the error message:
   bump: error:  is not a valid Person.Project

This is because of a coding error in the internal procedure
get_pers_proj of admin_.  The bump command, as well as all its brothers
and sisters, need to be completely rewritten.  admin_ is a mess.

506  phx19557
The program pnt_fs_util_$create, called by create_pnt, enables the
keep_meters flag in the MSTB header.  It shouldn't, since not all
processes which have R access to the PNT also have RW access.

504  phx19468
reset_proj may leave PDT entries locked, lacks a cleanup handler, has a
myriad of other problems and should be rewritten.

503  phx19474
If you attempt to connect to a process with a higher authorization when
a lower one was specified on the login command line, get refused, and
then attempt to specify the higher authorization on the login command
line, the login is rejected due to a sticky single class access class
not being reset to the login channel access class range.

502  phx19459
When new_user prompts for the Notes field in a change request, a null
response wipes out the old values of the Notes field rather than
leaving it alone.  This is inconsistent with the normal meaning of a
null response.

501  phx19377
If a load_mpx fails because the channel id in the prph card is
incorrect, subsequent load_mpx and stop_mpx requests result in
seg_fault_errors.

500  phx19434
When logging in with disconnected processes and using the "list"
preaccess requests, all disconnected processes are displayed, even
those which AIM prevents the user from connecting to.

Further, if you specify "-ring" on the login command line, and you have
disconnected processes, the "list" command will display all processes
and allow you to connect to one of them even if the default ring for
that process is different from the one you specified on the login line.
The list command gives no indication of the default ring for the
process.

497  phx19301
The "-all" control argument to the "install" command is very confusing.
Things would be greatly simplified if it were removed entirely.

495  phx19388
When changing time zones, as in from EST to EDT, the b_and_w program
indicates that during the gap, the system was down.

493  phx19385
If the intercom command is sent via a send_admin_command, a null
pointer fault results since there is no mc_ate in this case.

492  phx19389
When ad administrator changes a passwords, the date/time password
changed field is not updated in the PNT.  This may cause the first
attempted login to fail with a "password expired" message if the
relevant password expiration installation parameter is enabled.

491  phx19391
If you type "l my_name -cdp" when attempting to log in, dialup_
responds with "login:  syntax is" without providing any further
information.

490  phx19383
The entry dialup_$reintroduce may provide a code path whereby an
attempt is made to use utep before it is initialized.  This will cause
a fault and an answering service dump.

487  phx19300
write_user_usage_report does not display the grand summary report for
device charges.

486  phx19298
Specifying an illegal subsystem name on the login command line will
provoke a situation where the process cannot be fully created, but at
the same time cannot be destroyed.  This uses up an APTE slot for the
duration of the bootload.

485  phx19303 phx19308
The initializer "disconnect" command does not work consistently.  Some
times it does not work at all.  Sometimes there are error messages,
other times none.  This command should work either by userid or by
channel id just as the other commands work.

484  phx19241
The install command should be able to diagnose the specification of
unauthorized flags and values when PDTs are installed.  Specifically,
if the PDT-to-be-installed specifies the "vinitproc" attribute, and
this attribute is not authorized for the project, the install atttempt
should at least send a warning message to the installer.  There may be
other bad values/attributes which whould be detected as well.

483  phx19302
The audit messages associated with communications channels and dialids
include "DENIED" even when the reason for the failure has nothing to do
with security.  There should be a differentiation between errors not
having to do with access checking and access control errors.

479  phx19261
There are several cases where dialup_ logs "ignored alarm___" messages
in the AS log.  These are caused by bugs in this program.  These should
be fixed.  Additionally, if these cannot all be fixed, at least these
log messages should not cause a console alarm.

478  phx19252
write_billing_summary handles a blank requisition field incompatibly
with the other billing commands.

477  phx19249
The admin.ec "x repair" entry will fault and cause an AS dump if an
invalid directory is specified.

474  phx19234
Master directories which reside subordinate to directories without
terminal quota are not charged for.

472  phx19222
The program reset_use_totals assigns rate structure numbers based on
the first project encountered in the control file for that bin.  If the
project has been deleted, or is not in the sat, then the default rate
structure number is used without any warning.  It should use the rate
structure of the first valid (non-deleted) project in the control file
for the bin and should indicate if and when it uses the default value.

471  phx19221
While the program usage_total records misc charges in the use_totals
database, it does not include these charges in the dollar charge
figure.

469  phx19213
The send_daemon_command command, with the "quit" keyword will print the
error message "process lacks permission to alter device status" if the
process to which the quit is directed has not enabled quits.  This is a
non-informative error message.  In fact, the message coordinator
interface to the quit command returns the same error code; this should
be changed as well.

467  phx19198
absentee_user_manager_ can leave the answer table locked if it gets a
non-zero error code from the call to cpg_$cpg_abs.

466  phx18908
The MSF directory of the PNT should have ring brackets of 1,5 rather
than 1,1.

465  phx18546
The ed_mgt "v" request should not allow more than one project to have
"max_prim" set to -1.  up_mgt_ should never install such an MGT.

464  phx17292
The list_output_request command seems to behave inconsistently when the
"-position" control argument is used and one lacks "r" access to the
queues.  Sometimes it reports incorrect access, sometimes it doesn't.
In any case, it reports that there are no requests in the queue, even
if this is not true.  See TR.

463  phx18988
If a user issues the "new_proc" request for a disconnected process, and
that process is already in the process of logging out (due to
inactivity or fatal error) the user receives the logout message rather
than just being given a new process (i.e.  like the result of a
"create").

462  phx18962
For a "login Userid -cpw" login, if the user inadvertently types his
proposed new password to the "Password:" prompt and types it again for
the "Password again:" prompt, the answering service gives the error
indicating that the two passwords were the same instead of one
indicating "pasword incorrect."

461  phx18958
Specifying "create -ns" in the login connect loop does not prevent the
start_up.ec from being executed in the new process.

459  phx18907 phx18997
The extended entry support for PNTs should include
get_user_access_modes support.

458  phx18874
The value of project.n_users gets out of sync when process creation
fails causing spurious error messages for subsequent logins.

456  phx18845
The cv_cmf command is not particulary friendly if a typo is made in
specification of minor devices.  See TR for details.

453  phx18768
The cancel_abs_request command sometimes reports the wrong user-name
when indicating what request is cancelled.  This only occurs, of
course, if the "-user" control argument is used.

452  phx18719
The print_pnt command (new_user) should check access to pnt_admin_gate_
before attempting to call it rather than bombing out with a
linkage_error.

449  phx18492
The cv_cmf command should not allow the specification of 300 baud
bisync channels since the hardware doesn't.  Also, the cdt table
installation software should reject this as well.

447  phx18249
The cv_cmf command allows the specification of illegal channel numbers
(like a.h232) in the CMF to be converted.

445  phx17703
The move_(abs daemon output imft retrieval)_request commands should
not, without explicit action, change the project of the request.

440  phx16963
The "-position" control argument to the list_abs_requests (and friends)
affects which entries will be displayed.  See the TR for further
details.

439  phx16887
When the answering service grabs a terminal back from the user after a
fatal process error, it should do something about getting the
terminal's modes into a better state.  When the terminal becomes
connected to the new process, it can be in a strage state and the user
may not know what to do to get it into a useable state again.

436  phx16308
The login command line "login Personid -cpw -cdp" provokes a syntax
error.  There is nothing wrong with this command line.  (Yes, there is.
-cdp requires a project.  The error message sucks, though.)

435  phx16126
The list_(abs output retrieval daemon imft)_requests commands should be
more intellignet when supplied with multiple "-user" control arguments.

431  phx15571
It should be possible to delete an FNP from the CDT by reinstalling a
CDT with the FNP deleted.  Currently, it just leaves the FNP in the CDT
with 0 configured subchannels.

428  phx15276
Control arguments, such as "-long" and "-brief" should positionally
overide previous control arguments rather than being declared
incompatible in the list_output_requests, list_abs_requests,
list_daemon_requests, etc.  commands.

412  phx18528
ms_table_mgr_ needs an entrypoint which will return a list of all
entries which match a given string case-insensitively.  This will allow
a solution for this TR to be implemented.

409  phx19058
The list_as_request program needs a "-admin" control argument to
display all user's requests, and its default action should be changed
to display only the calling user's requests.

407  phx19057
The as_request.ms messages segment should have "r" access set for
SysAdmin and SysMaint each time it is recreated (i.e.  each time the
answering service is initialized).

406  phx19102
Answerbacks should not be allowed to contain control characters.
ttt_info_, which already does some editing of the answerback (terminal
id), should be changed to disallow various control characters.
Otherwise, the terminal ids ruin output displays of the "as_who"
command, and the initializer "who" command.

405  phx19032
The cv_pmf command should provide a warning when an attempt is made to
give the save_on_disconnect or disconnect_ok attributes to anonymous
users since these flags are not honored for anonymous users.

403  phx19014
When a process disconnects (with save_on_disconnect enabled) two LOGOUT
audit messages will be logged.  One is logged at disconnect time, and
the other at inactivity bump time.  This is confusing.  Further, the
CPU-time/Charges figures do not appear consistent.

401  phx18882 phx20928
Attempting to perform a large amount of output on a message coordinator
terminal can cause the terminal to hang up and the bootload console to
be flooded with errors indicating the OOSB on mc.message.  In MR11.0
systems, it can crash the system.

399  phx18693
If requested to operate on a volume that lacks the PD flag,
vacate_pdir_volume should query the operate to continue, not simply
refuse the request.

398  phx18694
The vacate_pdir_volume command, with the long option, is very verbose
and noisy (beeps the console).

397  phx18546
The answering service install function screws up when installing an MGT
in which a max_prim value changes from -1 to some other value.

396  phx18323
When notifying a non system_low user that an "inactivity bump" has been
cancelled, the answering service causes an error message "dialup_:
Insufficient access to return any information..." to be logged.  While
I haven't been able to reproduce this problem due to inactivity bump
times being inordinately long on CISL-SERVICE, I suspect that this
problem exists due to a similar problem already confirmed in error list
entry 395.  I have confirmed that the notifications are being sent in
the error list entry 395 case, so I suspect that they are being sent in
this case as well.

This problem seems only to happen when the project directory, and
therefore the home directory containing the user's mailbox is non
system_low.

395  phx18322
When an non system_low process submits an absentee job, attempts by the
absentee facility to notify the submitting process of events (because
of the "-notify" enter_absentee_request option, or because of some
error) result in the message "absentee_user_manager_:  Insufficient
access to return any information.  Unable to notify Person.Project of
absentee event".

The notification, however, is delivered to the submitting process.
Only the error message logged is invalid.  This problem only occurs if
the project directory itself is non system_low, and hence the home
directory is non system_low.

394  phx18406
Since record_quota_overflows are explicitly enabled in as_init_, the
any_other handler in this module should be capable of handling a
record_quota_overflow condition and printing an appropriate message
which describes the directory which took the rqo.  It currently doesn't
special case the rqo condition and therefore just prints the condition
name in the error message displayed on the console.  Not very helpful
in diagnosing the problem.

393  phx18245
On some terminals, the printer_off sequence only applies to the current
line rather than until a printer_on sequence is sent.  Because of this,
the password masking scheme used in dialup_ does not work on these
terminals since it sends a printer_off control order, prints a NL, and
then prompts for the password.

390  phx18201
The print_log command, when used with the "-nhe" control argument,
prints a trailer (blank line).  Since headers are inhibited, the
trailer should probably be as well.

386  phx17860
The amount of time that a line is "dialed" to a process (rather than a
user being logged in over that line to the process) is not added to the
dialed up time in the cdt.

385  phx17085
The Initializer warn function causes the user's terminal to double echo
afterwards, when the user was running video or emacs.  A better
interface between blast and terminals and modes is needed.

381  phx17157
Certain faults occuring within absentee_user_manager_, prior to the
setting of ute.uprojp, cause the Initializer to enter an infinite fault
loop in its cleanup procedure.

379  phx11773
When the as hangs up a line, it should clear the pending terminal
buffers after printing "hangup".  This helps avoid strange things such
as replaying pending input lines (such as passwords).

378  phx17361
sweep does not correctly account/un-account master directory quota when
walking down a sub-hierarchy.

375  phx15593
A damaged pdt in >sc1>pdt will stop AS initialization in its tracks.

374  phx17081
>sc1>stat_seg should contain a lock to avoid conflicts between
copy_as_meters and as_meter_.

372  phx15774
The sweep command could help performance a lot by force deactivating
directories it no longer needs.

369  phx16754
If a user is in the process of reconnecting during a shift change, the
work class recomputation may conclude that the mgt is clobered due to
examining a partially initialized ute.

365  phx15956
If no start_up.ec can be found when starting a process, either the
process_overseer_ should so state or make the initial command line
null, instead of making the initial command line "exec_com" which then
gets an error.

361  phx15212
It is not possible to have daemons who do not have access to
system_privilege_ logged in at higher than system_low.  This is because
the higher authorization process cannot write into >sc1>mc.message.

360  phx14301
Absentee jobs that are set into a different load control group than
their user is in interactively (via the MGT parameters that treat
absentee jobs specially) are counted against the load control limits of
their ORIGINAL group, instead of the group that they are shifted into.

358  phx16925
Answering service logging hardly ever logs the involved channel in
messages involving users.  Int the days of mostly hardwired terminals,
this was OK.  Nowadays, just logging terminal type and answerback is
useless.  Channel names have to be added to the lg_ctl_messages.

356  phx16914
The message coordinator has no smarts with respect to over-filling Q's.
If an output Q's fills due to a termina that is dead, but cannot (due
to lack of a DTR wire) hang up, the AS will hang on it.

If a Q gets too deep the output should go someplace else.

354  phx16706
load_ctl_status has an ioa_ typo.  See the TR for details.

353  phx16906
The post-crash PDT cleaner-upper seems to leave some
reconnection-oriented fields silly.  See the TR for an example.  This
analysis is incomplete.

352  phx16517
abs suspend/release destroys the CPU monitor corresponding to the max
vcpu specified for the job.

350  phx15243
as_meter_ uses a bogus declaration of config_deck and
consiquintiquentially only sees 64 cards.

348  phx15302
LINE_TELNET dim type should be invalidated.

345  phx14257

asdumps (timer_manager_err) occur.  Believed caused by intense absentee
logout activity.

ed_installation_parms doesn't do very well with a specified path.  In
addition, the -directory control argument is said to not function.

306  phx11695
sc_signal_handler_ should detect recursive invocations.

304  phx13395
The login_responder (pit) and initproc (pdt) fields should be longer.

300  phx12654
dial_manager_ should use some IPC mechanism which is isolated from
channels otherwise in use by the process.  This requires dial_ctl_ to
maintain another IPC name per process.

299  phx13105
b_and_w report does not properly when the -week control argument is
specified and the report is crossing a month.

298  phx13106
print_projfile does not determine if there are misc charges correctly.

297  phx13103
The ttp request (and -ttp login argument) do not cause all the
attributes of the channel to be affected.  For example, delays are not
set.

296  phx13079
user_info_ and system_info_ should use assign_.

If an attached console is in admin mode and the terminal is
disconnected, cleanup should occur such that any program running which
is doing I/O is revoked, admin mode exited, etc.

278  phx12190
list_abs_requests does not show the entire resource string, only the
first 256 characters.  This is caused by the declaration of the variable
'buffer'.

274  phx03725
message coordinator will happily 'use' a terminal which is on an FNP not
available (IOM deconfigured) to the system.

272  phx11424
Overflow of a message coordinator device queue will cause the MC to loop

operator commands for channels can cause data-base corruption if used on
multiplexer channels.

trm_ handler for absentee says that the reason for termination will be
sent by Multics mail.  It is really sent as a message.

262  phx11931
return_tty_to_mc_ does not mask ipc signals during operations on
user_i/o.

260  phx11857
I/O daemons need to be able to determine the rate_structure of a user
without having access to the SAT.  Documentation needs to be improved on
the access required to rate_structure_?  segments, etc.

258  phx11957
enter_abs_request does not check a -rsc string.  (It's not clear that
there is a facility for this at MR9 time.).  The absentee manager does
not detect the fact that an attempt to run a job with an invalid -rsc
string has occured, and continues to attempt to run the job
periodically.  (each time, an error occurs processing the -rsc string.)

257  none
Inactive calculation for disconnect processes should use the time of
disconnection instead of activity times.  This would cut a disconnected
process properly, even if it is sometimes active for copying ITT
messages.

255  phx11303
When calculating MTBF, the system routines should use the formula
MTBF<-TIME/CRASHES rather than MTBF<-TIME/(CRASHES+1).

253  phx04883
The crank should not delete the backup copies of the RCPRM registries
until it finishes making the new ones successfully.

252  phx11654
disk_usage_stat assumes that a directory will have no more than 2000
names in it.  It faults if one has any more.

250  phx11320
process creation failure may cause looping, attempting to create a
process.

246  phx11193
accounts_overseer_ does not handle signalling the program_interrupt
condition properly.  It should do a 'start' if the pi handler returns.

244  phx10248
the bills should show the actual dates of the billing period, rather
than some values which more-or-less indicate the first and last use of
the project within a billing period.  (It might be useful to DEFINITELY
calculate those values, too.)

243  phx05916
There should be a good interface for controlling message coordinator
terminal output

240  phx06594
sweep accumulates space used figures for zero quota accounts if a
directory has one but not both segment and directory quota.

dialup_ fumbles trm_ response, other wakeups

212  phx09391
Absentee jobs terminated because max.  CPU time is exceeded do not have
their 'finish' handlers executed.  Same for command environment
re-entry.

202  phx05894
AS should do a number of resetreads:  before answerback, after bad login
word, etc.

197  phx07557
daemon login does not honour -ns.  (Actually, it does not report that
access prohibits use of -ns.)

181  phx08314
The 'load control group full' message prints even if -force is given.

177  phx06103
new_proc does not reset all terminal modes.

Shifts >4 cause ed_mgt to fail.

144  phx06524
Initialization should be retryable after failure.

142  phx07052
Some modules are missing syserr message documentation (operator error
message documentation).

140  phx06545
Some messages from daemon_user_manager_ are improperly split when they
are too long for one log entry.

Foreground absentee count can be inaccurate while absentee_user_manager_
is running.

The messages sent to users when another instance logs in are not
handled properly.  Some way to notify the current user reliably without
disturbing what he is doing needs to be designed.

FG absentee jobs waiting on resources will sometimes not be checked
often enough.

The answer table lock is sometimes left set, requiring a force_reset to
do installs.

50  phx05278
Disconnected processes sometimes get fatal errors on attempts to release
through the sus_signal_handler_ frame.  Hardcore error 154.

46  phx04853
Process preservation data bases can get into an inconsistent state.

45  phx04792
Error messages can be lost because a resetwrite is done after printing
the error message and before returning to the user.

43  phx04608
Proxy absentee jobs are inaccessible to the user on whose behalf they
were submitted.  Messages for proxy jobs should be sent to proxy user
and the submittor.

42  phx04706
Disconnected processes still accept messages.

edit_proj cannot remove an alias from a project.

22  phx03291 phx08499
mar to a queue with a lower CPU time limit can cause a job to be
deferred indefinitely.  Action should be if user is using default cpu
limit, use default of queue (consistent with ear using same and not
saying anything about implicit time limit).  If not using default cpu
limit, should query if new queue has lower limit.  Should warn if new
queue will never run, as does ear.

21  phx03154
Blast messages are sent to all instances of a user even if a channel is
specified.

20  phx03073
There are race conditions allowing a login to get through a stop.
dialup_ should stop login/process-creations in progress.

Error messages printed after failure of AS initialization are very
cryptic.

3  phx01536
If a project is delegated to a system administrator or daemon, that user
is given incorrect access to some system segments.
