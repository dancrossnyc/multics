03/13/84  canonicalize_mailbox

Syntax:  canonicalize_mailbox path {-control_args}


Function:  converts the messages in a mailbox into their canonical form
as defined by the MR10.2 mail system.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the mailbox whose messages are to be converted.
   The suffix "mbx" is supplied if needed.  The star convention is
   accepted.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   temporarily alters your access to the mailbox when necessary to
   convert the messages in the mailbox (see "Access required" below).
-no_force, -nfc
   never alters your access to the mailbox.  (Default)
-privilege, -priv
   uses privileges to bypass the restrictions on the canonicalization
   process introduced by the Access Isolation Mechanism (see "Notes on
   AIM" below).
-no_privilege, -npriv
   does not use privileges.  (Default)


Access required:  You must have status (s), modify (m), and append (a)
access to the directory containing the mailbox.  In addition, if
-force is not specified, you must have read (r), add (a), and delete
(d) extended access to the mailbox itself.

If -privilege is specified, you must have execute (e) access to the
system_privilege_ gate and your maximum process authorization must be
system_high.


Notes: The canonical form of a message is similar to the text of the
printed representation of that message when formatted using the default
formatting modes.  For a description of the canonical form, type
   help message_format.gi -section canonical form

Messages stored in mailboxes prior to MR10.2 were not stored in their
canonical form.  Unless these messages are converted to their
canonical form, subsystems, such as read_mail, that provide the option
to select message by content are required to format the messages
during the search.  This formatting while searching severely affects
the performance of the selection process.

Messages stored in a mailbox after the installation of MR10.2 are
stored in canonical form and will not affect the performance of context
searches.


This command needs to be used only once on any given mailbox.  It is
especially recommended that this command be used on any large mailbox
(e.g., logboxes or saveboxes containing more than fifty messages).

This command first creates a new mailbox in the same directory as the
mailbox whose messages are to be converted.  The messages are then
read from the original message, canonicalized, and stored in the new
mailbox.  Next, the names, access control list, maximum length, and
safety switch setting of the original mailbox are moved to the new
mailbox.  Finally, the original mailbox is deleted.

If the directory containing the original mailbox has insufficient
quota for the new mailbox, the original mailbox is left intact and an
error message is printed.


The record of any process accepting messages on the original mailbox
is lost during the canonicalization process.  You must reissue the
accept_messages command, if needed, for each mailbox that is
processed by canonicalize_mailbox.  Due to the nature of the
accept_messages command, the explicit pathname of your default
mailbox (>udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx) must be supplied if
that mailbox is canonicalized in order to reaccept messages.

After a mailbox has been canonicalized, all messages in the mailbox
are owned by the user who issued the canonicalize_mailbox command.  If
you originally placed a message in the mailbox, you cannot delete it
if you have own (o) extended access on the mailbox.  Normally, this
side effect of canonicalization is invisible for logboxes and
saveboxes as only the creator of the logbox or savebox has access on
that mailbox.


Notes on AIM: If the Access Isolation Mechanism (AIM) is in force at a
site, several restrictions are placed on the use of
canonicalize_mailbox.  These restrictions are eliminated through the
use of -privilege provided that you have sufficient access to use that
control argument (see "Access required" above).

To use canonicalize_mailbox, your process authorization must be equal
to the access class of the directory containing the mailbox whose
messages are to be converted.

Unlike ordinary segments, the access class of a mailbox may be greater
than the access class of its containing directory.  Each message in a
mailbox has its own access class; the access class of the mailbox
specifies the maximum access class for any message that may be added
to the mailbox.


If the access class of a mailbox is greater than your process
authorization, it may contain messages that you can not read.  If you
were to canonicalize that mailbox, any such messages would be lost.
Therefore, the canonicalize_mailbox command queries for permission to
continue if asked to process a mailbox whose access class is greater
than the process authorization.  Unless you are quite certain that
there are no upgraded messages in the mailbox, you should answer "no"
to this query and ask a system administrator to canonicalize the
mailbox using -privilege.


The canonicalized mailbox created by this command has an access class
equal to your maximum process authorization.  If this access class is
less than the previous acess class of the mailbox, a warning is
issued.  If the new access class is insufficient (e.g., a mailbox
shared by several users with different maximum authorizations), ask a
system administrator to reclassify the mailbox via the
reclassify_sys_seg command.
