Description

0507  phx20861
update_mail_table_entry and add_mail_table_entry are not consistent in
validating addresses.  update performs no validation while add
performs validation which causes a problem when the entry is a forum
meeting to which the system administrator does not have access.

0504  phx20700
An entry cannot be deleted from the mail table using
delete_mail_table_entry if the directory in which the object segment
resided has been deleted from the system.  delete_mail_table_entry
should verify that the pathname of the entry is valid, and if not,
inform the user and query him for whether the entry should be deleted.

0502  phx20589
In read_mail, execution of some of the active requests causes the
current message to be updated with the result of the request.  The
current message should remain unchanged.

0495  phx20027
mlsys_utils_$parse_mailbox_control_args adds an extra ".mbx" in the
error message when the user specifies "<something>.mbx", and leaves
out the ".mbx" if the user didn't specify it.  The problem is that the
sense of the "has_suffix" test at TRY_USER_NAME_OR_MTE_HUERISTIC is
backwards.

0494  phx19989
mail_table_mgr_ doesn't always ignore error_table_$checksum_failure
when looking up an entry.

0491  phx19688 phx20316
If the Acknowledge-To field in a message specifies a mail table entry
that doesn't translate to a local mailbox then
mail_system_$acknowledge_message returns mlsys_et_$bad_acknowledge_to.
Either mail_system_$deliver_message should be changed to specify
User.Project if the sender's mail table address is not a local mailbox
(currently it only does this if the mail table address is invalid,
e.g.  it specifies a nonexistent entry or is circular), or
mail_system_$acknowledge_message should be changed to use the sender
address if the acknowledge_to address is not a mailbox.  The latter is
preferable, as it handles the case in which the address becomes
invalid after the message has been sent.

0483  phx16735
 The mail system should not require a valid Date field in order to
 accept a message header as valid.  It should, if no valid Date field
 is present, use the earliest available Delivery-Date field in the
 message or, if none are present, the Delivery-Date supplied by ring 1.
 If any date/time field is missing a time zone or contains an invalid
 time zone, the mail system should assume GMT.

0471  phx08922 phx08923 phx11356
 The read_mail and send_mail write, preface, and append requests
 should not trap record quota overflows.

0465  phx17468 phx19307
 The network mail support supplied as part of the TCP/IP RPQ
 interprets the address
      User%Foreign-System at Local-System
 as equivalent to
      User at Foreign-System via Local-System

 When the original address is used by a system that does not itself
 recognize this "%" convention, it will deliver any mail for the
 address to the local system which will then forward it to the foreign
 system for actual delivery.

 In addition, the mail system of several other operating systems will,
 when sending mail via a mail gateway, change all local address in the
 message from
      User at System
  to
      User%System at Gateway-System
  on the assumption that the gateway system follows the "%" convention.

 When a Multics system is used as the gateway for a message whose
 addresses have been so transformed, the foreign recipients of the
 message will be able to reply to the message because the addresses in
 their replies will be interpreted by the network mailer.  However, the
 local recipients of the message will not be able to reply because the
 Multics mail system proper does not follow the "%" convention and will
 interpret the transformed addresses as the names of mail table entries.

 The message parser, therefore, must be changed to follow the "%"
 convention when parsing local addresses.

0464  phx18294
 A user's mail table entry should include a local mailbox pathname in
 addition to a mailing address.  If a user does not set his local
 mailbox, it will default to his mailing address if said address is a
 local mailbox; otherwise, it will default to the default mailbox on
 his default project.  Options should be provided when using mail
 table addresses to indicate whether the mailing address or local
 mailbox is to be used when actually delivering a message to the
 address.  This entry is defined as a problem because, without these
 changes, the message facility (send_message) can not make proper use
 of the mail table to send messages to users without having to know
 on whic projects they are registered.

0463  phx16250
 The mail system attempts to guarentee that it will always deliver an
 acknowledgement for any message requesting one by sending a "negative"
 acknowledgement if the message is deleted without a prior call to
 mail_system_$acknowledge_message.  However, as the mailbox_ gate is
 accessible from the user ring, a program can either call
 mailbox_$delete_index to delete a message directly or delete the
 entire mailbox using the delete command.  In these cases, the mail
 system will not be able to acknowledge the message.  This problem can
 only be solved by restricing the mailbox_ gate to the mail system ring
 and forcing all message and mailbox deletion to pass through the mail
 system.

0462  phx18308
 The message parser does not recognize Redistributed-cc and
 Redistributed-bcc as synonyms of the Redistributed-To field.

0461  phx18509
 The to, cc, from, and reply_to requests always add any "-log" and
 "-save PATH" addresses to the bcc field.  In addition, the remove
 request will only try to remove these addresses from the bcc field.

0460  phx19035
 If all addresses given on a send request line have syntax errors,
 the send request will attempt to send the mail to the recipients
 given in the message header rather than aborting.  For example,
      send_mail User1 -rql
      ...
      send User2 -comment
 will send the message to User1.

0459  phx19118
 The "-between_time" message selection control argument's test for
 a valid date/time range is inverted.  As a result, any attempt to use
 this control argument will either complain about an invalid range or
 fail to find any messages which lie in the desired range.

0458  phx19187
 mlsys_utils_$print_message_summary will generate an out_of_bounds
 fault when invoked with a line length shorter than 15 characters.
 In fact, this entrypoint should not attempt to include any part of
 the subject in the summary when the line length is under 22
 characters as that is the minimum line length required to insure that
 at least one character from the subject will appear in the summary.
 (This entrypoint is the one used by the read_mail list request.)

0457  phx15783 phx19099
 If a read_mail request which defaults to the current message is
 invoked without message specifiers but with the "-only_deleted"
 control argument, the request will process the current message.
 However, as the current message can never be a deleted message, this
 scenario should always produce the error message
      read_mail (REQUEST): Message N is not a deleted message.

0456  phx19090 phx20005 phx20977
 If a message contains more than 9999 lines,
 mlsys_utils_$print_message_summary will signal the size condition
 when trying to format the line count for insertion into the message
 summary.  (This entrypoint is the one used by the read_mail list
 request.)

0455  phx17868
 The targets of the mail_system_, mail_table_,
 mail_table_initializer_, and mail_table_priv_ gates do not properly
 access their parameters.  Both input and output parameters are
 referenced multiple times and data structures are not properly
 copied.

0454  phx18557 phx20253
 The installed print_mail command believes that it is version
 "3.0a EXL" and that its "new_features" info file resides in
 >exl>info rather than >doc>info.

0453  phx18528
 mail_table_$get will report that its input string is ambiguous if it
 refers to a single mail table entry which has more than one name which
 differ only by case and the supplied string does not exactly match one
 of the entry's names.  For example, if a mail table entry has the
 names "Le-Mann" and "LE-MANN", calling mail_table_$get with the string
 "le-mann" will fail.

0452  
 The message parser does not recognize the "{invalid STR}" address
 construct.

0450  phx18036
 mail_system_$deliver_message and mail_system_$redistribute_message
 will incorrectly claim that the message has been delivered to a
 mailing list if the abort-on-errors delivery option is selected, all
 addresses in the mailing list are valid, and at least one other
 recipient of the message is invalid.

0449  
 When parsing messages in the mailbox, the mail system will use the
 Message-ID field of the original mailing for any redistributions
 rather than using the appropriate Redistributed-Message-ID fields.

0448  
 The address control argument parser inverts any explicit route
 supplied by the user with "-via" control arguments.  I.e.
      USER -at HOST -via A -via B -via C
 is interpreted as
      USER -at HOST -via C -via B -via A
 causing "A" to be used as the first relay system instead of "C"
 when the message is transmitted.

0447  phx17498
 When the mail system canonicalizes a system name (ie:  removes all
 domains in common with the local system name), the resulting name may
 be ambiguous.  For example, if the local system name is CISL.ARPA,
 the mail system will canonicalize the name SMALL.ARPA into SMALL even
 though the NIT may contain distinct systems named SMALL.ARPA and
 SMALL.MIT.  The mail system should check for such ambiguities and, if
 detected, not remove any domain names from the system name.
 (Eventually, the NIT itself will provide a name canonicalization
 service.)

0446  phx17353 phx17540 phx18564
 If the last message processed by a read_mail request is a deleted
 message specified via "-include_deleted", the request will set the
 current message to said deleted message.  The current message should
 never be a deleted message.  Instead, the current message should be
 set to the first undeleted message after the deleted message.  This
 behavior will make the use of "-include_deleted" equivalent to the
 request line:
      retrieve N; REQUEST N; delete N

0445  phx17774 phx20967
 The mail table interfaces used to set data in the table do not
 interpret the mail table name in a case insensitive manner.  As a
 result, the set_mailing_address command, when used with "-entry",
 must be given the exact spelling of the mail table entry.

0444  phx17501
 The mail table software permits the creation of circular entries.
 For example:
      smla A -entry B
      smla B -entry A

0443  
 The mail system can not parse Relayed fields containing relay IDs or
 recipients if the field is in canonical form.

0442  phx17497 phx19470 phx19355
 When computing the route to be used to send a reply to a given
 message, the mail system should use the implicit route (Return-Path)
 associated with the message if it can not compute the route based
 on information from the NIT.

0431  phx17154
 The mail system will discard the Delivery-By field if the address
 contained therein is equal to the address in the Sender field (or
 From field).  However, only the address constructed for the
 Delivery-By field actually contains the project ID of the user who
 delivered the mail.  Thus, messages no longer include their
 author's project ID.

0401  phx13551 phx18851 phx20089
 If certain errors occur during execution of the "print_original",
 etc.  requests in send_mail, the send_mail created to compose the
 reply will be aborted and the user left back in read_mail.  Errors
 which cause this action include referencing non-existent messages,
 syntax errors in message specifiers, etc.

0369  phx09121
 send_mail will allow the user to add the same address to the To
 or cc field multiple times; it should reject attempts to add the
 duplicates.

0362  phx06801 phx08877 phx10009 phx15485
 read_mail should check for new messages after every request line
 rather than only before certain requests; otherwise, much
 confusion is generated when new messages arrive and the keyword
 "last" is used.

0212  
 Case independent searching should apply to the message text, as
 well as to the header fields.
