The object_info_ subroutine returns structural and identifying
information extracted from an object segment.  It has three entry
points returning progressively larger amounts of information.


Entry points in object_info_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  brief:  02/03/84 object_info_$brief


Function:  This entry point returns only the structural information
necessary to locate the object's major sections.


Syntax:
declare object_info_$brief entry (ptr, fixed bin(24), ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call object_info_$brief (seg_ptr, bc, info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the base of the object segment.  (Input)
bc
   is the bit count of the object segment.  (Input)
info_ptr
   is a pointer to the object_info structure in which the object
   information is returned.  It is defined in the include file
   object_info.incl.pl1.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  display:  02/03/84 object_info_$display


Function:  This entry point returns, in addition to the information
returned in the object_info_$brief entry point, all the identifying
data required by certain object display commands, such as the
print_link_info command.


Syntax:
declare object_info_$display entry (ptr, fixed bin(24), ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call object_info_$display (seg_ptr, bc, info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the base of the object segment.  (Input)
bc
   is the bit count of the object segment.  (Input)
info_ptr
   is a pointer to the object_info structure in which the object
   information is returned.  It is defined in the include file
   object_info.incl.pl1.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


:Entry:  long:  02/03/84 object_info_$long


Function:  This entry point returns, in addition to the information
supplied by the object_info_$display entry point, the data required by
the Multics binder.


Syntax:
declare object_info_$long entry (ptr, fixed bin(24), ptr,
     fixed bin(35));
call object_info_$long (seg_ptr, bc, info_ptr, code);


Arguments:
seg_ptr
   is a pointer to the base of the object segment.  (Input)
bc
   is the bit count of the object segment.  (Input)
info_ptr
   is a pointer to the object_info structure in which the object
   information is returned.  It is defined in the include file
   object_info.incl.pl1.  (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)
