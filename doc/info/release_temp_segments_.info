:Entry: release_temp_segments_: 09/25/86  release_temp_segments_

Function: returns temporary segments (acquired with the
get_temp_segment_ or get_temp_segments_ subroutine) to the free pool
of temporary segments associated with each user process.  Through the
pool concept, temporary segments can be used more than once during the
life of a process.  Since the process does not have to create a new
segment each time one is needed, overhead costs are decreased.


Syntax:
declare release_temp_segments_ entry (char(*), (*) ptr, fixed bin(35));
call release_temp_segments_ (program, ptrs, code);


Arguments:
program
   is a 32-character field identifying the program on whose behalf the
   temporary segment is to be used.  This field is displayed by the
   list_temp_segments command, and is also used by this subroutine to
   identify the caller as the owner of the temporary segment being
   released.  Besides giving the name of the command or subroutine
   invoked by the user, it can also briefly describe how the temporary
   segment is used; for example, "sort_seg (sort indexes)".  (Input)
ptrs
   is an array of pointers to the temporary segments being released.
   (Input/Output)  The pointers in the array are set to the null value
   after the segments are successfully returned to the free pool.
   This fact can be used by callers to determine if a given temporary
   segment has been released.  Null input values are not treated as
   errors; no action is performed for them.
code
   is a standard system status code.  (Output)


Notes:  A nonzero status code is returned if any segment being released
was not assigned to the given program.  See the description of the
get_temp_segments_ or the get_temp_segment_ subroutine for a
description of how to acquire temporary segments.
