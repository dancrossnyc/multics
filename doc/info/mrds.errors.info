Known errors in the current release of mrds.
#	Associated TR's
Description

169  phx20856
When mrds is updating the segments in the resultant_segs.dir it can get
a no_write_permission fault.  This happens when the person is a DBA
(sma access on the database dir), but doesn't have write permission on
the segments.  The copy_resultant_data module should check for this
before trying the update.

168  phx20271
This error occurs with MR11 mrds but is fixed with MR12 mrds.  See the
TR for complete details.  If preventive scope is set with MR11 mrds,
the problem doesn't occur.

167  phx18744
When a check_proc determines that a domain value isn't acceptable, mrds
prints an error message and doesn't do the store or modify.  The error
message should also include the name of the attribute because there is
ambiguity when more than one check_proc is associated with a tuple.

166  phx20850
When dsl_$compile is processing run time ".X." arguments, it
incorrectly handles char varying and bit varying.  The solution is for
mrds_dsl_translate to set the argument pointer to the beginning of the
length word, instead of at the beginning of the bit or character
strinng.

165  phx20666
If you give an unrecognized control arg to rmdb's ready_db request you
get the error_table_$bad_arg error message instead of
error_table_$badopt.

164  phx15756
When a conversion error occurs during a data conversion, the details
are a bit lacking in the sub_err_ call.  This TR suggests that the
error message should also specify which datum couldn't be converted.

162  phx19173
When the trouble switch of a database gets turned on, people who
currently have the database open are still allowed to set scope.  The
trouble switch setting only prevents new people from opening the
database.

147  phx19911
MRDS needs to find out that the data management system isn't available,
at open time.  Currently it doesn't find out until set scope time, and
then closing the database to recover from dm_not_available_ runs into
the same problem because the close operation requires a transaction to
be in progress.

128  
Selection expression parsing needs to generate better error messages.

102  
When mrds creates the saved resultant directory in the database, it
only gives read acls to the creater of the saved resultant and the
SysDaemons.  This means that most people who use the database will not
be able to use the saved resultant.  Mrds should give acls to whoever
is allowed to open the database.

A somewhat related problem is that mrds creates the saved resultant
with the ring brackets of the creating process.  If another DBA in a
higher ring tries to open the database after this, mrds tries to
recreate the saved resultant and fails.  This produces a warning
message that may affect a linus user.

101  
When translating a selection expression, mrds will incorrecly match any
left subset of the name.  Thus if the database contains a relation
named my_relation, the selection expression "-range (x my_re) -select
x" will select it as will ones using m, my, my_, my_rel, etc.  When two
or more relations match the left subset, mrds will choose the first it
finds in its internal tables.

97  
dmdbp terminates prematurely when it encounters a relation the user
does not have read access on even though there are other relations he
does not have access to.

85  
In the cmdb listing, the options used in the db creation are not
properly included in the "Options:  " line.

83  phx14522
When a relation has ring brackets set up to allow, for example rw in
ring 4 and r in ring 5 (rb 4 5 5), and the DBA is in ring 5, the
attempt is made to force rw access to the relation, resulting in a
not-in-write-bracket condition.  The program determining this is
mu_get_relation_acl.  He should either a) look at the raw access (as
opposed to effective access which considers rbs,) b) have a handler for
not_in_write_bracket around the call to
mrds_dm_authorization$set_needed_access or c) have such a handler in
mrds_dm_auth_etc...

81  
The number of and-groups that linus can have is around 30 instead of
the maximum of 100.  The problem is that linus creates a mrds selection
expression of the form:
          (((G1) | (G2)) | (G3)) which causes the node stack in the
optimize to overflow.  THe stack is based on max_pred_depth.

80  
setting a permit scope of modify also sets a permit scope of retrieve

65  
mu_sec_make_res does not properly diagnose no_execute_permission.

63  
The file model is constructed such that several 18-bit offsets are not
word or even half-word aligned.  In particular the rel_ptr spans a word
boundary.  This apparently causes significant performance degradation.
To fix it would cause an incompatible change, but it should be done.

62  
The following modules do not respect the directory specified by
set_mrds_temp_dir:  cmdb, rmdb and (apparently) dmdm.  If this fix is
made, the smtd needs to be changed.  It currently states that it only
affects openings.  We consider this to be a design flaw.

50  
The variable CFLD59_DESC in mis-declared (packed bit on) in both
mrds_builtin_ and mrds_v1_builtin_.

28  
dmdsm The cmdsm command does not detach the submodel.  Several
invocation of the command will overflow the pdir or pat.

18  
mrds_dsl_store expects that the relation name be a character string.
Since we now allow stores into temp rels still is not always the case.
Note that if the temp rel index is converted into a character string
stores can be done but it should not be necessary to do the conversion.

2  phx08878
cmdsm can no longer accept 2 submodel relations defined from the same
model relation.

cmdsm can be made to accept a submodel that defines multiple submodel
relations over the same model relation.  The problem is that the use of
such a submodel can cause problems.  For instance concurency control is
based on the model relation what happens when two different scopes are
set on the different submodel relations ?  In order for mrds to handle
this its entire scoping scheme would have to be redesigned.  Rather than
allow strange things to happen during application package execution it
was felt that no permitting the submodel to be created would be better.
