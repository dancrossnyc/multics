02/12/85  format_line_nnl, flnnl

Syntax as a command:  flnnl control_string {args}


Syntax as an active function:  [flnnl control_string {args}]


Function: is the command/active function interface to the ioa_$nnl
subroutine.  When used as a command, the formatted string is printed
without a trailing newline.


Arguments:
control_string
   is an ioa_ control string used to format the return value of the
   active function.
args
   are character strings substituted in the formatted return value
   according to the control string.


Notes: The following ioa_ control codes are allowed (see the ioa_
subroutine).  The control string is output exactly as is except that
certain constructs beginning with a caret (^) are expanded, which may
involve argument substitution or interpretation.  Unimplemented
constructs are output as is, but avoid them to allow for future
extensions.


 CONTROL           ACCEPTABLE ARGUMENTS
 ^a   ^Na          any character string
 ^d   ^Nd          a character representation of a number, including
                   optional exponent (315.44 or .2789e+2 or 1101b)
 ^i   ^Ni          same as ^d
 ^f   ^Nf          same as ^d
 ^.Df ^N.Df        same as ^d
 ^e   ^Ne          same as ^d
 ^o   ^No          same as ^d
 ^[...^            "true", "false", or an integer character string
 ...^]             any number of any character string
 ^(...^) or
 ^N(...^)          an integer character string.
 ^s  ^Ns


In addition, you can use any of the following carriage movement
controls:
      ^N/      ^N|      ^N-
      ^Nx      ^N^      ^R
      ^B       ^t       ^Nt
      ^N.Dt    ^/       ^|
      ^-       ^x       ^^

where N is an integer count or a "v".  When you give "v", an integer
character string from the args is used for count.

If you don't give optional arguments, the value returned depends on the
ioa_ control string that you specified.
