02/15/85  logout

Syntax as a command:  logout {-control_args}


Function: terminates your session and ends communication with the
Multics system.  It signals the finish condition for the process and,
after the default on unit for the finish condition returns, closes all
open files and destroys the process.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   prints neither the logout message nor, if you give -hold, the login
   message.
-hold, -hd
   terminates your session but not communication with the system: you
   can immediately log in without redialing.


Notes: If your site is security conscious, it may have disabled
"logout -hold"; in this case if you wish to change authorization, do
this:
   1. log out
   2. verify, using terminal/modem indications, that the terminal has
      dropped DTR and that the system acknowledged by dropping DSR
   3. log in at the new authorization.


This procedure is the only way to guarantee that you are communicating
with the answering service and not with a Trojan horse.

DTR and DSR are EIA RS232 control signals that are part of the
interface between your terminal and the system.
