:Entry: cv_dec_: 02/06/84  cv_dec_

Function: accepts an ASCII representation of a decimal integer and
returns the fixed binary(35) representation of that number.  (See also
cv_dec_check_).


Syntax:
declare cv_dec_ entry (char(*)) returns (fixed bin(35));
a = cv_dec_ (string);


Arguments:
string
   is the string to be converted.  (Input)
a
   is the result of the conversion.  (Output)


Notes:  If string is not a proper character representation of a decimal
number, a will contain the converted value of the string up to, but not
including, the incorrect character within the string.

This function can be performed more efficiently in PL/I by--

      a = convert (a, string);
