02/06/85  before_journal_status, bjst

Syntax as a command:  bjst {PATHS} {-control_args}


Function: displays status information for before journals that you
have access to open.  This command is part of the command level
interface to Multics data management (DM).


Arguments:
PATHS
   are the relative pathnames of before journals for which status is
   desired.  If you supply no pathnames, status information for all
   journals in use in the process is displayed.  If you don't give the
   .bj suffix, it is assumed.


Control arguments:
-all
   displays the status of all journals active in the current invocation
   of the data management system (DMS) that you have access to open.
-brief, -bf
   displays the pathname, unique identifier, usage state or activity,
   control interval size, and control intervals in the before journal
   for each journal specified that is either in use or not in use.


-long, -lg
   for each journal specified that is in use, displays, besides the
   above information, the disposition of control intervals in use,
   i.e., if they are buffered, put, flushed, or on disk; the last time
   a control interval was queued or written; the time the header was
   updated; the last record id; the status of images not yet written on
   disk or not being flushed; and the number of users and transactions
   using the journal.  For each journal specified that is not in use,
   displays, besides the information given by -brief, the time the
   header was updated.


Notes:  If you give neither -brief nor -long, the command yields the
information supplied by -brief plus the disposition of control
intervals in use at the time of the request if the journal(s) specified
is in use.
