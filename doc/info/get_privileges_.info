:Entry: get_privileges_: 02/02/84  get_privileges_


Function: returns the access privileges of the process.


Syntax:
declare get_privileges_ entry returns (bit(36) aligned);
privilege_string = get_privileges_ ();


Arguments:
privilege_string
   is a bit string with a bit set ("1"b) for each access privilege the
   process has.  (Output)


Notes:  The individual bits in privilege_string are defined by the
following PL/I structure.  For each bit, "1"b = yes and "0"b = no.

   dcl 1 privileges    unaligned,
         2 ipc         bit(1),
         2 dir         bit(1),
         2 seg         bit(1),
         2 soos        bit(1),
         2 ring1       bit(1),
         2 rcp         bit(1),
         2 mbz         bit(30);


Structure elements:
   ipc
      indicates whether the access isolation mechanism (AIM)
      restrictions for sending/receiving wakeups to/from any other
      process are bypassed for the calling process.
   dir
      indicates whether the AIM restrictions for accessing any
      directory are bypassed for the calling process.
   seg
      indicates whether the AIM restrictions for accessing any segment
      are bypassed for the calling process.
   soos
      indicates whether the AIM restrictions for accessing directories
      that have been set security-out-of-service are bypassed for the
      calling process.


   ring1
      indicates whether the AIM restrictions for accessing any ring 1
      system segment are bypassed for the calling process.
   rcp
      indicates whether the AIM restrictions for accessing resources
      through RCP resource management are bypassed for the calling
      process.
   mbz
      is unused and is "0"b.
