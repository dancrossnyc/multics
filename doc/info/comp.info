01/30/87  compose,  comp

Syntax as a command:  comp paths {-control_args}


Function:  prepares formatted documents from raw text segments for
production on various documentation devices including typesetters, line
printers, and user terminals.  Output pages are composed from various
text blocks and controls provided in input files.  Detailed control
over page composition is provided by controls in the input file.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of the input files to be formatted.  The suffix
   compin must be the last component of the input file entryname;
   however, the suffix need not be given in the command line.  If two
   or more pathnames are specified, they are treated as if compose had
   been invoked separately for each.  Up to 200 input files may be
   given with one invocation of the command.  Output is produced in the
   order in which the pathnames are given in the command line.  Input
   files may be either single segments or multisegment files.  Output
   files for very large documents are converted to multisegment files.
   The star convention is not supported.


Control arguments:
   all control arguments specified in the command line apply to all
   input file pathnames given.  Control arguments may be freely
   intermixed with input file pathnames, except for -arguments which
   must be last in the command line.


-annotate {key key key ...}, -ann {key key key ...}
   shows all font/pointsize changes identified by the optional key
   (where key may only be "font" at the present time) in an extra
   column to the right of the formatted text and at the output line in
   which they occur.

   The style of a typeset document usually calls for a large number of
   font/pointsize changes to improve readability.  However, when one is
   limited to a terminal and/or lineprinter for early checkout of the
   documents, it is very difficult to determine if the changes are all
   being made correctly.


-arguments arg1 ...  argn, -ag arg1 ...  argn
   all fields following are string values to be placed in the
   indefinite set of program built-in variables named "CommandArg1"
   through "CommandArgn" where "n" is the count of such fields.  The
   program built-in variable "CommandArgCount" is set to "n".  If any
   argument is to contain blanks, it must be given as a quoted string.

   NOTE:  This control argument, if given, must be the last control
          argument in the command line.


-brief, -bf
   shows only the header line of the defined error line (i.e., the
   count of errors), both at normal termination and in response to the
   program_interrupt command.
-change_bars {x,p,l,r,d}, -cb {x,p,l,r,d}
   generates text change symbols in the output according to the
   parameters given.  Change symbols are shown in the text margins as
   determined by controls in the text.  (The default for change symbol
   generation is OFF.)  All the parameters for this control argument
   are optional but, if any are given, they must appear in the order
   shown.  If any parameter is skipped, its separating comma must still
   be given.  Skipped parameters retain their default values.  The
   parameters are:


   x      a change level character.  If the optional change level
          character in any change-bar control is less than x (in the
          ASCII collating sequence sense), then no text change symbols
          are inserted for those controls.  The x character may be
          either numeric or alphabetic.  (The default value for x is
          the SP (ASCII code 040) character.)
   p      a symbol placement key character.  It may have the values "l"
          for left margin, "r" for right margin, "i" for inside margin,
          or "o" for outside margin.  (The default for p is "o".)
   l      the definition of the text change symbol to be placed to the
          left of text.  It must be of the form n{string} where string
          is any character string and n is the separation from the
          text.  (The default value for string is a vertical bar (|)
          and the default value for n is 1.  The n may be given without
          string, but string may not be given without n.)


   r      the definition of the text change symbol to be placed to the
          right of text.  It must be of the same form as l above.
   d      the definition of the text deletion symbol.  It must be of
          the same form as l above except that the default for string
          is the asterisk (*).
-change_bars_art {x,p,l,r,d}, -cba {x,p,l,r,d}
   as for -change_bars above except that the strings in the l, r, and d
   fields may be given as conventional artwork symbols.  (The default
   values for the strings are also artwork symbols.)
-check, -ck
   performs syntax checking on the input file(s) by processing all text
   and controls but does not produce any output.  (The default for this
   feature is OFF.)


-device {name}, -dv {name}
   prepares output compatible with the device specified.  This control
   argument is used when the target device for output is not the
   default device for the output mode selected.  (If the -output_file
   control argument is given, the default device is "printer"; if it is
   not, the default device is "ascii".)  Any device for which
   name.comp_dsm exists is a supported device.

   NOTE:  A list of supported devices is available online.  To examine
          the list, type:

                 list_comp_dsm (lcdsm)

-from {n}, -fm {n}
   starts printed output at page n.  This control argument is mutually
   exclusive with the -pages control argument.  You must give the
   desired structured page number; for example, to print the fourth
   page of Section 3, you must give "-page 3-4".  (The default value of
   n is 1.)
-galley {n1}{,n2}, -gl {n1}{,n2}
   produces galley format (continuous single-column text without page
   headers and footers) output for lines n1 through n2 of the input
   file.  (The default value of n1 is 1 and the default value for n2 is
   the last line in the input file.)  If n2 is not given, the comma
   need not be given.  If n1 is not given, a comma must precede a given
   value for n2.  (The default for this feature is OFF.)


-hyphenate {n}, -hyph {n}, -hph {n}
   changes the default hyphenation mode from OFF to ON.  The optional
   parameter n is the length of the smallest separated word part.  (The
   default value of n is 2.)
-indent {n}, -ind {n}
   adds n spaces at the left page margin of the output.  This space is
   in addition to any indention given in the text.  (The default value
   of n is 0, that is, at the left-hand mechanical stop of the output
   device.)
-input_file path, -if path
   the name of an input file even though path may have the appearance
   of a numeric parameter or a control argument.
-linespace {n}, -ls {n}
   changes the default line spacing value to n.  The linespace control
   uses n as a minimum value.  (The default value for n is 1.)


-noart, -noa
   disables the conversion of conventional artwork constructs and
   inserts space into the output at the positions that such constructs
   would occupy.  (The default for the artwork conversion feature is
   ON.)
-nobell, -nob
   suppresses the audible BELL signal when signalling the "waiting"
   state to the user when the -stop or -wait control argument is used.
-nofill, -nof
   sets the default fill mode to OFF.  (The default fill mode is ON.)


-number, -nb
   prints  input line numbers  at the left  margin of the  output.
   The  line numbers  have the  form "i n" where  i is  the index
   number of an  inserted file.  A list of  inserted files showing
   the index numbers is written on user_output after completion of
   all text processing.  (The default for this feature is OFF.)
-number_append, -nba
   same as for -number above except that the insert file list is
   appended to the compout file (if any), starting with a new page.
-number_brief, -nbb
   prints input line numbers at the left margin of the output as for
   the -number control argument but the list of inserted files is not
   produced.


-output_file {path}, -of {path}
   directs the formatted output to a file instead of to the user's
   terminal.  The assumed output device is the Multics online printer
   but may be changed with the -device control argument.  If path is
   not given, then the output for all given input files is written to
   individual output files whose names are formed by replacing the
   suffix compin of the input file entrynames with the suffix compout.
   If path is given, then output for all given input files is
   accumulated in that single bulk output file.  (The default for this
   feature is OFF; that is, formatted output is written back to the
   user's terminal.)


-pages page_list, -pgs page_list
   specifies a blank-separated list of selected pages to be printed.
   Each element in the page_list must be either a single page, n, or a
   range of pages, n,n, where n is a structured page number as for
   -from above.  The page numbers given must steadily increase without
   duplication.  At least one page must be specified and up to 100 list
   elements may be given.  This control argument is mutually exclusive
   with the -from and -to control arguments.  (The default for this
   feature is OFF.)

   NOTE: Page number structures containing parentheses are changed by
          the command processor and must be given as quoted strings.


-pages_changed {x}, -pgc {x}
   specifies that, of the pages selected for printing (either all pages
   or some subset of pages selected through use of the -pages, -from
   and -to control arguments), only those pages containing text within
   the range of an active change-bar control or within the scope of the
   dot_page documentation macro are actually printed.  The base pages
   of the dot page set (for example, page 3 of the set 3, 3.1, 3.2) are
   not considered part of the dot page set.  This control argument is
   independent of the -change_bars and -change_bars_art control
   arguments, either of which must be given to cause the text change
   marks to be created.  The optional parameter x chooses the change
   bar level and must match the x parameter given with -change_bars for
   proper operation.  (The default value for x is SP (ASCII 040) and
   chooses all active change levels.)


-parameter {STR}, -pm {STR}
   assigns STR as the value of the built-in variable "Parameter".  (The
   default value for STR is an empty string.)
-passes n, -pass n
   processes the input file n times to permit proper evaluation of
   expressions containing variables that are defined following their
   reference(s) in the text.  No output is produced until the last
   pass.  (The default value for n is 1.)


-stop, -sp
   waits for a newline character (ASCII code 012) from the user before
   beginning each page of output and after the last page.  The pause is
   signalled by giving two BEL/HT sequences and returning the print
   head to the left margin.  If only a newline is typed, the next page
   is printed.  If a q is typed, the command invocation is terminated
   gracefully.  If an r is typed, the page just printed is reprinted.
   (The default for this feature is OFF.)
-to n
   ends output after the page numbered n where n is a structured page
   number as for the -from control argument above.  This control
   argument is mutually exclusive with the -pages control argument.
   (The default value for n is the last page.)


-wait, -wt
   waits for a newline character (ASCII code 012) before beginning the
   first page of output to the terminal, but not between pages (see the
   -stop control argument above).  (The default for this feature is
   OFF.)


Notes:  The program supports the severity active function with the
following severity schedule:

    0 - No errors
    2 - User  errors (undefined variables,  misspellings, invalid
        control parameters, etc.)  that prevent specific actions
    3 - Missing/inaccessible insert files
    4 - Program errors/limitations and/or internal
        inconsistencies that may cause a formatter abort
    5 - Command line errors that prevent any execution


The compose command directly supports the facility to change print
wheels on "diablo" type terminals during printing of a document.  The
standard device modules for "diablo" terminals assign print wheels as
follows:

        Diablo
Index   Order#      Name
  1     38101-01    PICA 10 (or equivalent 10-pitch wheel)
  2     38510       APL 10
  3     38102-01    ELITE 12 (or equivalent 12-pitch wheel)
