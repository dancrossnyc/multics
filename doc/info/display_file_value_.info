:Entry: display_file_value_: 02/01/83  display_file_value_


Function: outputs information about a file on a user-supplied switch.


Syntax:
dcl display_file_value_ entry (ptr, file, fixed bin (35));
call display_file_value_ (switch, a_file, code);


Arguments:
switch
   is a pointer to the iocb of the switch on which output is to be
   written.  If it is null, then iox_$user_output is used.  (Input)
a_file
   is the file, variable, or constant whose value is to be displayed.
   (Input)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Notes:
The output produced is, first, the values of the two pointers that
comprise a file.  If the file is closed, then a note to that effect is
produced, and the values of the file attribute block are given, and
that is all.

For all open files, the file name, address of its iocb, and pathname
are given.  If the file is neither stream nor record type, or if it is
both, then a note to the effect that the fsb is inconsistent is given.
Attributes relevant to the type of file (stream or record) are given.
For stream input files, the current input buffer is printed, with a
circumflex above the next character that is to be parsed.
