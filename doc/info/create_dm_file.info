02/05/86  create_dm_file

Syntax as a command:  create_dm_file path {-control_args}


Function: creates an unpopulated data management (DM) file for use
with Multics data management (see the Programmer's Reference Manual).
Files created in this manner would be used primarily for test purposes
or in applications calling the file_manager_ subroutine directly.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the DM file to be created.


Control arguments:
-concurrency, -conc
   provides automatic concurrent access protection to a protected DM
   file by enforcing locking conventions on get and put operations to
   the file (see "Notes").  (Default)
-no_concurrency, -nconc
   turns concurrency protection off for a protected DM file, saving on
   overhead when locking is unnecessary (see "Notes").
-no_rollback, -nrlb
   turns the rollback capability off for a protected DM file, saving on
   overhead when rollback is unnecessary (see "Notes").


-protected, -prot
   creates a protected DM file, which means the file is entitled to the
   protection features provided by the integrity services of data
   management.  You can access a protected DM file only within the
   context of a transaction.  (See "Notes.") (Default)
-ring_brackets W {R}, -rb W {R}
   sets the write ring bracket to W and the read ring bracket to R.  If
   you don't specify the read ring bracket, it defaults to the value
   given for the write ring bracket.  Both R and W must be greater
   than, or equal to, your validation level.


-rollback, -rlb
   provides an automatic rollback capability for a protected DM file,
   by logging before images of modifications made to the file.  These
   images are used in the event of transaction, process, or system
   failure to restore the file to its original state.  (See "Notes.")
   (Default)
-unprotected, -unprot, -not_protected, -nprot
   creates an unprotected DM file, without the benefit of integrity
   services.  You can access an unprotected DM file outside a
   transaction.  (See "Notes.")


Access required: You need sma access on the directory in which the DM
file is created and s access on the directory containing that
directory.


Notes: The -unprotected control argument is mutually exclusive with
-concurrency, -no_concurrency, -no_rollback, -protected, and -rollback.
If you use two mutually exclusive control arguments, the rightmost
option in the command line takes precedence.

This command is part of the command level interface to Multics data
management.
