12/28/82 unassign_resource, ur

Syntax:  ur resources {-control_args}


Function:  unassigns one or more resources that have been assigned to
the user's process by the Resource Control Package (RCP).


Arguments:
resources
   specify the resources to be unassigned from the user's process.
   Currently, the only resources managed by RCP are devices.  If a
   device is attached, it is automatically detached.


Control arguments:
-admin, -am
   forces an unassignment.  This control argument should be specified
   by highly privileged users who want to unassign a resource that is
   assigned to some other process.
-all
   Specifies that all devices assigned to the process be unassigned.
-comment STR, -com STR
   is a comment string that is displayed to the operator when the
   resource is unassigned.  This comment is displayed only once, even
   if several resources are being unassigned.  (See the assign_resource
   command for details about comment strings.)


Notes:  This command must not be used to unassign a device attached
through the tape_ansi_ or tape_ibm_ I/O module with -retain all
specified.  In that case, the user must specify argument 1 (no
retention) of the retention operation, before detaching the I/O module.
See the descriptions of tape_ansi_ and tape_ibm_ I/O modules.
