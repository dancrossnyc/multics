05/16/16  input_history, ih

Syntax as a command:
   ih attach {source_switch {monitored_switch}} {-control_args}
or:
   ih detach {source_switch}
or:
   ih version {source_switch}


Function: the attach operation inserts the input_history_ I/O module
between the IOCB named by source_switch and its currently attached I/O
module.  This current attachment is saved for future use on a new IOCB
named by the monitored_switch argument.

Each subsequent get_line operation on source_switch passes-thru
input_history_ to the monitored_switch.  input_history_ appends each
line received from the monitor_switch to a history file, then returns
the line to its caller.  Other operations pass-thru to the
monitored_switch, with results returned to the caller without action
taken by input_history_.


If source_switch is attached to window_io_ before the input_history
attach operation, then keystrokes are added to the window_io_
real-time line editor (which runs for each get_line operation) to
select past input lines (saved in the history file) for editing and
re-input.  See video_editing.gi.info for further information.

The detach operation stops capture of input lines in the history file,
and reconnects the source_switch to its original I/O module.  This
reverses the changes made by the input_history attach operation.

The version operation displays version numbers for this command,
and for the input_history_ I/O module.


Arguments:
source_switch
   is an existing switch attached to an I/O module open for
   stream_input or stream_input_output.  Subsequent get_line
   operations on this switch will be captured in the history file.
   (DEFAULT: -- user_i/o)
monitored_switch
   is a new switch created by the input_history command to save the
   I/O module attachment currently on the input_switch, so subsequent
   I/O requests can pass-thru the input_history_ module to the saved
   module.   (DEFAULT: -- input_history.time)


Control arguments: are input_history_ I/O module attach options.
-pathname PATH, -pn PATH
   use PATH as the location of the history file.  The default PATH is:
     [homedir]>[user name].history
-perprocess, -pp
   use a temporary history file created in the process directory.
-permanent, -perm
   use only a permanent the history file.  See "Notes on the history
   file" for further information on these three control arguments.


-lines N, -ln N
   recommends a size for the history file, in lines.  The default is
   200 lines (about 2 records of storage, if the average input line is
   40 characters in length).  (See "Notes on the history file" below.)
-truncate, -tc
   if the history file already exists, truncates this file as part of
   the attach operation.  The default is to extend the existing file.
