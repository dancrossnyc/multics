01/21/86  move_abs_request, mar

Syntax as a command:  mar request_identifiers {-control_args}


Function: moves a request from one absentee queue to another.  The
request is always placed at the end of the target queue.


Arguments:
request_identifiers
   you can specify them in one of the following forms:
   path
      is the full or relative pathname for the absentee input segment
      of requests to be moved.  The star convention is allowed.
   -entry STR, -et STR
      identifies requests to be moved by STR, the entryname portion of
      the absentee input segment pathname.  The star convention is
      allowed.
   -id ID
      identifies one or more requests to be moved by
      request_identifier.  You can use this identifier to further
      define any path or -entry identifier (see "Notes").


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   searches all queues for the requests to be moved.  It is
   incompatible with -foreground and -queue.  (Default)
-brief, -bf
   suppresses messages telling that a particular request_id was not
   found or which requests were moved when using star names or -all.
-foreground, -fg
   moves the requests contained in the foreground queue.
-queue N, -q N
   specifies that queue N for the given request type contains the
   request to be moved, where N is an integer specifying the number for
   the queue.


-sender STR
   moves only requests from sender STR.  You must give one or more
   request identifiers.
-to_queue N, -tq N
   specifies which queue to move the request to.  (Required)


-user User_id
   is a character string giving the name of the submitter of the
   request if not equal to the group ID of the process.  This control
   argument is primarily for operators and administrators.  User_id can
   be Person_id.Project_id, Person_id, or .Project_id.  You need both r
   and d extended access to the queue.  This control argument causes
   the command to use privileged message segment primitives that
   preserve the original identity of the submitter.  You need the AIM
   ring_1 privilege to preserve the original AIM attributes.  If ring_1
   privilege is not present, your AIM attributes are used.  (Default:
   only requests entered by you are moved)


Access required: You must have o extended access to the queue from
which the request is being taken, and a access to the queue to which
the request is being moved.  You must have r and d extended access to
move a request owned by another.


Notes: If you give any path or -entry, only one -id is accepted and it
must match any requests selected by path or -entry.

You can supply multiple -id identifiers in a single invocation only if
you give no path or -entry.

When you use no star names and a single request identifier matches more
than one request in the queue(s) searched, none of the requests are
moved; however, a message is printed telling how many matching requests
there are.

If the request is already running, it is not moved and a message is
printed.
