02/08/85  create_area

Syntax as a command:  create_area virtual_pointer {-control_args}


Function: creates an area and initializes it with user-specified area
management control information.


Arguments:
virtual_pointer
   is a virtual pointer specifier to the area to be created.  If the
   segment already exists, the specified portion is still initialized
   as an area.  (See virtual_pointers.gi)


Control arguments:
-dont_free
   is used during debugging to disable the free mechanism.  This does
   not affect the allocation strategy.
-extend
   causes the area to be extensible, i.e., span more than one segment.
   This feature should be used only for perprocess, temporary areas.
-id STR
   specifies a string to be used in constructing the names of the
   components of extensible areas.
-no_freeing
   allows the area management mechanism to use a faster allocation
   strategy that never frees.


-size N
   specifies the octal size, in words, of the area being created or of
   the first component, if extensible.  If this control argument is
   omitted, the default size of the area is the maximum size allowable
   for a segment.  The minimum area is forty octal words.
-zero_on_alloc
   instructs the area management mechanism to clear blocks at
   allocation time.
-zero_on_free
   instructs the area management mechanism to clear blocks at free
   time.
