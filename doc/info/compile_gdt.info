10/02/81	compile_gdt


Syntax:  compile_gdt segname {-control_args}


Function:  causes a segment containing the source of a Graphics
Device Table (GCT) to be compiled.


Arguments:
segname
   is the name of a segment containing the source of a GDT.  The
   suffix .gdt is assumed if not specified.


Control arguments:
-check, -ck
   specifies that the ALM assembler is not to be invoked, and that
   the intermediate assembler source file is to be retained.
-list, -ls
   specifies that the ALM assembler is to produce a listing of the
   GDT it creates.


Notes: A GDT source segment is conventionally named with the name of
the graphic terminal it describes, with th suffix ".gdt".  The
compile_gdt command compiles a GDT source segment into an assembly
language source segment.  The Multics ALM assembler is then invoked
internally to assemble this intermediate segment into a GDT.  The
final segment produced has the name of the source segment without the
suffix ".gdt".

Graphics System,. Order No. AS40.
