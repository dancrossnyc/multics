10/26/83  multics_library_search_

This subroutine is the library search procedure for the Multics
System Libraries.  Its entry points are referenced by
multics_libraries_, the library descriptor for the Multics System
Libraries.  These entry points can also be used to search other
libraries that have directories structured like those of the Multics
System Libraries.

For more information on the Multics Libraries, see the Multics Library
Maintenance manual (AN80).


Entry points in multics_library_search_:
   (List is generated by the help command)


:Entry:  source_dirs:  10/26/83 multics_library_search_$source_dirs

This entry point searches directories organized like the Multics
online source directories.  These directories contain archived and
unarchived source segments and exec_com control segments that are used
to create object segments.  The names of all archive components must
be placed as additional names on their respective archives.


:Entry:  object_dirs:  10/26/83 multics_library_search_$object_dirs

This entry point searches directories organized like the Multics
online object directories.  These directories contain archived and
unarchived object segments, backup copies of exec_com and absentee
control segments intended for user usage, and backup copies of MSFs.
The names of all archive components must be placed on their respective
archives.


:Entry:  list_info_dirs:  10/26/83 multics_library_search_$list_info_dirs

This entry point searches directories organized like the Multics
online lists, info, and include directories.  These directories
contain printable segments.


:Entry:  execution_dirs:  10/26/83 multics_library_search_$execution_dirs

This entry point searches directories organized like the Multics
online execution directories.  These directories contain bound and
unbound object segments, data bases, exec_com and absentee control
segments, and MSFs used by users.  Such directories are usually
included in user search rules.


:Entry:  hardcore_source_dir:  03/16/83 multics_library_search_$hardcore_source_dir

This entry point searches the Multics supervisor source directory.  It
is inappropriate for use on other libraries because it uses a
specialized system identification data base.


:Entry:  hardcore_bc_dir:  03/16/83 multics_library_search_$hardcore_bc_dir

This entry point searches the Multics supervisor bound components
directory.  It is inappropriate for use on other libraries because it
uses a specialized system identification data base.


:Entry:  hardcore_object_dir:  03/16/83 multics_library_search_$hardcore_object_dir

This entry point searches the Multics supervisor object directory.  It
is inappropriate for use on other libraries because it uses a
specialized system identification data base.
