10/28/80	Lisp, Subsystem

Syntax:  lisp {environment} {parameters}


Function:  enter the interactive Lisp subsystem.  In this subsystem,
Lisp forms can be typed at the user's terminal and evaluated.


Arguments:
environment
   the pathname of a segment created by saving a Lisp environment.
   Such segments have names ending in ".sv.lisp", which need not be
   supplied.
parameters
   character strings which can be read by Lisp functions within this
   lisp invocation.  These may be used by the initial form of the saved
   environment, which must be specified when parameters are given.  The
   Multics Lisp implementation is described in the MACLISP reference
   manual.  Chapters 1-3 of the revision 1 manual may be obtained
   from--

   The current price of the manual is $4.00, plus postage and handling.

   This manual describes most of the functions and features available
   (it was never completed) with the exception of I/O and compilation.
   These facilities were described in the now out-of-print revision 0
   (1974) of this manual.  All differences of the current
   implementation from this manual and improvements made to this
   implementation are described in the online documentation, listed
   below.	 This includes a number of very important facilities.

Notes on getting out of lisp:	 Lisp sets up a QUIT handler, which
prompts "CTRL/" for a letter or number telling it what to do.  Possible
responses are described below.  Signalling QUIT again while at this
point will suspend lisp.  This feature is designed to imitate the
handling of control characters in the ITS (pdp-10) implementation of
MACLISP, but only printing characters should be used to respond.
(Normal Multics quit-handling is available via the (status mulquit)
feature.	See lisp.changes.info.)

Evaluating the Lisp form "(quit)" will cause the invocation of lisp to
be terminated.  When in a read-eval-print loop, such as lisp "top
level", this form can simply be typed on the terminal to exit lisp.


List of CTRL/ responses:
B
   Enters a Lisp break loop, where lisp's state can be examined,
   modified, and restarted or aborted.
G
   throws control back to lisp top level, unwinding the Lisp stack.
Z
   suspends execution of lisp.  Lisp can be restarted with the "start"
   command, or the action of CTRL/G can be caused by using
   "program_interrupt" command.  This is similar in effect to
   signalling QUIT twice.
?
   Asks lisp what it is doing.  Execution continues.
.
   Does nothing.  Execution continues.	This is useful for making sure
   that lisp is in control.


Notes on lisp start up:  When lisp is invoked with no arguments, the
segment "start_up.lisp" in the user's home directory is loaded, if it
is found.	 This segment may contain the ASCII representations of Lisp
forms which will be evaluated, or it may be an object segment produced
by the Lisp compiler.
