04/10/84  display_audit_file, daf

Syntax as a command:  daf {path} {-control_args}


Function:  displays the file produced by the audit_ I/O module.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the audit file to be displayed.  If path is not
   indicated, the audit file associated with the user_i/o switch is
   assumed.  If user_i/o is not being audited, the audit file currently
   in use is displayed.


Control arguments:
-append_nl, -anl
   appends new lines to the end of entries that do not end in a new
   line.  It overrides -no_append_nl to the left in the command line.
   By default, new lines are appended if a "leader generating" control
   argument (i.e., -class_identifiers, -entry_numbers, or -metering) is
   present.


-class STR1 {...STRn}
   prints the entries having a class identifier matching any of the
   STRs.  Class identifiers are as follows:
      EL, el (edit line)
      IL, il (input line)
      IC, ic (input characters)
      OC, oc (output characters)
      TM, tm (trace of modes operations)
      TC, tc (trace of control operations)


   If STR contains only one character, it is matched on the first
   character of the class identifiers; for example, if STR is I,
   entries having either IL or IC class identifiers are displayed.  If
   -class is not given, the audit file is displayed without class
   identifiers.
-class_identifiers, -cli
   displays the audit file with the class identifiers before each
   entry.  If -metering is also specified, the metering information
   precedes class identifiers.
-entry_numbers, -etn
   prints the entry numbers before each entry.
-exclude STR1 {...STRn}, -ex STR1 {...STRn}
   excludes any entries containing strings matching any of the STRs.
   If -exclude is not chosen, all selected entries are printed.


-from STR, -fm STR
   specifies the first audit file entry to be displayed.  If STR is a
   positive integer, it is interpreted as an entry number.  If STR is a
   positive number containing a decimal point, it is interpreted as a
   time in 24-hour format.  If it is neither, the audit file is
   displayed from the first entry that matches STR.  If -from is not
   supplied, the audit file is displayed from the beginning.
-insert_nl, -inl
   inserts new lines whenever an entry is over length (as determined by
   -line_length or the current line length for the switch).  (Default)


-last STR
   displays entries beginning at the point specified by STR, starting
   at the end of the audit file.  If STR is in entry number format, the
   first entry displayed is STR entries back from the end of the file.
   If STR is in time format, the first entry is STR hours and minutes
   from the end of the file.  If STR is a character string, the first
   entry contains a match for STR searching from the end of the file.
   If -last is not selected, the audit file is displayed from the
   beginning.
-line_length N, -ll N
   inserts a new line after the character specified by N if a line of
   output is greater than N characters long.  A continuation line is
   indented to allow for any entry descriptors produced by -metering,
   -entry_numbers, or -class_identifiers and is preceded by an "*" to
   indicate it is a continuation of the previous line.


-match STR1 {...STRn}
   prints entries containing strings matching any of the STRs.  If it
   is not specified, all selected entries are printed.
-metering, -mt
   displays the audit file with metering information at the beginning
   of each line, preceding the class identifiers if -class or
   -class_identifiers is also used.
-next STR
   displays a given number of entries from an explicit point in the
   file to the point specified by STR.  If STR is in entry number
   format, the next STR entries are displayed.  If STR is in time
   format, the entries within the next STR period of time after the
   beginning entry are displayed.  If STR is a character string, the
   entries up to the next match of STR are displayed.  If -next is not
   selected, all entries to the end of the file are displayed.


-no_append_nl, -nanl
   does not append new lines to entries that do not end in a new line.
   This control argument overrides the appending of new lines because
   of "leader generating" control arguments or an occurrence (to the
   left in the command line) of -append_nl.
-no_insert_nl, -ninl
   does not insert new lines.
-output_file PATH, -of PATH
   displays the audit file into the segment named PATH.
-reverse
   prints the entries in reverse chronological order.


-string STR, -str STR
   uses STR as a character string with no special interpretation.  This
   is useful for preventing STR from being interpreted as a control
   argument, a time, or an entry number.  It can be given with -from,
   -to, -next, -last, -match, and -exclude, for example, "-from -string
   81" (see "Notes").
-switch STR
   displays the audit file associated with the I/O switch specified by
   STR if the I/O switch is currently attached.  If the I/O switch is
   not attached, an error message is printed.  If -switch is not
   chosen, the audit file associated with the user_i/o switch is
   displayed.


-to STR
   stops the display of the audit file at the point specified by STR,
   where STR can have any of the values for -from.  If -to is not
   specified, the audit file is displayed up to the end.


Notes:  You specify the format of the output, which entries are
selected to be output, and the file to which the output is directed.
(See attach_audit and the audit_ I/O module.)

The audit_meter mode must be on for there to be any metering
information in the audit file; without this information, time arguments
are invalid.

The -string control argument is useful in the following situations.  To
pass 1005.2 as a character string to be matched, rather than a time
value for -from, type

      daf -from -string 1005.2


To pass -last as a character string to -match, type

      daf -match -string -last
