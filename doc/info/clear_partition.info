02/28/84  clear_partition

Syntax:  clear_partition pvname partname {-control_args}


Function: overwrites the contents of a disk partition with zeros or an
optional user-supplied pattern word.


Arguments:
pvname
   is the name of the physical volume on which the partition to be
   cleared exists.
partname
   is the name of the partition to be cleared.  It must have four
   characters or less.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   produces brief format messages.
-long, -lg
   produces long messages.  (Default)
-pattern word
   overwrites the partition with data consisting of the specified octal
   pattern word. The specified word is written into every location in
   the partition.  If -pattern is not specified, a default of all zeros
   is used.


Access required: Access to the phcs_ and hphcs_ gates is required.


Notes: You are always queried whether the partition should be
overwritten; by default (if -brief was not specified) the contents of
the first eight words in the partition are displayed (in octal and as
ASCII characters) as part of this question, to aid in preventing
accidental overwriting of the wrong partition.
