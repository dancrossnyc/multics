:Info: entry_bound.gi: 02/10/82 entry bound

     For protection purposes, control must not be passed to a gate
procedure at other than its defined entry points.  To enforce this
restriction, the first N words of a gate segment with N entry points
must be an entry point transfer vector.  To ensure that only these
entries can be used, the hardware enforced entry bound of the gate
segment must be set so that the segment can be entered only at the
first N locations.  See the hcs_$set_entry_bound entry point.


:Info: entry_point.gi: 02/10/82 entry point

     An address in an object segment referred to by a symbolic name;
e.g., that which would be produced by the PL/I or FORTRAN procedure,
subroutine, or entry statements.


:Info: entry_point_name.gi: 02/10/82 entry-point name

     The name associated with an entry point in an object segment.
The entry-point name is found by the dynamic linker.


:Info: error_codes.gi: 02/10/82 error codes

     A value returned by a subroutine indicating either the success
of or the reason for failure to accomplish the requested action.
Associated with standard system error codes are certain predefined
messages that tell what happened.


:Info: exclamation_point.gi: 02/10/82 exclamation point convention

     A name, generated from a system clock value, that is
guaranteed to be different from any other name so generated (e.g.,
!BBBnZNlqLQddRJg).  Also called a shriek name.  See the unique
command.


:Info: fault.gi: 02/10/82 fault

     A hardware signal similar to an interrupt that may cause the
signalling of a condition.


:Info: file.gi: 02/10/82 file

     A term that stands for segment and/or multisegment file.


:Info: frame.gi: 02/10/82 frame

     A pushdown list where active procedures maintain private regions
used for temporary variables and interprocedure communication.


:Info: gate.gi: 02/10/82 gate

     The only point at which a procedure in an outer ring can transfer
to a procedure in an inner ring.


:Info: hardcore.gi: 02/10/82 hardcore (hardcore supervisor)

     The set of routines that perform the supervisory functions of the
system.  The hardcore executes in ring 0.


:Info: hierarchy_backup.gi: 02/10/82 hierarchy backup

     The hierarchy backup system dumps (copies) user segments and
directories onto removable storage (magnetic tape).  The dumping
is conventionally done using the processes Backup.SysDaemon and
Dumper.SysDaemon.  The information dumped can be recovered by the
operations staff at the user's request.  See the
enter_retrieval_request command.


:Info: home_directory.gi: 03/05/82 home directory

     The home directory is the working directory of a user when he or
she first logs in to the system (also known as the initial working
directory).  Usually this directory has a pathname of the form:

	     >udd>Project_id>Person_id
