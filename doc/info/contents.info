Syntax as a command: contents path {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [contents path {-control_args}]


Function: prints or returns the contents of a segment or archive
component as a character string.


Arguments:
path
   is an absolute or relative pathname to the segment or archive
   component to be processed.


Control arguments:
-exclude STRING, -ex STRING
   does not print lines containing STRING.  Exclusion is done after
   matching.  Thus, "-match A -exclude B" prints all lines with an A
   except those with a B.
-exclude /REGEXP/, -ex /REGEXP/
   does not print lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.  (See the qedx command for the definition of
   regular expressions.)
-from X, -fm X
   begins printing from the Xth line.  This control argument and -last
   are incompatible.  (Default: line 1)


-from /REGEXP/, -fm /REGEXP/
   begins with first line matching the regular expression REGEXP.
-match STRING
   prints only lines containing the character string STRING.
-match /REGEXP/
   prints only lines containing a string matching the regular
   expression REGEXP.
-newline, -nl
   leaves newline characters in the segment unchanged.
-no_newline, -nnl
   changes newline characters in the segment to blanks in the string.
   (default)
-requote_line, -rql
   requotes each line in the segment and changes newline characters in
   the segment to blanks.
-to N
   stops printing with line number N.  (Default: to print all lines)
-to /REGEXP/
   stops printing with the first line matching the regular expression
   REGEXP.  The search for REGEXP begins after the first line printed.
