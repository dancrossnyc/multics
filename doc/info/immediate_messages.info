      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix .mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix .sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.
-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table.

   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR;
   if no mailbox is found, STR is then interpreted as -save STR; if no
   savebox is found, it is interpreted as -user STR.

options that may have been specified by accept_messages (see
accept_messages and print_messages).
