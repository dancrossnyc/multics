02/13/84  clean_card_pool

Syntax:  clean_card_pool -age N {-control_arg}


Function:  deletes inactive card image segments (in the
>daemon_dir_dir>cards subtree) created by the system card reading
process.

The user must be able to call the system_privilege_ gate to use this
command.


Control arguments:
-age N
   deletes all segments in person directories in the pool whose
   date-time-modified (dtm) is older than N.  Also, all person
   directories whose dtem is older than N are are deleted.
   This control argument is required.
-quota N
   indicates that N pages of unused quota are to be left on each
   remaining access class directory.  If N = 0, then the quota is set
   to the Number of pages used.  The default for N is 0.


Notes:  After the pool is cleaned, all empty person directories and
access class directories are deleted.  All links and directories
contained in a person directory are deleted regardless of age.  All
links and segments in an access class directory are deleted regardless
of age.
