08/04/86  pascal_area_status

Syntax as a command:  pascal_area_status {names} {-control_args}


Function:  Displays attributes of specified Pascal areas.
These areas are temporary segments.  Allocation is performed by the
Pascal "new" statement, deallocation by the "dispose" and "reset"
statements.


Arguments:
names
   are relative pathnames of Pascal object segments that have their own
   private areas.  (See the pascal_create_area command.)


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   operates on all private Pascal areas as well as on the default
   Pascal area.
-brief, -bf
   does not print a dump of each allocated block. (Default)
-default
   specifies the default area used by Pascal to allocate storage.
-dump
   prints a comprehensive, unformatted dump of the area(s).  This
   control argument is intended for use by the maintainers of the
   Pascal compiler and related software.
-long, -lg
   prints a dump of each allocated block, if -trace is specified.


-no_dump
   does not print a comprehensive dump as printed by -dump. (Default)
-no_status, -nst
   does not print status information.
-no_trace
   does not print the address and length of each block. (Default)
-status, -st
   prints the maximum size, the size occupated my allocated blocks,
   and the maximum possible size for a new allocation.
-trace
   prints the address and length of each block and, if -long is
   specified, an octal dump of each block.


Notes:  Names and control arguments can be present in any order.

If no areas are specified, -default is assumed.  If no actions are
specified, -status is assumed.

In addition, if more than one action is specified, the operations
are performed in the following order

	-status -dump -trace
