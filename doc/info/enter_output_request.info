Syntax as a command:  eor {paths} {-control_args}


Function: submits requests to printer, punch, or plotter queues.  All
control arguments are nonpositional.  Paired control arguments
override one another if both are used in a single command.  You can
also establish personalized default settings for these control
arguments.


Arguments:
paths
   are pathnames of segments or multisegment files to be printed,
   punched, or plotted.  The star convention is accepted.  Null links
   and directories matching a starname are ignored without error.


Control arguments (queuing):
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message printed by -long.
-force, -fc
   forces sufficient access to a file to allow printing, punching, or
   plotting, and adjusts the bit count of segments having a zero bit
   count.
-long, -lg
   prints the  message "J requests submitted; K already in
   REQUEST_TYPE queue N."  (Default)
-name path, -nm path
   submits a request for the single file identified by the pathname.
-no_force, -nfc
   prints an error message for files having a zero bit count and for
   files to which the IO Driver has insufficient access.  (Default)


-number, -nb
   prints line numbers before each line.  The line number and the
   spaces separating it from the line take up 10 spaces.
-no_number, -nnb
   prints each line with no line numbers. (Default)
-plot
   submits requests for plotting on an installation-defined plotting
   device.
-print, -pr
   submits requests for printing.  (Default)
-punch, -pch
   submits requests for punching.


-queue N, -q N
   submits the request to queue N of the request type.  If N is
   "default" (dft), the default priority queue is used.  Some request
   types have fewer than four queues, so the default priority queue
   varies, depending upon the request type.
-request_type STR, -rqt STR
   submits requests to the STR printer, punch, or plotter request
   type.  STR must be one of the request types listed by
   print_request_types.  (Default: printer when printing, punch when
   punching, plotter when plotting)


Control arguments (processing):
-copies N, -cp N
   produces N copies of the printed, punched, or plotted output.  N
   may be any number from 1 to 30 or "default" (dft) to obtain the
   default number of copies.  (Default: 1)
-destination {-control_args} STR, -ds {-control_args} STR
   STR is the destination placed on the banner page of printed output
   or placed in the flip cards of punched output.  See "Control
   arguments (with headings/labels)" for allowed control arguments.
   (Default: submitter's project_id)
-forms STR
   specifies the type of forms to be used when printing a file.
   Currently, standard I/O daemon drivers ignore -forms when
   processing a print request.


-header {-control_args} STR, -he {-control_args} STR
   STR is the heading placed on the banner page of printed output or
   placed in the flip cards of punched output.  See "Control
   arguments (with headings/labels)" for allowed control arguments.
-no_separator, -nsep
   does not include the inner head and tail sheets when multiple copies
   of a request are processed.
-separator, -sep
   includes the inner head and tail sheets.  (Default)


Control arguments (preprocessing):
-defer_until_process_termination, -dupt
   specifies that the request is not processed until the requesting
   process terminates.
-no_defer_until_process_termination, -ndupt
   processes the request normally.  (Default)


Control arguments (postprocessing):
-delete, -dl
   deletes files after they are printed, punched, or plotted.
-no_delete, -ndl
   does not delete files.  (Default)
-no_notify, -nnt
   does not notify the submitter.  (Default)
-notify, -nt
   notifies the submitted after the entry is printed, punched, or
    plotted.


Control arguments (with headings/labels):
   You can use the following control arguments as operands of -header,
   -destination, -top_label, -bottom_label, or -label.
-active_string, -astr
   STR is interpreted as an active string that eor evaluates as each
   request is submitted.  For example, "-he -astr date" uses today's
   date as the heading.  You can use the pathname of the file being
   processed in the active string because STR is evaluated as:
      [do "[STR]" pathname]
   For example,
      -he -astr "date;string -;spe &1"
   produces a heading of "12/15/84 - test".


-equal_name, -enm
   the heading or label is constructed by applying the equals
   convention to STR and the pathname of the file being processed.
   If the STR contains any equal signs (=) or percent characters (%),
   then -equal_name is assumed by default unless -string is given.
   You can give this operand with -active_string to apply the equal
   convention to the evaluated active string.
-string, -str
   treats STR as an ordinary heading or label character string,
   even though it may contain equal signs or begin with a hyphen.
-center
   centers the label string on each printed page.  You can use it only
   with -label, -top_label, and -bottom_label.  (Default: label is
   left justified)


Control arguments (print format):
-end_page, -ep
   skips to the top of the next page after P lines are printed on a
   page.  (Default)
-fold
   continues lines longer than L-I columns on subsequent print
   lines.  (Default)
-indent I, -ind I
   indents the left margin by I columns.  I can be any number from
   0 to L (the line length) or it can be "default" (dft) to obtain the
   default indentation.  (Default: 0)
-line_length L, -ll L
   prints no more than L columns per line.  L can be any number from 1
   to 136, or it can be "default" (dft) to obtain the default line
   length.  (Default: varies depending upon the request type)

-no_end_page, -nep
   skips to the top of the page only when a formfeed (newpage)
   character is encountered in the input.  Use of -no_end_page
   disables -page_length.
-page_length P, -pl P
   prints no more than P lines per page, where P is the logical page
   length (i.e., the number of lines of user data to appear).  P can
   be "default" (dft) to obtain the default page length, which varies
   depending upon the request type.
-truncate, -tc
   truncates lines longer than L-I columns.


Control arguments (print output conversion):
-edited, -ed
   suppresses printing of nonprintable characters.  (Default)
-non_edited, -ned
   prints nonprintable control characters as octal escape sequences.
-no_vertical_space, -nvertsp
   treats formfeed and vertical-tab characters as newline characters
   during printing.
-vertical_space, -vertsp
   performs formfeed and vertical tabbing operations during printing.
   (Default)


Control arguments (page labels):
-access_label, -albl
   puts the access class of the entry being printed at the top and
   bottom of every page; for entries at system_low access class, this
   is equivalent to -no_label.  (Default)
-bottom_label {-control_args} STR, -blbl {-control_args} STR
   puts STR at the bottom of every page.  See "Control
   arguments (with headings/labels)" for allowed control arguments.
-label {-control_args} STR, -lbl {-control_args} STR
   puts STR at the top and bottom of every page.  See "Control
   arguments (with headings/labels)" for allowed control arguments.


-no_label, -nlbl
   does not put labels on each page.
-top_label {-control_args} STR, -tlbl {-control_args} STR
   puts STR at the top of every page.  See "Control
   arguments (with headings/labels)" for allowed control arguments.


Control arguments (punch output conversion):
-7punch, -7p
   punches files using 7-punch conversion.
-mcc_punch, -mcc
   punches files using character conversion.  (Default)
-raw_punch, -raw
   punches files using no conversion.


Control arguments (set/print defaults):
   (See "Notes on setting defaults" below.)
-all, -a
   prints the control argument values associated with all defined
   groups (-print_defaults is assumed).
-default_name STR, -dnm STR
   uses STR as the name for the group of default control arguments
   being set.  Use -default_name when the name of the new group
   differs from the request type defined by the group.
-delete_defaults, -ddft
   deletes the definition of the named group of control argument
   settings.
-list_defaults, -ldft
   lists the names of the print, punch, and plot defaults that have
   been defined.


-print_defaults, -pdft
   prints the default control argument settings associated with a given
   request type or named group of defaults.
-replace_defaults, -rdft
   resets control argument settings in the group to their standard
   values and then applies the specified control arguments to modify
   the group.
-set_defaults, -sdft
   adds control arguments given in the command line to the existing
   default values.
-set_default_request_type STR, -sdrqt STR
   sets the default request type for printing, punching, or plotting to
   STR.


Access required: The IO Daemon process that performs the printing or
punching must have at least r access to the entry and at least s
access to the directory that contains the entry.  Use the
print_request_types command to print the access name of IO Daemon
processes.

If you give -delete, the IO coordinator (normally IO.SysDaemon.z) must
have at least m access to the directory that contains the entry.


Notes: If you invoke eor without arguments, it gives the number of
requests in the default printer queue.


Notes on setting defaults: The various user-defined groups of default
control values are stored in your default value segment (normally
[hd]>[your name].value).
