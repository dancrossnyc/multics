This segment describes the Multics Pascal implementation, as regards
those features listed in the ISO standard as "implementation defined"
or "implementation dependent".


Implementation defined:

Alternate subscript brackets
   "(." is a synonym of "[" and ".)" is a synonym of "]".

Alternate comment delimiters
   "{" is a synonym of "(*" and "}" is a synonym of "*)".

The maximum positive integer is 34359738367.

Reals can be printed with a precision of 19 digits.

The character internal code is ASCII.

The default width for integer printing is 12 characters.

The default width for printing reals is 24 characters.
          ("-X.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXE-XX")


Implementation dependant:

Evaluation order of [a, b, c] is-- a, b, c.

In logical expressions, ALL terms are evaluated, from left to right.
(Example: a OR b OR c).

Value parameters passed to a procedure or a function are evaluated from
the leftmost to the rightmost.

The PAGE procedure outputs one character (ASCII page code octal 014).

The line separator in text files is the ASCII new line character
(octal 012).
