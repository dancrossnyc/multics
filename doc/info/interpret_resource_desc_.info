:Entry:  interpret_resource_desc_: 02/07/83  interpret_resource_desc_


Function: provides a facility for displaying the contents of an RCP
resource description, in a format similar to that used by the
resource_status command.


Syntax:
declare interpret_resource_desc_ entry (pointer, fixed bin, char(*),
     bit(36) aligned, bit(1) aligned, char(*) varying, fixed bin(35));
call interpret_resource_desc_ (resource_desc_ptr, nth, callername,
     string (rst_control), return_noprint, return_string, code);


Arguments:
resource_desc_ptr
   is a pointer to the structure containing the RCP resource
   description to be displayed.  (See the resource_control_
   subroutine.)  (Input)
nth
   specifies which element of the resource description is to be
   displayed (the index to the array resource_descriptions.item).  If
   nth is zero, all elements will be displayed.  (Input)
callername
   is the name of the command invoking interpret_resource_desc_.  It is
   used in printing any necessary error messages.  (Input)
rst_control
   is declared in the include file rst_control.incl.pl1.  (See "Display
   Control" below.)  (Input)


return_noprint
   specifies, if "0"b, that information about the resource description
   is to be written to the user_output I/O switch.  If "1"b, the
   information is returned in return_string, nth must not be zero, and
   the elements of the structure rst_control must be set so that
   exactly one item of information is requested.  (Input)
return_string
   contains, if return_noprint is "1"b, a printable representation of
   the information requested.  Otherwise, its contents are undefined.
   (Output)
code
   is a standard status code.  (Output)


Display Control:
The rst_control structure (declared in the include file
rst_control.incl.pl1) is defined as follows:
   dcl 1 rst_control             aligned,
         2 default               bit (1) unaligned,
         2 name                  bit (1) unaligned,
         2 uid                   bit (1) unaligned,
         2 potential_attributes  bit (1) unaligned,
         2 attributes            bit (1) unaligned,
         2 desired_attributes    bit (1) unaligned,
         2 potential_aim_range   bit (1) unaligned,
         2 aim_range             bit (1) unaligned,
         2 owner                 bit (1) unaligned,
         2 acs_path              bit (1) unaligned,
         2 location              bit (1) unaligned,
         2 comment               bit (1) unaligned,
         2 charge_type           bit (1) unaligned,
         2 mode                  bit (1) unaligned,
         2 usage_lock            bit (1) unaligned,
         2 release_lock          bit (1) unaligned,
         2 awaiting_clear        bit (1) unaligned,
         2 user_alloc            bit (1) unaligned,
         2 given_flags           bit (1) unaligned,
         2 mbz                   bit (16) unaligned,
         2 any_given_item        bit (1) unaligned;



   Structure elements:
   default
      if "1"b, signifies that certain items of information are to be
      displayed only if they are not in the most common state.  This
      bit should not be used by non-system commands.
   name
      is "1"b if item.name is to be displayed.
   uid
      is "1"b if item.uid is to be displayed.
   potential_attributes
      is "1"b if item.potential_attributes is to be displayed.
   attributes
      is "1"b if item.attributes is to be displayed.
   desired_attributes
      is "1"b if item.desired_attributes is to be displayed.


   potential_aim_range
      is "1"b if item.potential_aim_range is to be displayed.
   aim_range
      is "1"b if item.aim_range is to be displayed.
   owner
      is "1"b if item.owner is to be displayed.
   acs_path
      is "1"b if item.acs_path is to be displayed.
   location
      is "1"b if item.location is to be displayed.
   comment
      is "1"b if item.comment is to be displayed.
   charge_type
      is "1"b if item.charge_type is to be displayed.
   mode
      is "1"b if item.mode is to be displayed.


   usage_lock
      is "1"b if item.usage_lock is to be displayed.
   release_lock
      is "1"b if item.release_lock is to be displayed.
   awaiting_clear
      is "1"b if item.awaiting_clear is to be displayed.
   user_alloc
      is "1"b if item.user_alloc is to be displayed.
   given_flags
      is "1"b if the state of all the flags in the structure item.given
      is to be displayed.
   mbz
      is unused and must be "0"b.
   any_given_item
      is "1"b to display any field in the item structure for which the
      corresponding bit in the item.given structure is "1"b.
