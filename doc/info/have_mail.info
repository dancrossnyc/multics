10/17/84  have_mail

Syntax as a command:  have_mail mbx_specification {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:
   [have_mail {mbx_specification} {-control_args}]


Function: returns "true" if there is mail in the specified mailbox.


Arguments:
mbx_specification
   specifies the mailbox to be examined.  If not given, your default
   mailbox (>udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx) is used.


List of mbx specifications:
-log
   specifies the user's logbox and is equivalent to
      -mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.sv.mbx
-mailbox path, -mbx path
   specifies the pathname of a mailbox.  The suffix mbx is added if
   necessary.
-save path, -sv path
   specifies the pathname of a savebox.  The suffix sv.mbx is added if
   necessary.


-user STR
   specifies either a user's default mailbox or an entry in the system
   mail table (see "Notes on mailbox selection by user" below).
STR
   is any noncontrol argument and is first interpreted as -mailbox STR.
   If no mailbox is found, it is then interpreted as -save.  If no
   savebox is found, it is then interpreted as -user STR.


Control arguments:
-interactive_messages, -im
   returns "true" if there are any interactive messages in the mailbox.
   (Default)
-mail, -ml
   returns "true" if there is any mail in the mailbox.  (Default)
-no_interactive_messages, -nim
   returns "true" only if there is mail in the mailbox, ignoring
   whether there are any interactive messages present.
-no_mail, -nml
   returns "true" only if there are interactive messages in the
   mailbox, ignoring whether there is any mail in the mailbox.


Notes on mailbox selection by user: The user's default mailbox is
specified in the form Person_id.Project_id.  For an entry in the mail
table, STR is usually in the form of Person_id (the mail table is fully
described in the Extended Mail System User's Guide, CH23).


If STR contains one period and no white space, it is interpreted as a
User_id that specifies the user's default mailbox; otherwise, it is
interpreted as the name of an entry in the mail table.  For example,
   -user Smith.SiteSA
is interpreted as a User_id that identifies a default mailbox.  On the
other hand,
   -user "John M. Morton"
   -user J.C.Meade
   -user Meade
are all interpreted as the names of entries in the mail table:  the
first because it contains white space; the second because it contains
more than one period; the third because it contains no period.


When interpreted as a User_id, the STR cannot contain any angle
brackets (<>) and must have the form Person_id.Project_id, where
"Person_id" cannot exceed 28 characters and "Project_id" 32 characters.
In this case, "-user STR" is equivalent to the mbx_specification
-mailbox >udd>Project_id>Person_id>Person_id.mbx.

When interpreted as the name of a mail table entry, STR cannot contain
any commas, colons, semicolons, backslashes (\), parentheses, angle
brackets, braces ({}), quotes, commercial at-signs (@), or white space
other than spaces.  The query of the mail table is performed in a
case-insensitive manner.  Use the display_mailing_address command to
determine the actual address corresponding to the STR.  The address in
the mail table must identify a mailbox.


Access required: If you give either -no_interactive_messages or
-no_mail, you must have rs extended access to the mailbox; otherwise,
you only need s extended access.
