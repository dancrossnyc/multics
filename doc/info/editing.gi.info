02/06/81  Text Editing

Text files on Multics, including source programs for such languages
as PL/I and Fortran, are usually created and modified using one of
the standard system text editors.  The following editors are
supported on the Multics system:

   emacs
      a display-oriented editor designed for use on CRT terminals.
      This editor has a large repertoire of requests for editing and 
      formatting text and programs.  Several modes of operation for
      special applications (e.g., RMAIL, PL/I, FORTRAN) are provided.
      Emacs has extremely powerful features for user customization 
      and program-building.
   qedx
      a straightforward line-oriented editor with a standard 
      complement of requests, including addition and deletion
      of text in multiple buffers and pattern-directed
      substitutions.  This is the standard Multics editor.


   ted
      ted is an extended version of qedx, with many added features
      and powerful added requests.  ted has been designed to 
      facilitate macro-writing, while maintaining compatibility
      with qedx.
   teco
      a character-oriented editor based upon the TECO Editor used
      on Digital Equipment Corporation systems.  Provides a
      repertoire of character-oriented requests designed to
      facilitate editor programming via macro-building.
   edm
      an extremely simple line-oriented editor, presenting a very
      concise command set with a bare minimum of power.  edm may
      be of interest to elementary users of Multics on printing 
      terminals.
