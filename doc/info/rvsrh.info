Syntax as a command:  rvsrh STRA STRB


Syntax as an active function:  rvsrh STRA STRB


Function:  performs the same function as the search command/active
function, but in reverse order.

the last character in STRA that appears in STRB (search returns the
first such character).  If no characters of STRA appear in STRB, 0 is
returned.

   [length STRA] - [search [reverse STRA] STRB] + 1
when a character of STRB appears in STRA.  It is 0 when a character of
STRB does not appear in STRA.
