08/18/76 FAST Subsystem

FAST is a new subsystem that provides a simple-to-use interface for
creating and running BASIC and FORTRAN programs.


Summary:
The FAST subsystem features an integrated command processor and
line-numbered text editor and it contains the new FORTRAN compiler.
FAST is recommended for introducing people to computing and also for
regular users whose needs do not go beyond FORTRAN, BASIC, and/or text
editing facilities using the Multics edm editor.

The  interface is based on a current line-numbered text buffer that may
contain a FORTRAN or BASIC program.  Typing a line beginning with a
line number modifies the text buffer.  A line without a line number is
interpreted as a command.  There are 38 commands; seven are intended
for the beginning user:  login, logout, new (create a new program), old
(use an old program), run, save (save the current text buffer), and
print_text.  Note that explicit compilation of a program is not
required.


Manuals:
The FAST Subsystem is described in "Multics FAST Subsystem Users'
Guide" (Order No. AU25) and the new FORTRAN compiler is described
in "Multics FORTRAN Reference Manual" (Order No. AT58).


Using:
To try the FAST Subsystem, log in under the FAST process overseer:
     l Personid  -po >unb>fst_process_overseer_

In order to set up a Multics FAST user, the project administrator
should set these attributes in the Project Master File (PMF) for each
user who is to use the Multics FAST Subsystem:

  initproc:         fst_process_overseer_;
  attributes:       ^vinitproc,^vdim;
