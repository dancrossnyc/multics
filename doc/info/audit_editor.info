05/12/82  The audit_ editor.

     The audit_ editor is invoked by typing the edit request when
auditing.  The edit request comprising a three character
sequence;

     trigger character || "e" or "E" || new-line

The default trigger character is "!".

Explanation of editor requests:

     The audit editor requests are presented in two categories,
familiar requests and special requests.  The editor syntax is
basically that of qedx.  Any number of requests may be on the
same line and spaces are ignored.

     Addressing, where appropriate, is done the same as in qedx
with two notable exceptions.  First, the "." is a request for
self-identification rather than an indicator for the current
address.  Second, addresses are in terms of entries in the audit
file rather than lines in a buffer.

     If the default search tag is in use, as is the case unless
specifically defeated, the absolute entry number refers to the
number of entries with the default search tag from the beginning
of the file.  Similarly, a relative entry address refers to the
number of entries with the default search tag before or after
the current address.


Addressing:

     An address can consist of one or more of the following three
types of address, the relative address, the absolute address, and
the search address.

     An absolute address refers to an entry by its entry number.
This entry number is determined by counting, from the beginning
of the file, the number of entries which match the default search
tag.  The use of a colon (":") means every entry is counted.

     A relative address is a number preceded by either a "+" or a
"-". It refers to the entry which is the specified number of
entries with the default search tag before , "-", or after, "+",
the entry currently in the edit buffer.

     A search address is a regular expression which may be
preceded by a less-than ("<").  A regular expression is a
character string beginning and ending with a slash ("/").  A
search address which is a regular expression alone refers to the
next entry in the file after the one currently in the edit
buffer, which contains a match for the regular expression.

     A search address which comprises a regular expression
preceded by a less-than, "<", does a backward search for the
first entry previous to the current entry containing a match for
the regular expression.  N is a positive integer, and /REGEXP/
is a regular expression.  The three types of addresses and their
variations are: N -N +N /REGEXP/ </REGEXP/


Familiar Requests:

[[ADR1,]ADR2]p                print

            print the addressed entries.

s/REGEXP/STRING/              substitute

            replace occurrences of REGEXP in the edit buffer with
            STRING.

ADR                           location

            locate the addressed entry.  If ADR is not followed
            by a request the edit buffer is printed.  An ADR can
            contain an absolute entry reference at its beginning,
            relative addresses in any portion, and regular
            expressions in any portion.  An absolute address is
            either a number or the dollar-sign (to indicate the
            last entry in the audit file.

..STRING			execute

            pass STRING to command processor and return to the
            audit editor.

q                             quit

            quits the audit_ editor.

=			print current entry number

	  print the entry number associated with the current
	  position in the audit file.  The value of the entry
	  number for the current position can change with
	  different default search tags.  See the ":" and "d"
	  requests below.


Special requests:

:                             defeat default search tag

            look at every entry, regardless of entry class (or
            tag).  only effective for requests following it and
            on the same request line.

?	(or .?)		list editor requests

            list the editor requests and a brief description of
            their function.

expand 	(or .expand)	expand abbrev

            abbrev expand the edit buffer.

off	(or .off)		audit off

            don't audit input and output in the editor.

on	(or .on)		audit on

            audit the editor.

l	(or .l)		last returned line

            address the last line returned by the audit editor.

r[STRING]	(or .r[STRING])	return line

            return the rest of the request line, if non-null.
            Otherwise, return the edit buffer (without trigger
            sequence).

n	(or .n)		return new-line

            returns a new-line character.

type	(or .type)	print type

            print the audit entry type of the current position.

exec	(or  .exec)	execute

            pass the edit buffer to the command processor and
            return to the audit editor.

d/STRING/	(or .d/STRING/)	default search tag

            set the default search tag to STRING.  If STRING is
            only one character, then only the first character of
            the tag is used to determine if an entry is seen (in
            counting entries and doing searches).  If STRING is
            two characters, the match is done one both characters
            of the tag.



Notes:
     The audit_ editor may be invoked while in the audit_ editor,
if the editor is  being audited.  For every level of the editor,
there is a remembered last returned line distinct from all other
remembered last returned lines.

     There is also a position in the audit file associated with
the last returned line.  This position is the location that the
last returned line was recorded (this position exists since last
returned lines are audited).  The "l" request sets the current
position to be this associated position.  It is important to
note that this position (or entry) is distinct from wherever the
original copy of the last returned line(the one which was edited
to produce the last returned line) was located.
