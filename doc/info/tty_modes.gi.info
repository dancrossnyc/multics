01/11/82	Modes Operation

The following list of modes are recognized by the tty_ I/O module,
set_tty command and the modes preaccess request.  The modes operation
to tty_ is supported when the I/O switch is open.

Some modes have a complement indicated by the circumflex character
(^) that turns the mode off (e.g., ^erkl).  For these modes the
complement is displayed with the mode.  Normal defaults are indicated
for those modes that are generally independent of terminal type.  The
modes string is processed from left to right.  Thus, if two or more
contradictory modes appear within the same modes string, the rightmost
mode prevails.


List of modes:
8bit, ^8bit
   causes input characters to be received without removing the 8th
   (high-order) bit, which is normally interpreted as a parity bit.
   This mode is valid for HSLA channels only.  (Default is off.)
blk_xfer, ^blk_xfer
   specifies that the user's terminal is capable of transmitting a
   block or "frame" of input all at once in response to a single
   keystroke.  The system may not handle such input correctly unless
   blk_xfer mode is on and the set_framing_chars order has seen issued.
   (Default is off.)
breakall, ^breakall
   enables a mode in which all characters are assumed to be break
   characters, making each character available to the user process as
   soon as it is typed.  This mode only affects get_chars operations.
   (Default is off.)


can, ^can
   performs standard canonicalization on input.  (Default is on.)
can_type=overstrike, can_type=replace
   specifies the method to be used to convert an input string to
   canonical form.	Canonicalization is only performed when the I/O
   switch is in "can" mode.  (Default is can_type=overstrike.)
capo, ^capo
   outputs all lowercase letters in uppercase.  If edited mode is on,
   uppercase letters are printed normally; if edited mode is off and
   capo mode is on, uppercase letters are preceded by an escape (\)
   character.  (Default is off.)
crecho, ^crecho
   echoes a carriage return when a line feed is typed.  This mode can
   only be used with terminals and line types capable of receiving and
   transmitting simultaneously.


ctl_char, ^ctl_char
   specifies that ASCII control characters that do not cause carriage
   or paper motion are to be accepted as input, except for the NUL
   character.  If the mode is off, all such characters are discarded.
   (Default is off.)
default
   is a shorthand way of specifying erkl, can, ^rawi, ^rawo, ^wake_tbl,
   and esc.  The settings for other modes are not affected.
echoplex, ^echoplex
   echoes all characters typed on the terminal.  The same restriction
   applies as for crecho; it must also be possible to disable the
   terminal's local copy function.


edited, ^edited
   suppresses printing of characters for which there is no defined
   Multics equivalent on the device referenced.  If edited mode is off,
   the 9-bit octal representation of the character is printed.
   (Default is off.)
erkl, ^erkl
   performs "erase" and "kill" processing on input.  (Default is on.)
esc, ^esc
   enables escape processing on all input read from the device.
   (Default is on.)
force
   specifies that if the modes string contains unrecognized or invalid
   modes, they are to be ignored and any valid modes are to be set.  If
   force is not specified, invalid modes cause an error code to be
   returned, and no modes are set.


fulldpx, ^fulldpx
   allows the terminal to receive and transmit simultaneously.  This
   mode should be explicitly enabled before enabling echoplex mode.
hndlquit, ^hndlquit
   echoes a newline character and performs a resetread of the
   associated stream when a quit signal is detected.  (Default is on.)
iflow, ^iflow
   specifies that input flow control characters are to be recognized
   and/or sent to the terminal.  The characters must be set before
   iflow mode can be turned on.
init
   sets all switch type modes off, sets line length to 50, and sets
   page length to zero.


lfecho, ^lfecho
   echoes and inserts a line feed in the user's input stream when a
   carriage return is typed.	The same restriction applies as for
   crecho.
llN, ^ll
   specifies the length in character positions of a terminal line.  If
   an attempt is made to output a line longer than this length, the
   excess characters are placed on the next line.	 If ^ll is specified,
   line length checking is disabled.  In this case, if a line of more
   than 255 column positions is output by a single call to
   iox_$put_chars, some extra white space may appear on the terminal.


no_outp, ^no_outp
   causes output characters to be sent to the terminal without the
   addition of parity bits.  If this mode and rawo mode are on, any
   8-bit pattern can be sent to the terminal.  This mode is valid for
   HSLA channels only.  (Default is off.)
oddp, ^oddp
   causes any parity generation that is done to the channel to assume
   odd parity.  Otherwise, even parity is assumed for line types other
   than 2741 and 1050.  This mode is valid for HSLA channels only.
   (Default is off.)
oflow, ^oflow
   specifies that output flow control characters are to be recognized
   when sent by the terminal.	 The characters and the protocol to be
   used must be set before oflow mode can be turned on.


plN, ^pl
   specifies the length in lines of a page.  When an attempt is made
   to exceed this length, a warning message is printed.  When the
   user types a formfeed or newline character (any break character),
   the output continues with the next page.  the warning message is
   normally the string "EOP", but can be changed by means of the
   set_special control order.  The string is displayed on a new line
   after N consecutive output lines are sent to the screen (including
   long lines which are folded as more than one output line).  To have
   the end-of-page string displayed on the screen without scrolling
   lines off the top, N should be set to one less than the page length
   capability of the screen, unless the end-of-page string is a null
   string.  In this case, output stops at the end of the last line of
   the page or screen.  If ^pl is specified, end-of-page checking is
   disabled.  (See description of scroll mode below.)
polite, ^polite
   does not print output sent to the terminal while the user is typing
   input until the carriage is at the left margin, unless the user
   allows 30 seconds to pass without typing a newline.  (Default is
   off.)


prefixnl, ^prefixnl
   controls what happens when terminal output interrupts a partially
   complete input line.  In prefixnl mode, a newline character is
   inserted in order to start the output at the left margin; in
   ^prefixnl mode, the output starts in the current column position.
   (Default is on.)	 Polite mode controls when input may be interrupted
   by output; prefixnl controls what happens when such an interruption
   occurs.
rawi, ^rawi
   reads the data specified from the device directly without any
   conversion or processing.	(Default is off.)
rawo, ^rawo
   writes data to the device directly without any conversion or
   processing.  (Default is off.)


red, ^red
   sends red and black shifts to the terminal.
replay, ^replay
   prints any partial input line that is interrupted by output at the
   conclusion of the output, and leaves the carriage in the same
   position as when the interruption occurred.  (Default is off.)
scroll, ^scroll
   specifies that end-of-page checking is performed in a manner suited
   to scrolling video terminals.  If the mode is on, the end-of-page
   condition occurs only when a full page of output is displayed
   without intervening input lines.  The mode is ignored whenever
   end-of-page checking is disabled.  (Default is off.)
tabecho, ^tabecho
   echoes the appropriate number of spaces when a horizontal tab is
   typed.	 The same restriction applies as for crecho.


tabs, ^tabs
   inserts tabs in output in place of spaces when appropriate.  If tabs
   mode is off, all tab characters are mapped into the appropriate
   number of spaces.
vertsp, ^vertsp
   performs the vertical tab and formfeed functions, and sends
   appropriate characters to the device.  Otherwise, such characters
   are escaped.  (Default is off.)
wake_tbl, ^wake_tbl
   causes input wakeups to occur only when specified wakeup characters
   are received.  Wakeup characters are defined by the set_wakeup_table
   order.	 This mode is ineffective unless breakall mode is also on.
   This mode cannot be set unless a wakeup table has been previously
   defined.
