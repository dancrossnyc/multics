Syntax:  wsterm {control arguments}


Function: Invokes the MOWSE terminal manager (WSTERM) on the PC.


Control arguments:

/A Audit_filename
    Specifies the name of the file to log data to when auditing to file
    is enabled. (Default is WSTERM.LOG)

/B
    Specifies that ^BREAK is used to send a line break to the host.
    The default, if this argument is omitted, is to have ^BREAK
    handled on the PC by the system break interrupt handler.

/P Printer_port
   Specifies the printer card to use when auditing to line printer is
   enabled. Valid values are 0 thru 2. (Default is printer card 0.)


List of local escape sequences:

   WSTERM supports a number of escape sequences to perform local
   actions (on the PC) while it is communicating with Multics.  These
   are:

ALT-0 (ALT "zero"), ^@
   Send an ASCII NUL to Multics.

ALT-B
   Send a line break to Multics.

^BREAK
   Send a line break to Multics if the /B control argument is specified.

ALT-C
   Clear the screen.


ALT-D
   Display a pending foreground message and replay any partial
   input line.  In the background screen, display the next
   pending background message if it exists.

ALT-M
   Switch to background screen.

ALT-H
   Switch to the help screen.

ALT-Q
   Exit WSTERM, that is, return to DOS command level.

ALT-S
   Suspend the screen. Hitting any key will resume displaying.


Notes on display management:

   WSTERM uses the first 24 lines of the screen as the main working
   area and the 25th line as a "status line" for local displays.
   WSTERM maintains multiple screens. Normally, WSTERM displays
   terminal data to and from the host. However, a user may switch
   to other screens to look at background messages, help information
   or command history. When the user exits these other screens,
   the normal terminal screen is restored.

   Background messages are not displayed immediately; instead their
   arrival is signalled in the status line and local escape sequences
   are provided to control their display.  See ALT-M and ALT-D above.


   While in asynchronous packet mode (i.e., after entering "atm" but
   not in video or emacs), if a foreground message arrives while you
   are typing, it, too, is not displayed immediately, but is signalled
   in the status line. Entering ALT-D will cause the message to
   overwrite the input line display (in case the message is a prompt
   string) and your partial input line to be redisplayed.


List of operation modes:

Edit mode - ALT-E
   When edit mode is toggled on, a number of local input editing and
   history functions are turned on. These include cursor movement keys,
   a keyboard insert/replace mode, delete and yanking capabilities,
   and history recall and editing of previously entered input lines.
   (See List of editing functions.) When edit mode is off, only the
   erase and kill functions are enabled. Note that in edit mode, input
   is echoed locally. (The default for edit mode is OFF when MOWSE has
   not been attached. Edit mode is always enabled in asynchronous
   packet mode.)

File audit - ALT-F
   Any terminal data displayed on the screen will be saved to a file
   if file audit is on. The name of this file may be specified by the
   /A command line argument. Hitting ALT-F toggles file auditing
   on/off. Each time file audit is toggled on, an audit header line
   will be written to the file as well. (The default is OFF.)


Printer audit - ALT-P
   Any terminal data displayed on the screen will be sent to a line
   printer if printer audit is on. The printer card to use may be
   specified by the /P command line argument. Hitting ALT-P toggles
   printer auditing on/off. Each time printer audit is toggled on, an
   audit header line will be written to the file as well. (The default
   is OFF.)


Local paging - ALT-O
   When local paging is on, displaying will cease when a full screen
   of data has been accumulated without any keyboard input and a "EOP"
   will be displayed. Displaying will resume when the return key (or
   ENTER key) is pressed. When local paging is off, scrolling will not
   be controlled. It may be desirable to toggle local paging off when
   in an audit mode. (The default is ON.)


Keyboard input - ALT-I,<INS>
   Keyboard input mode can be toggled between REPLACE and INSERT. When
   in replace mode, text entered from the keyboard will over-strike
   existing text to the right of the cursor. When in INSERT mode, text
   entered from the keyboard will be inserted (i.e. existing text from
   the cursor to the end of the line will be moved to the right to make
   room for the new text). (The default keyboard input mode is
   REPLACE.)


Notes on the status line:

   The status line will display the current state (e.g. whether the mode
   is on or off) of the edit, file audit, printer audit, keyboard and
   local paging modes as well as signal the presence of background or
   foreground messages.


List of editing functions:

^A,<HOME>
   Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.

^E,<END>
   Moves the cursor to the end of the line.

^F,<RIGHT ARROW>
   Moves the cursor one character forward (to the right).

^B,<LEFT ARROW>
   Moves the cursor one character backward (to the left).


esc-F,^<RIGHT_ARROW>
   Moves the cursor forward a word.

esc-B,^<LEFT_ARROW>
   Moves the cursor backward a word.

<DEL>
   Deletes the previous character.

^D
   Deletes the current character.


^T
   Transposes the positions of the previous two characters.

esc-<DEL>
   Deletes to the word or part of the word to the left of the cursor.

esc-D
   Deletes to the word or part of the word to the right of the cursor.

esc-T
   Transposes the position of the previous two words.


esc-C
   Capitalizes the current word.

esc-U
   Upper cases the current word.

esc-L
   Lower cases the current word.

^K
   Kills from the current position to the end of the line.


^Y
   Yanks a word or part of a line that was deleted.

esc-Y

   previously deleted.

^P,<UP ARROW>
   Recall the line entered previous to the one displayed.

^N,<DOWN ARROW>
   Recall the line entered following the one displayed.


ALT-V
   Switch to history screen to display the contents of the history
   buffer. Each history line will be numbered with the most recently
   entered line being 1, the next most recent 2 and so on. Up to
   22 history lines are displayed on the screen.

esc NN ^P
   Select the history line NN from the history buffer. NN corresponds
   to the number associated with history line when ALT-V is pressed.
