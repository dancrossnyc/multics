85-10-10	validate_info_seg, vis

Syntax as a command:  vis paths {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [vis paths {-control_args}]


Function:	 validates the syntax of an info segment.  The active
function returns the number of the highest severity error that
occurs.


Arguments:
paths
   are the pathnames of info segs.  The info suffix need not be
   supplied.  The star convention is allowed.


Control arguments:
-names, -nm
   changes the names on the info segment, if necessary, to match the
   names used in it.
-no_names, -nnm
   does not change the names on the info segment to match the names
   used in it, but merely reports discrepancies.  (Default)
-severity N, -sv N
   suppresses error messages of severity less than N.
-total, -tt
   prints only the total number of errors for each severity, or nothing
   if there are no errors.


Notes on validation: The validate_info_seg (vis) command validates the
syntax of an info segment.  For a description of info segment format,
type "help info_seg.gi".  Error messages printed by vis are of four
severities:
       Severity 4 -- bad errors precluding installation
       Severity 3 -- less important errors
       Severity 2 -- even less important errors
       Severity 1 -- just warnings, such as the existence of
                     nonstandard section headings.
