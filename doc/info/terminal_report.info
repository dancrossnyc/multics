11/19/86 terminal_report

Syntax:  terminal_report -control arguments


Function:  Displays terminal usage on the system based on the information
obtained from the answering service logs.


Control arguments:
-from time, -fm time
   specifies that the first message being examined for terminal data in
   the log is the first message at or after the specified time.  If no
   -from value is specified, the default is the first message in the
   log.  This is incompatible with -last.
-to time
   specifies the last message in the log to be examined for terminal
   data.  If not specified, the default is all the remaining messages
   in the log.  This is incompatible with -for and -last.
-for time
   specifies a time interval relative to the starting time
   (specified by -from) containing the messages to be examined.  This
   is incompatible with -to and -last.


-last time, -lt time
   specifies that only the most recent messages in the given time interval
   are to be examined.  This is incompatible with -to, -from and -for.
-terminal_type name, -ttp name
   specifies that only terminal type data for the terminal type named
   name be displayed.
-all_terminal_types, -att
   specifies that all terminal type data is to be displayed. (Default)
-user name
   specifies that only the terminal type data for the user named name
   be displayed (name is any Person_id).
-all_users, -au
   specifies that terminal type data be displayed for all users for
   which terminal type data was found while examining the log.
   (Default)


-meters, -mt
   specifies that cpu time and connect time meters for the individual
   terminal types, and personids is to be given.
-no_meters, -nmt
   specifies that cpu time and connect time meters is not to be given.
   (Default)
-output_file path, -of path
   directs output to the file whose pathname is path.
-no_output_file, -nof
   specifies that output is to be printed on the terminal. (Default)


Access required:  read permission is required on the log segments
themselves, and status permission is required on their containing
directories.  If an access error is encountered searching for older
logs, the search is stopped at that point, and no further history
will be available.


Notes:
Use of the -meters control argument will substantially increase the
time taken to produce the output.  Much more log searching and checking
must be performed to produce the meter information.


The command displays data in two formats.  First, it displays all
individual terminal type information sorted by terminal types.  Second,
it displays the same information sorted by answerbacks.
