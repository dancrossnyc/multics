11/30/86	preface.compin, pf.compin, pf_cont.compin

Syntax: .ifi preface "copyright-year(s)"
     OR .ifi pf	 "copyright-year(s)"
        .srv file_no "Pubs-catalog-file-number"
and, at the top of the second page (to reset the footers, etc.)  .ifi
        pf_cont


Function:
This compose macro creates a preface for a manual.  It
1) generates a 'Preface' section heading (with no Table of Contents
   entry)
2) generates the page footers for the first and succeeding pages of the
   preface (with a copyright notice and 'Pubs-catalog-file-number' on
   the first page)
3) numbers the Preface pages in lowercase roman, starting with 'iii'
4) adds a legal notice concerning specifications and availability of
   the described product.


5) generates a special notice on the Preface page (ahead of the
   copyright line) of all technical manuals advising the reader of
   possible changes in the information and availability of the
   product described.  This notice may not be typed for a typewritten
   manual, but must be pasted in before printing.  Preface.compin will
   leave one inch of extra space on the preface page to accommodate
   this notice.


Arguments:
'copyright-year(s)' is the copyright year(s) (all 4 digits) for the
   document.
'Pubs-catalog-file-number' is the file reference number given in the
   Publications Catalog.  (For Honeywell use, these numbers will be
   found in Table 1-3 in Part III, "Writing and Editing," of the
   Honeywell Publications Standards.)
'notice' is a specifications disclaimer legal notice will be
   printed at the bottom of the first preface page, ahead of the
   Copyright line.


Examples:
The following could be the preface of the MPM Commands:
        .ifi init_mpm "AG92"
        .srv file_no "1L13"
