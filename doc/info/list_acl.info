02/13/85  list_acl, la

Syntax as a command:  la {path} {User_ids} {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [la {path} {User_ids} {-control_args}]


Function: lists the access control lists (ACLs) of nonlink entries in
a directory.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of an entry.  If it is -working_directory (-wd),
   your working directory is assumed.  The star convention is allowed.
User_ids
   are access control names of the form Person_id.Project_id.tag.  All
   ACL entries with matching names are listed.  If you don't give
   User_ids, the entire ACL is listed.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the message "User name not on ACL of path."  If you
   invoke list_acl as an active function and User_id is not on the ACL,
   the null string is returned.
-chase
   chases links matching a star name.  Links are always chased when
   path is not a star name.
-directory, -dr
   lists the ACLs of directories only (see "Notes" below).  (Default:
   segments, multisegment files, and directories)
-interpret_as_extended_entry, -inaee
   interpret the selected entry as an extended entry type.
-interpret_as_standard_entry, -inase
   interpret the selected entry as a standard entry type.


-no_chase
   does not chase links.  (Default)
-ring_brackets, -rb
   lists the ring brackets.  Not valid in the active function.
-segment, -sm
   lists the ACLs of segments and multisegment files only.
-select_entry_type STR, -slet STR
   affects only entries of the entry type selected by STR, which is a
   comma-delimited list of file system entry types.  Use the
   list_entry_types command to obtain a list of valid entry type
   values.


Access required: You need status permission on the directory.


Notes: This command provides effective access information only when
discretionary access control is being used (regulated by an ACL).  If
either nondiscretionary access control (regulated by the AIM) or
intraprocess access control (regulated by the ring structure) is in
operation, use the status command to determine actual access.

The -directory, -segment, and -select_entry_type control arguments are
used to resolve an ambiguous choice that may occur when path is a star
name.


If you invoke list_acl with no arguments, it lists the entire ACL of
your working directory.

For a description of ACLs and ring brackets, see ACL.gi and the
Programmer's  Reference Manual.  For a description of the matching
strategy, see set_acl.
