Syntax:  ec ffv1 SUBTREE_ROOT {RESULT_DIR}


Function: Searches a subtree in the hierarchy for version 1 forum
meetings and for directories which contain links to version 1 meetings.


Arguments:
SUBTREE_ROOT
   Specifies the root of the portion of the hierarchy to be searched.
RESULT_DIR
   Specifies the directory where the resulting files will be placed.
   See "Notes" for a description of the output of this exec_com.
   If this argument is not specified, the files are placed in the
   working dir.


Notes:
This exec_com uses the walk_subtree command to traverse the hierarchy
subtree.  It produces the following five output files:

MEETINGS:  This is a list of all version 1 meetings found in the
subtree.

LINKS: This is a list of all of the directories containing links to
version 1 meetings found in the subtree.

MEETING_ERRORS:  This is a list of errors encountered while examining a
segment to see if it is a version 1 meeting.  This should be a short
file.

LINK_ERRORS:  This is a list of errors encountered while examining
links to see if they point to version 1 meetings.  Examples include
circular links.

ERRORS:  This is a list of other errors encountered. This consists
mostly of incorrect access to directories.
