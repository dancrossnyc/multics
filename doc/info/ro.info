03/14/85  revert_output, ro

Syntax as a command:  ro {-control_args}


Function: reverts the effect of the file_output, syn_output, and
terminal_output commands, i.e., releases the most recent preceding
command.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   reverts all file_output, syn_output, and terminal_output attachments
   for specified I/O switches or for all switches if you specify none.
-source_switch STR, -ssw STR
   specifies the name of an I/O switch to be redirected.  (Default:
   user_output)


Notes: Each command invocation of file_output, terminal_output, or
syn_output stacks up another attachment for each of the specified
switches.  The revert_output command pops and restores one attachment
from the stack; it does not revert attachments made, for example, by
the io_call command.
