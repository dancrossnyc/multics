Speedtype is similar to the Multics "abbrev" subsystem which expands
command line input.  In order to avoid confusion, so-called
abbreviations are termed "symbols" when discussing Speedtype.


All Speedtype commands use a current symbol dictionary.  The first
time a user executes a Speedtype command the default symbol dictionary
in the user's home directory is defined as the current symbol
dictionary.
