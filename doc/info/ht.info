02/13/85  hash_table, ht

Syntax as a command:  ht path nb


Function: used to create a hash table and to insert, delete, and
search for entries in it.  It uses the hash_ subroutine.


Arguments:
path
   specifies the name of a segment, which is an existing hash table.
nb
   is the (optional) number of buckets with which the hash table is to
   be created.  If you don't give nb or if it is out of range (0 < nb
   <= 6552), then a default is assigned to it.


List of requests: The command operates in response to the following
   requests given by you.  Each request code must be the first
   character of the line and followed by one or more arguments
   separated by any number of blanks (a blank before the first argument
   is optional).
a      add
d      delete
q      quit
s      search


Notes on the a request:


Syntax:  a name1 value1...nameN valueN


Function: inserts an entry into the hash table for namei and its
corresponding valuei.


Arguments:
namei
   is a character string less than, or equal to, 32 characters.
valuei
   is a decimal number you associate with namei to indicate its
   location in the corresponding data table.  It can be array
   subscript.


Notes on the d request:


Syntax:  d name1...nameN


Function: deletes the entry namei from the hash table and prints the
value it was associated with.


Arguments:
namei
   is a character string less than, or equal to, 32 characters.


Notes on the q request:


Syntax:  q


Function: returns control to command level.


Notes on the s request:


Syntax:  s name1...nameN


Function: searches the hash table for namei and prints its
corresponding value.  You can then locate namei in your data table by
using valuei.


Arguments:
namei
   is a character string less than, or equal to, 32 characters.


Notes: If the hash table ever becomes full or inefficient, the number
of buckets is doubled or assigned the maximum, the hash table is
rehashed, and a message is printed.
