         <prefix subscript> rather than a <decimal integer> must  |

         and evaluated to a <decimal integer>.                    |


pg 2-6:  in the section "Bit-string constants", after the
     paragraph beginning with "A <bit-string constant>
     denotes....", add the following.

         The <decimal integer> must be either a decimal integer

     paragraph beginning with "A <character-string constant>
     denotes....", add the following.

         The <decimal integer> must be either a decimal integer

         A variable declared with "options(constant)" may take    |
         the place of a literal constant in declarations (the     |
         scale, precision, initial value, and <extent             |
         expression>, only) and in subscripted label arrays.      |
