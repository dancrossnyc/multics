07/23/84  find_dict_words, fdw

Syntax as a command:  fdw {words} {-control_args}


Function:  The find_dict_words command finds and displays words
contained in the sequence of dictionaries defined by the dict search
list.


Arguments:
words
   are words to be found.  At least one word must be given unless the
   -input_file control argument is specified.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses the warning message usually given when a word is not
   found.
-dictionary, -dict
   displays the pathname of the dictionary in which the word was found.
-exact_match, -exm
   finds only those words that match a dictionary word exactly, i.e.,
   no special processing is performed with respect to capitalization
   (see "Note" below).
-input_file path, -if path
   finds words in the segment specified by path.  Words in this segment
   must be separated by newlines.  This control argument may be
   specified more than once.


-output_file path, -of path
   writes words found into the segment specified by path instead of
   displaying words on the user's terminal.  Words are separated by
   newlines in the output segment.
-raw
   displays the words without indicating the no-trim attribute or
   hyphenation points (see add_dict_words command above).  Otherwise,
   words are printed in the format accepted by add_dict_words.
-word string
   finds the word string even though string may look like a control
   argument.


Notes:  When searching for a word in a dictionary, special processing
of capital letters is performed unless the -exact_match control
argument is specified.  This special processing is identical to that
performed by the trim_wordlist command below.
