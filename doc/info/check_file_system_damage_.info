3/30/84  check_file_system_damage_


Function: checks a single entry for connection failures and damaged switches.


Syntax:
declare check_file_system_damage_ entry (char(*), char(*), fixed bin(35))
        returns (bit(36) aligned);
damage = check_file_system_damage_ (dir_name, entryname, code);


Arguments:
dir_name
   is the pathname of the containing directory.  (Input)
entryname
   is the entryname of the segment.  (Input)
code
   is a storage system status code.  (Output)
damage
   is a bit string.  Bit 0 is set on if any of the other
   bits are set, and indicates that there is apparently some
   damage to the entry.  Bit 1 is set if the entry damaged
   switch is on.  Bit 2 is set on if there is a connection
   failure for the entry.  Bits 3 to 35 are always returned
   off.  If code is non-zero, all bits are returned off.


Note:
damage may also be declared as

   dcl 1 damage unaligned,
         2 any bit (1),
         2 damaged_switch bit (1),
         2 connection_failure bit (1),
         2 unused bit (33);
