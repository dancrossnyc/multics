Syntax as a command:  component path


Syntax as an active function:  [component path]


Function:  returns the archive component name portion of path after it
has been expanded into an absolute pathname.  If an archive component
pathname is not supplied, then this command/active function is
equivalent to entry.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname whose archive component name portion is to be
   returned.


Notes:  Since the pathname is returned in quotes, the command processor
treats it as a single argument regardless of special characters in the
name.
