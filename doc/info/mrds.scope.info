Scope changes:  The scope mode encodings for version 4 databases has changed
for MR9 MRDS.

Previously the values 0, 1, 2 used for the permit and prevent ops in a call to
dsl_$set_scope had meanings of null, retrieve, and update.

Now the encodings have changed.  They are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 with meanings of null,
read_attr, append_tuple, delete_tuple, modify_attr.  These correspond exactly
to the old (pre MR8) encoding meanings of null, read, store, delete, modify.
The names were changed to agree with the new attribute level security access
operation names.

When MR9 MRDS is installed, version 4 database users will not be able to open
their databases until after they have their database administrator do an
"adjust_mrds_db path -reset" on the database.  This operation will convert the
concurrency control mechanism to use the new scope modes.

Pl1 programs that have been running against version 4 databases using the scope
mode encodings for r-u, rather than r-s-m-d of pre MR8 MRDS will have to be
changed.	The users of exec_coms with mrds_call will not have to change.  The u
encoding will still mean all update operations.  In addition, the encodings for
mrds_call will include a (or s), d, and m.  LINUS users will not notice a
change after the adjust_mrds_db is done.

To see if your database is using the latest version scope modes, the command
"display_mrds_db_status path -long" can be used.	The latest concurrency
control version (for the r-a-m-d modes) is version 5.
