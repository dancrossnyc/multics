10/17/81	l0h.compin, l0new.compin

Syntax: .ifi l0h   "title-of-section"
     OR .ifi l0new "title-of-section"

     OR, for numbered sections (see "Section numbering" below)

        .srv section "section-no"
       {.srv style "roman"}
        .ifi l0h   "title-of-section"
     OR .ifi l0new "title-of-section"


Function:
This macro begins a new major section of a document.  It should be
inserted at the beginning of each section.


Arguments:
'title-of-section' is the title of the section as it is to appear in
   the Table of Contents (i.e., first caps, no underlines).	 It is
   translated to the proper font for the section heading on the output
   page.
'section-no' is either a section number (e.g., "2") or an appendix
   letter (e.g., "A").  This value is used (e.g., SECTION 2 or APPENDIX
   A) in a title line preceding the section title line and is used in
   page numbers, figure numbers, and table numbers (e.g., the first
   page, figure, or table number when section-no "2" is 2-1; when
   section-no is "A", A-1).


Macro actions:
1) initializes a new section of a manual
2) generates a one or two line section heading on a new page (see
   "Section numbering" below)
3) sets the page counter to 1
4) adds the section title to the Table of Contents
5) in addition to the above, 'l0new' generates Table of Contents
   change-bars for all level header entries in a newly added section.
   The next use of any of the 'l0' macros other than 'l0new' cancels
   these change-bars.


Section numbering:
If you use numbered sections (i.e., use .srv section "section-no") the
macros automatically use Arabic numbers in the section heading and as
part of the page numbers, figure numbers, and table numbers (e.g.,
2-1).

You can get Roman numerals in the section heading (e.g., SECTION II
preceding the section title line) by using the following line
immediately BEFORE the l0h line
        .srv style "roman"
The section-no portion of the page number, figure number, and table
number will still be Arabic.


Examples:
The first section of the MPM Commands might begin with

        .ifi init_mpm "AG92"
        .srv section "1"
        .ifi l0h "Multics Command Environment"

which yields (in typed output)

			 SECTION 1

		  MULTICS COMMAND ENVIRONMENT


A section of a manual that does not use section numbers might begin
with

        .ifi init "My Manual"
        .ifi l0h "Manual of Instructions"

which yields (in typed out)

		    MANUAL OF INSTRUCTIONS


An appendix of a manual might begin with

        .ifi init "My Manual"
        .srv section "A"
        .ifi l0h "Summary of Operation Properties"

which yields (in typed output)

			APPENDIX A

		SUMMARY OF OPERATION PROPERTIES


Notes:
1) The section title is translated to the proper font when used in the
   section heading.	 Use the l0exact and l0toc macros for section
   titles containing literal strings that should not be translated to
   the Level 0 font.
