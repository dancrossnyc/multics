08/14/84  display_mrds_db_version, dmdv

Syntax as a command:  dmdv path


Function:  This command displays the MRDS data model/submodel version,
creator, and creation time.


Arguments:
path
   is the pathname of the data model/submodel version to be displayed
   (with or without the db or dsm suffix).


Notes:  This command requires access to open the data model or submodel
for retrieval (for example, as in mmi_$open_model or
msmi_$open_submodel).  (See dsl_$get_path_info for a subroutine
interface.)

If a data base model and submodel of the same name are in the same
directory, the model is found if a suffix is not given.
