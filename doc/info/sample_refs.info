10/17/84  sample_refs

Syntax as a command:  sample_refs -control_args


Function:  periodically samples the machine registers to determine
which segments a process is referencing.  Three output segments are
produced that are interpretable by the print_sample_refs command.


Control arguments:
-segment name, -sm name
   specifies the names to be given the three output segments; name can
   be either an absolute or relative pathname.  If name does not end
   with the suffix srf, it is assumed.  The output segments are named
   as follows:
      (entry portion of) name.srf1
      (entry portion of) name.srf2
      (entry portion of) name.srf3


   The default places the output segments in your working directory,
   with entrynames as follows:
      mm/dd/yy__hhmm.m_zzz_www.srf1
      mm/dd/yy__hhmm.m_zzz_www.srf2
      mm/dd/yy__hhmm.m_zzz_www.srf3
-time N, -tm N
   specifies the rate in milliseconds at which the process is sampled.
   N must be a positive integer.  (Default: N = 1000; i.e., the
   process is sampled once every second)


Notes:  You are allowed one active invocation per process--a second
invocation terminates the first, whereupon the new invocation proceeds
normally.

You can sample the machine registers only when the process is running
in a ring other than 0.  For example, a process using a total of 100
seconds of processor time and sample_refs running at the default sample
rate and recording 23 samples indicate that 77 seconds of processor
time were spent in ring 0.

Under certain conditions, the contents of one of the machine registers
sampled--the Temporary Segment Register (TSR)--can be invalid.  This
invalidity is noted, but does not necessarily indicate that the process
is in error.


At the maximum sample rate (one millisecond) execution time can be
increased by as much as 50 percent.  Using a one-second sample rate,
the increase in execution time is negligible.

The accuracy of sample rates less than 1000 milliseconds is not
guaranteed due to load factors.  The accuracy of such sample rates
increases with load.

If the process being sampled is terminated without an invocation of
sample_refs with the -reset option, interpretable output segments are
still produced; however, both the off-time and the last recorded sample
may be invalid.
