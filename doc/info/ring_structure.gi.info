:Info: raw_access.gi: 02/26/82 raw access

     Also referred to as the raw mode, it is the access mode granted a
process to an object by discretionary access control.  Raw access to
an object is computed from the access control list (ACL), ring
brackets, and AIM attributes of the object.  See also access.info.


:Info: ready_message.gi: 02/26/82 ready message

     A message that is printed each time a user is at command level.
Printing this message may be inhibited, or the user may define his or
her own ready message.  The standard system ready message tells the
time of day, the number of CPU seconds and pages of information
brought into main memory since the last ready message, and the current
listener level (if greater than 1).  See the general_ready, ready_on
and ready_off commands.


:Info: record.gi: 02/26/82 record

     The term "record" has two meanings on Multics.  In one sense, it
means the smallest unit of disk allocation, containing 1024 36-bit
words (4096 characters).  In PL/I and FORTRAN, it means a block of
data transferred during input or output.


:Info: recursion.gi: 02/26/82 recursion

     The ability of a procedure to invoke itself.


:Info: reference_name.gi: 02/26/82 reference name

     When a segment is made known to a process, particular names may
be associated with it in that process.  This is called initiation.
Thereafter, a symbolic reference to this reference name is directed to
the associated segment.  Reference names need not be the same as any
of the segment's entrynames.


:Info: relative_pathname.gi: 02/26/82 relative pathname

     A pathname that names a segment in its relation to the working
directory.


:Info: retrieval.gi: 02/10/84 retrieval

   The process of copying a segment or directory back into the storage
system hierarchy from backup tapes.  Multics has two backup systems:
volume and hierarchy.  These backup systems copy segments and
directories from the storage system hierarchy onto tapes at specified
intervals.  When you ask for a retrieval, you are asking the operator
to copy your segment or directory from these tapes back into the
storage system hierarchy.

   The operator can use tapes produced by either backup system to
recover segments and directories.  But the primary functions of the
two kinds of backup tapes are different.  See "Notes on backup tapes"
next.


Notes on backup tapes:

   Volume backup tapes are primarily used for recovery from major
system failures which damage a large portion of the file system.  An
example of this is a head crash which causes physical damage to a disk
pack.  When this happens, all of the segments which reside on the
damaged disk pack must be restored onto a new pack.  Segments are
written to volume backup tapes at frequent intervals.  However, these
tapes are normally retained only for short periods of time, perhaps
two or three weeks, depending on site policy.

   Hierarchy backup tapes are primarily used for long term backup
storage.  Segments are written to hierarchy backup tapes at less
frequent intervals.  However, these tapes are normally retained for
long periods of time, perhaps a year or more, again depending on site
policy.


   The operator normally uses hierarchy backup tapes to recover
individual segments and directories that you yourself have deleted or
which have been damaged during a system crash (hardware, software or
power failure).

   In addition to the fact that hierarchy tapes are retained longer,
there is another major reason why they are usually used for individual
retrievals.  User segments are in sequential order on hierarchy tapes.
They are not in sequential order on volume tapes, and in fact, may be
spread over MANY tapes.  Thus, fewer hierarchy tapes than volume tapes
need to be mounted to do a retrieval.


   The procedure for requesting a retrieval varies.  Your site should
have its own help file spelling out its policy on requesting
retrievals and explaining its schedule of when backup tapes are
created.  This help file should be kept in the directory called
>doc>installation_info_segs (>doc>iis).  If your site doesn't have a
help file like this, please check with your System Administrator for
the correct, exact procedure to follow at your site.  Usually, the
procedure involves sending mail to the operator.  See "Notes on
sending mail to operator" next.


Notes on sending mail to operator:

   When you send mail to the operator, you should include the complete
pathname(s) of the segment(s)/directory(ies) you want retrieved, and
the approximate date and time they were last modified.

   Be sure to type the pathnames correctly, using capital letters when
required.  Use primary names of segments and directories, not
add_names, because that makes it easier for the operator to find your
files.

   If you are not certain of the date and time the version of the
segment/directory you want to retrieve was modified, give the operator
a range of dates and times within which you believe it was modified
(e.g.: modified between May 16 and June 1; modified yesterday between
1230 and 1400).  See "Examples of sending mail to operator" below.


   The operator will determine which (if any) backup system produced
the tape copy of the segment or directory you want to retrieve.
Whether or not your segment/directory can be retrieved depends on when
and how long it was on the system, and what the backup schedule in
place at your site is like.

   To understand the backup schedule, you need to know more about the
backup systems.  See "Notes on backup systems" next.


Notes on backup systems:

   The procedure by which the volume and hierarchy backup systems copy
segments and directories from the storage system hierarchy onto tape
is called dumping.  The segments and directories selected for dumping
are determined by the mode -- incremental, consolidated, or complete
-- in which the dumping is performed.


   An incremental dump locates and copies all segments and directories
which have been created or modified since the last time an incremental
dump was done.  Its main function is to limit the amount of
information that can be lost due to changes that have been made since
the last incremental tape was created.

   A consolidated dump locates and copies all segments and directories
which have been modified after some specified time in the past.  Its
main function is to consolidate the most recent information stored on
a group of incremental tapes, thus decreasing the number of tapes
which must be saved and processed.  It does this by copying all
segments which have been modified since the last consolidated dump.


   A complete dump locates and copies every segment and directory in
the storage system without regard for when they were last modified.
Its main function is to establish a checkpoint in time.  If it's ever
necessary to recover a major portion of online storage, the tape with
the most recent complete dump on it marks a cutoff point, beyond which
no older dump tapes are needed.

   Now you have enough background to understand a backup schedule.
See "Examples of backup schedule" next.


Examples of backup schedule:

   The following example shows a schedule of when different backup
procedures could be run and how long the tapes they produce could be
held.  Keep in mind that some sites only run one of the backup
systems, not both of them.  Also keep in mind that segments and
directories are only copied to incremental and consolidated backup
tapes when they are newly created or when they have been modified.


   procedure                 interval            retention

   Hierarchy Incremental     every 12 hours      2 weeks

   Hierarchy Consolidated    every Saturday      1 year

   Hierarchy Complete        end of month        1 year
                             (normally between
                              26th and 30th)

   Volume Incremental        hourly              7 days

   Volume Consolidated       daily (1800 hrs)    7 days

   Volume Complete           7 days              14 days


Notes on backup schedule:

   The first three procedures shown in the example provide long term
backup protection of the file system.  The tapes they produce are the
ones the operator normally uses for retrieving user segments and
directories.

   The last three procedures shown in the example provide a method of
recovering from major system crashes which damage the file system.
The tapes they produce are mainly used for rebuilding physical volumes
(disk packs) after they are destroyed by head crashes and have to be
replaced.  However, the tapes they produce can also be used to recover
individual segments or directories.


Examples of sending mail to operator:

   sdm Operator
   Subject: retrieval request
   Message:
   Please retrieve the following files:


   1.   >udd>Mcc>Johnson>test_A.fortran
        modified yesterday morning
        between 800 and 1000

   2.   >udd>Mcc>Johnson>file_B
        modified 1st week in February and
        deleted from system sometime in Apr.

   3.   >udd>Mcc>Johnson>file_C
        created four weeks ago last Tuesday and
        deleted  the following day.

   4.   >udd>Mcc>Johnson>PLI  (directory)
        as it was the end of Nov - 9 months ago.
   .


   If the schedule shown above under "Examples of backup schedule" was
the one being used, the operator would be able to retrieve all of the
segments and directories in this example except for # 3.  Since # 3
was only on the system for one day, it was only captured on short term
retention tapes that are overwritten in 2 to 3 weeks.  If the
retrieval request had been made within two weeks, the operator would
have been able to retrieve the segment.


   If your site allows users to use the enter_retrieval_request
command, you should refer to the description of that command.
Remember that you can only use it to do a VOLUME retrieval.  It
doesn't work for a hierarchy retrieval.


:Info: ring.gi: 02/26/82 ring

     A particular level of privilege at which programs may execute.
Lower numbered rings are of higher privilege than higher numbered
ones.  The supervisor program runs in ring 0, most user programs run
in ring 4.


:Info: ring_brackets.gi: 02/26/82 ring brackets

     A set of integers associated with each segment that define in
what rings that segment may be written, read, called, or executed.


:Info: ring_structure.gi: 03/05/82 ring structure

     The structure of access control on Multics which is implemented
by special hardware.  Operation is controlled in such a way that the
computer's work is done in a number of mutually exclusive subsets.
These subsets may be considered concentric rings of privilege,
representing different levels of access rights.  The innermost or
hardcore ring is made up of those segments essential to all users.
This innermost ring, designated as ring 0, represents the highest
level of privilege.  The work of most users is done in ring 4.  Ring 7
is the ring of least privilege.


:Info: root.gi: 02/26/82 root

     The directory that is the base of the directory hierarchy.  All
other directories are subordinate to it.  It has an absolute pathname
of >.
