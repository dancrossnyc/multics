11/10/86  object_segments, obsegs

Syntax as a command:  obsegs star_names {-control_args}


Syntax as an active function:  [obsegs star_names {-control_args}]


Function:  returns the entrynames or absolute pathnames of segments
that are executable object segments and that match one or more star
names.


Arguments:
star_names
   are star names to be used in selecting the names to be returned.


Control arguments:
-absolute_pathname, -absp
   returns absolute pathnames rather than entrynames.
-chase
   will process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
-inhibit_error, -ihe
   returns false if a star_name is an invalid name or if access to tell
   of an entry's existence is lacking.
-no_chase
   will not process the targets of links when a starname is specified.
   (Default)
-no_inhibit_error, -nihe
   signals an error if a star_name is an invalid name or if access to
   tell of an entry's existence is lacking.  (Default)


Notes:  Only one name per segment is returned; i.e., if a segment has
more than one name that matches star_name, only the first match found
is returned.


Since each entryname (or pathname) returned by object_segments is
enclosed in quotes, the command processor treats each name as a single
argument regardless of the presence of special characters in the name.


Segments that the user does not have at least r access to are ignored,
since r access is needed to determine if the file is an object segment.
