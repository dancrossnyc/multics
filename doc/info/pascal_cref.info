01/14/87  pascal_cross_reference, pascal_cref

Syntax as a command:  pascal_cref pathnames {-control_args}


Function:  examines a set of Pascal object segments that import
variables and procedures.


Arguments:
pathnames
   are absolute or relative pathnames of Pascal object segments.  They
   must have been compiled with -table.


Control arguments:
-external_references, -ext_refs
   includes line numbers of statements where external (i.e., imported
   or exported) variables and procedures are referenced or set.  The
   modules must have been compiled with -reference_table to include
   this information.
-internal_references, -int_refs
   includes a list of internal variables or procedures and line numbers
   of statements where they are referenced or modified.  The modules
   must have been compiled with -reference_table to include this
   information.
-no_external_references, -no_ext_refs
   excludes line numbers of statements where external variables and
   procedures are referenced.  (Default)
-no_internal_references, -no_int_refs
   excludes a list of internal variables and procedures.  (Default)
-output_file path, -of path
   produces a listing named path.x_map.  If you use no .x_map suffix as
   part of the pathname, it is assumed.  You must specify -of to get a
   cross-reference list including include files used and error
   reporting; otherwise the command writes any error or warning
   messages on error_output.


Notes:  The modules must have been compiled with -table.  The
cross-referencer checks declarations of shared variables and
procedures, producing an error list of differences between modules.  It
also notes if the difference may have undesirable results, for example,
destruction of data outside the program, such as may occur when sizes
of shared objects do not match.  Warnings are printed if types do not
match but object sizes do.

Unlike the cross_reference command, pascal_cref includes no
declarations of variables and procedures in the listing, nor does it
compare types.  It accepts no modules generated by other translators.
