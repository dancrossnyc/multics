05/27/88  canonicalize, canon

Syntax as a command:  canon path1 {path2} {-control_args}


Function:  ensures that the contents of a single segment (SSF) or
a multisegment file (MSF) are in canonical form.


Arguments:
path1
   is the pathname of the input single segment or multisegment file.
path2
   is the pathname of the output single segment or multisegment file.
   If path2 is omitted, path1 is overwritten with the canonicalized
   contents of the input single segment or multisegment file.


Control arguments:
-force, -fc
   causes the output file to be overwritten without querying.
-no_force, -nfc
   causes canonicalize to query before overwriting an existing
   segment.  (Default)
-input_tabs -every X, -itabs -ev X
   replaces tabs with the appropriate number of spaces, assuming that
   tabs stops are at 1+n*X (where n= 1, 2, 3, ...).
-input_tabs n1,n2,...,n20, -itabs n1,n2,...,n20
   replaces tabs with the appropriate number of spaces, assuming that
   tab stops are as specified.


-output_tabs -every X, -otabs -ev X
   inserts tabs at 1+n*X (where n= 1, 2, 3, ...).
-output_tabs n1,n2,...,n20, -otabs n1,n2,...,n20
   inserts tabs at the tab stops specified.  Up to 20 tab stops can be
   given.  No spaces are allowed in the list.
-no_output_tabs, -notabs
   does not insert tabs into output.  (Default)


-temp_file PATH, -tf PATH
   specifies the temporary file used to build the canonicalized data
   during operation of the command.  By default, canon uses a uniquely
   named file in the process directory.  However, when canonicalizing
   a large file, there may not be enough quota in the process directory
   to hold a copy of the file.  This control argument allows selection
   of a directory with more quota, and naming of the temporary file.
   If canonicalization is interrupted (by quitting, by a process
   failure or system crash), the temporary file may contain the only
   consistent copy of the data.  The equal convention may be used to
   specify a temporary file name similar to the original file name.
   For example, "-tf ===.canon" creates a temporary file in the working
   directory named after the original file, with a .canon suffix.


Notes:  The command ensures that all characters in a print position are
sorted in the proper order and removes all ASCII carriage return (015)
characters.  When the -otabs control argument is specified, the
canonicalize command replaces blank spaces with the appropriate tab
stops.  Conversely, if the -otabs argument is not specified, horizontal
tab stops are replaced by the correct number of blank spaces.
