03/06/85  forum_add_project, fapj

Syntax as a command:  fapj meeting_name Project_id {-control_args}


Function:  makes users from the project identified by Project_id
eligible to attend the meeting_name meeting.


Arguments:
meeting_name
   is the pathname or entryname of the meeting to be adjusted.
   Pathnames contain greater-than (>) or less-than (<) characters.  If
   a pathname is specified, it identifies the meeting to be adjusted.
   Otherwise, fapj searches for the meeting_name by using the forum
   search list.
Project_id
   is the Project_id for the project to be admitted to the meeting.


Control arguments:
-chairman, -cm
   gives chairman access to the added participant.  This control
   argument is not valid for meetings created with pre-MR11 software.
-read_only, -ro
   allows users on the added project to read transactions but not enter
   them.


Access required:  You can use this request if you have either modify
permision on the containing directory or chairman access to the
meeting.


Notes:  The -read_only and -chairman control arguments cannot both be
specified.

To change the access of a project to read only, use the fapj command
with the -read_only control argument to add the project again.  This
changes the original access to allow users on the project to read
transacrions but not enter them.
