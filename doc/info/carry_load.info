02/12/81  carry_load

Syntax:  carry_load tape_number {-control_args}


Function: Loads a carry tape at its target site.


Arguments:
tape_number
   is the identifier of the tape to be read.


Control arguments:
-comment STR, -com STR
   prints a message STR at the operator's console when asking for the
   tape specified by the tape_number argument or by the previous
   -next_vol control argument. This comment can be used to specify a
   tape identifier at the loading site when it is different from the
   identifier of the same tape at the sending site.
   (See "Examples" below.)
-copy_dir PATH, -cpd PATH
   specifies a directory PATH under which to retrieve copies of any
   files or subtrees that cannot be loaded in place due to lack of
   access or quota. The default directory for copies is:
	>ddd>carry_dir>copies


-force, -fc
   causes the tape to be loaded even if it is more than five days old.
   By default, an old tape is not loaded and an error message is printed.
-next_vol STR, -nxv STR
   specifies the identifier STR of a continuation tape when more than
   one tape was written by an invocation of carry_dump. Multiple
   occurrences of this control argument are allowed. Note that it
   should only be used for continuation tapes. If the tape identifier
   of a continuation tape is different at the loading site than at
   the sending site, the -comment control argument should be used
   after this argument.
-queue_dir PATH, -qd PATH
   specifies the pathname PATH of the carry queue's parent directory
   at the sending site, if different from >ddd>carry_dir.


Notes:
When a request cannot be loaded in place due to access or quota, a
copy is loaded in the directory >ddd>carry_dir>copies. This directory
name replaces the first two levels of the entry's pathname. For example,
if the entry:
     >udd>Demo>JRSmith>tx.archive
cannot be reloaded, the retrieved copy is named:
     >ddd>carry_dir>copies>JRSmith>tx.archive


Examples:
     carry_load 50204 -nxv 50011 -nxv 50012

loads 3 tapes (written by one invocation of carry_dump) in the order
50204, 50011, 50012.

     carry_load 50207 -com TX653 -nxv 50201 -com TX647

loads two tapes written by "carry_dump 50204" at the sending site but
for which the tapes are registered at the loading site as TX653 and
TX647.
