03/26/85 dm_fast_lock_meters

Syntax:  dm_fast_lock_meters {-control_args}


Function:  This command displays metering information about Data Management
fast locking.


Control arguments:
-reset, -rs
   resets the meters to zero and suppresses reporting.
-report_reset, -rr
   reports the current meters then resets them.


Notes:  Data Management fast locking maintains a list of blocks where a block
can contain information on the fast lock or on the waiter of a fast lock.
Adding a block to this list is considered threading in, and removing a block is
considered threading out.  It is possible that an attempt is being made to
thread a block in or out and another process changes the list first.  In this
case the attempt must be retried; each attempt is called a step.
