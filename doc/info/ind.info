Syntax as a command:  ind oldpath {newpath} {-control_args}


Function:  improves the readability of a PL/I source segment by
indenting it according to a set of standard conventions described
below.


Arguments:
oldpath
   is the pathname of the input source segment.  Source segments with
   suffixes for PL/I, create_data_segment, and reductions are
   recognized.  If the segment does not have a recognized suffix,
   indent uses a segment of .pl1, name.cds, or name.rd, in that order.
newpath
   is the pathname of the output source segment.  The output segment
   must have the same suffix as the input segment.  If you omit
   newpath, the indented copy of the program replaces the original one
   in oldpath.  However, if errors are detected during indentation and
   you don't give newpath, the original copy is not replaced; instead,
   the pathname of the temporary file containing the indented copy is
   printed in an error message.


Control arguments:
-brief, -bf
   suppresses warning comments on invalid or non-PL/I characters found
   outside of a string or comment; such characters are never removed.
   When you select -brief, those errors whose warning messages are
   suppressed do not prevent the original copy from being replaced.
-comment STR, -cm STR
   sets the comment column to STR.  Comments are lined up in this
   column unless they occur in the beginning of a line or are preceded
   by a blank line.  If -comment is omitted, the default is 61.


-indent STR, -ind STR
   sets indentation for each level to STR.  Each do, begin, proc, and
   procedure statement indents additional STR spaces until the matching
   end statement is encountered.  If omitted, the default is five.
-lmargin STR, -lm STR
   sets the left margin (indentation for normal program statements) to
   STR.  If omitted, the default is 11.


Notes on conventions:  Declaration statements are indented five spaces
for dcl declarations and 10 for declare declarations.  Identifiers
appearing on different lines of the same declare statement are lined up
under the first identifier on the first line of the statement.
Structure declarations are indented according to level number; after
level two, each additional level is indented two additional spaces.

An additional level of indentation is also provided for the then clause
of an if statement; else clauses are lined up with the corresponding
if.  Statements continuing over more than one line have an additional
five spaces of indentation for the second line and all succeeding ones.


Multiple spaces are replaced by a single space except within strings or
for nonleading spaces and tabs in comments.  Trailing spaces and tabs
are removed from all lines.  Spaces are inserted before left
parentheses, after commas, and around the constructs =, ->, <=, >=, and
^=.  Spaces are deleted if they are found after a left parenthesis or
before a right parenthesis.  Tabs are used wherever possible to
conserve storage in the output segment.

Parentheses are counted and balanced at every semicolon.  If they do
not balance or if the input segment ends in a string or comment, a
warning message is printed.  Language keywords (do, begin, end, etc.)
are recognized only at parenthesis level zero, and most keywords are
recognized only if they appear to begin a statement.


The indent command treats comments which begin with /****^ as
unindentable comments.  These comments are copied directly into the
indented source program without reformatting or indentation.  This
follows the format_pl1 convention for identifying comments which are
never to be reformatted.


Notes on restrictions:  The only case in which indent splits a line is
when lines are longer than 350 characters, since they overflow indent's
buffer size.

Labeled end statements do not close multiple open do statements.

This command assumes that the identifiers begin, end, procedure, proc,
declare, and dcl are reserved words when they appear at the beginning
of a statement.  If the input contains a statement like
   do = do + 1;
indent interprets it to mean that the statement delimits a do group and
does not indent correctly.

Structure level numbers greater than 99 do not indent correctly.
