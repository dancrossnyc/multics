:Entry: continue_to_signal_: 02/06/84  continue_to_signal_


Function: enables an on unit that cannot completely handle a condition
to tell the signalling program, upon its return, to search the stack
for other on units for the condition.  The search continues with the
stack frame immediately preceding the frame for the block containing
the on unit.  However, if a separate on unit for the any_other
condition is established in the same block activation as the caller of
continue_to_signal_, that on unit is invoked before the stack is
searched further.


Syntax:
declare continue_to_signal_ entry (fixed bin(35));
call continue_to_signal_ (code);


Arguments:
code
   is a standard status code and is nonzero if continue_to_signal_ was
   called when no condition was signalled.  (Output)
