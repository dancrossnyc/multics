02/20/80	fig_on.compin

Syntax:  .ifi fig_on


Function:
This compose macro enables the generation of a list of Illustrations
for the Table of Contents.


Notes:
1) If this macro is used in <file>.compin, the desired list of
   Illustrations is accumulated in a segment named <file>.fig.compin.
2) The macro need be used only once for a document, but its repeated
   use does no harm and the segment accumulating the list is not
   changed.  If <book>.compin is a "driver" file that inserts
   <file>.compin as a section and both use this macro, the list of
   Illustrations for <file>.compin will be added to <book>.fig.compin.
3) The macro assumes that the Table of Contents is also enabled and
   formats <file>.fig.compin in such a way that it may be appended to
   <file>.toc.compin (see toc_on.info).
4) See fig.info, fig_get_no.info, and fig_index.info for related
   information.


   Example:
   The following is a sample "book" compin segment named
   AAnn_book.compin.

     .ifi init_mpm "AAnn"
     .ifi toc_on
     .ifi fig_on
     .ifi tab_on
     .ifi AAnn.tp
     .ifi AAnn.pf
     .ifi s1
     .ifi s2
	 .

     .ifi AAnn-book.toc
     .ifi AAnn_book.fig
     .ifi AAnn_book.tab
