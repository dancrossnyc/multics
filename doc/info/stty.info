Syntax:  stty {-control_args}


Function: modifies the terminal type associated with the user's
terminal and/or various parameters associated with terminal I/O.  The
type as specified by this command determines character conversion and
delay timings; it has no effect on communications line control.


Control arguments:
-all, -a
   is the equivalent of specifying the four control arguments -print,
   -print_edit, -print_frame, and -print_delay.
-buffer_size N, -bsize N
   specifies the terminal's buffer size to be used for output block
   acknowledgement where N is the terminal's buffer size in characters.
-brief, -bf
   may only be used with the -print control argument and causes only
   those modes that are on plus those that are not on/off type modes
   (e.g., ll79) to be printed.


-delay STR, -dly STR
   sets the delay timings for the terminal according to STR, which is
   either the word "default" or a string of six decimal values
   separated by commas.  If "default" is specified, the default values
   for the current terminal type and baud rate are used.  The values
   specify vert_nl, horz_nl, const_tab, var_tab, backspace, and vt_ff,
   in that order.  (See "List of delay types" below.)
-edit edit_chars, -ed edit_chars
   changes the input editing characters to those specified by
   edit_chars.  The edit_chars control argument is a 2-character string
   consisting of the erase character and the kill character, in that
   order.	 If the erase character is specified as a blank, the erase
   character is not changed; if the kill character is omitted or
   specified as a blank, the kill character is not changed.


-initial_string, -istr
   transmits the initial string defined for the terminal type to the
   terminal.
-input_flow_control STR, -ifc STR
   sets the input_suspend and input_resume characters to those
   specified in STR, which is a string of one or two characters.
   If STR contains two characters, the first character is the
   input_suspend character and the second one is the input_resume
   character.  If STR contains only one character, it is the
   input_resume character and there is no input_suspend character.
-io_switch STR, -is STR
   specifies that the command be applied to the I/O switch whose name
   is STR.  If this control argument is omitted, the user_i/o switch is
   assumed.


-modes STR
   sets the modes for terminal I/O according to STR, which is a string
   of mode names separated by commas.  Many modes can be optionally
   preceded by "^" to turn the specified mode off.  Modes not specified
   in STR are left unchanged.  For a list of valid mode names, type:
      help tty_modes.gi
-output_etb_ack STR, -oea STR
   sets the output_end_of_block and output_acknowledge characters to
   those specified in STR, which is a string of two characters.  The
   first character of STR is the end_of_block character and the second
   one is the acknowledge character.


-output_suspend_resume STR, -osr STR
   sets the output_suspend and output_resume characters to those
   specified in STR, which is a string of two characters.  The first
   character of STR is the output_suspend character and the second is
   the output_resume character.
-print, -pr
   prints the terminal type and modes on the terminal.  If any other
   control arguments are specified, the type and modes printed reflect
   the result of the command.
-print_delay, -pr_dly
   prints the delay timings for the terminal.
-print_edit, -pr_ed
   prints the input-editing characters for the terminal.


-reset, -rs
   sets the modes to the default modes string for the current terminal
   type.
-terminal_type STR, -ttp STR
   sets the terminal type of the user to STR, where STR can be any one
   of the types defined in the terminal type table (TTT).  The default
   modes for the new terminal type are turned on and the initial string
   for the terminal type, if any, is transmitted to the terminal.
   Refer to the print_terminal_types command for information on
   obtaining a list of terminal types currently in the TTT.


-frame STR, -fr STR
   changes the framing characters used in blk_xfer mode to those
   specified by STR, where STR is a 2-character string consisting of
   the frame-begin and the frame-end character, respectively.  These
   characters must be specified in the character code of the terminal,
   and may be entered as octal escapes, if necessary.  The frame-begin
   character is specified as a NUL character to indicate that there is
   no frame-begin character; the same is true for a frame-end
   character.  These characters have no effect unless blk_xfer mode is
   on.  It is an error to set the frame-end character to NUL if the
   frame-begin character is not also set to NUL.
-print_frame, -pr_fr
   prints the framing characters for the terminal.


List of delay types:
vert_nl
   is the number of delay characters to be output for all newlines to
   allow for the linefeed (-127 <= vert_nl <= 127).  If it is negative,
   its absolute value is the minimum number of characters that must be
   transmitted between two linefeeds (for a device such as a
   TermiNet 1200).
horz_nl
   is a number to be multiplied by the column position to obtain the
   number of delays to be added for the carriage return portion of a
   newline (0 <= horz_nl <= 1).
const_tab
   is the constant portion of the number of delays associated with any
   horizontal tab character (0 <= const_tab <= 127).


var_tab
   is the number of additional delays associated with a horizontal tab
   for each column traversed (0 <= var_tab <= 1).
backspace
   is the number of delays to be output following a backspace character
   (-127 <= backspace <= 127).  If it is negative, its absolute value
   is the number of delays to be output with the first backspace of a
   series only (or a single backspace).
vt_ff
   is the number of delays to be output following a vertical tab or
   formfeed (0 <= vt_ff <= 511).
