10/17/84  display_subsystem_usage

Syntax as a command:
   display_subsystem_usage subsystem_name {-control_args}


Function: displays usage information recorded by a subsystem.


Arguments:
subsystem_name
   is normally the name of the subsystem whose usage information is to
   be displayed (see "Notes on subsystem usage segments" below).


Control arguments:
-first N
   prints only the first N entries; when combined with -reverse, prints
   only the last N entries.  The entries are sorted, if requested,
   before application of -first.  It is incompatible with -totals.
-header, -he
   prints a header defining each column of output.  (Default)
-no_header, -nhe
   suppresses printing of the header.
-no_reverse, -nrv
   prints the entries in the selected order.  (Default)
-reverse, -rv
   prints the entries in reverse order from that selected.


-sort TYPE
   sorts the individual entries before displaying them.  It is
   incompatible with -totals.  (See "List of sorting types" below.)
-totals, -tt
   prints only the total number of invocations of the subsystem without
   listing any individual entries.  It is incompatible with -first and
   -sort.
-user NAME
   prints only those entries for users whose Person_id matches NAME.
   The star convention is allowed.
-version VERSION
   prints only those entries for users who last used the version of the
   subsystem named by VERSION; the star convention is allowed.


List of sorting types: The TYPE given to -sort must be one of the
   following:
count
   sorts by the total number of invocations of the subsystem by the
   user.
date_time_used, dtu
   sorts by the date-time of the last invocation of the subsystem by
   the user.
name
   sorts by the Person_id of the user whose usage is recorded in this
   entry.
version
   sorts by the version number of the subsystem's last version used by
   the user.


Notes: The information displayed by this command for a user of the
subsystem includes
   1. the user's Person_id.
   2. the total number of times the user has used this subsystem.
   3. the version number of the last version of the subsystem used by
      the user.
   4. the number of times the user has used this version of the
      subsystem.
   5. the date-time the user last used the subsystem.


Notes on subsystem usage segments: Subsystem usage information is
recorded in the segment named "subsystem_name.ssusage" (e.g.,
read_mail.ssusage), and you can locate that segment by using the linker
search rules.  If you can't locate it, you can give the pathname of the
subsystem usage segment, with or without the ssusage suffix, as an
argument to this command in addition to the subsystem name.
