Syntax as a command:  convert_forum meeting_name


Function:  converts a pre-MR11 forum meeting to a current version forum
meeting.  The current version meeting is created in the same directory
as the original meeting.  All addnames and the access control list are
copied.  The convert_forum command does not delete the pre-MR11
meeting.


Arguments:
-meeting_name
   is the pathname or entryname of the meeting to be converted.
   Pathnames contain greater-than (>), or less-than (<) characters.  If
   a pathname is specified, it identifies the meeting to be converted.
   Otherwise, the convert_forum searches for the meeting_name by using
   the forum search list.


Access required:  Only the chairman of the meeting can use this
command.
