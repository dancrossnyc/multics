/* DESCRIPTION:
This is the default handler for the system_shutdown_scheduled_ IPS signal.
Currently this handler does nothing, it just returns.

This handler is used by both initialize_process_ for a normal user's
process and by sc_init_ for the Initializer's process.  If you change
this handler to actually do something you may want to make seperate
handlers for these two cases.
