/* DESCRIPTION:

	dm_hphcs_fake_  is  a  version  of  dm_hphcs_ to avoid ring crossing
     problems  in a test Data Management system (DMS); another example of this
     is  dm_hcs_fake_.  Currently, there is only one entry, ips_wakeup, and it
     is  a  no-op (as opposed to trying to get to pxss_ from ring 4).  We also
     use the dm_hphcs_ refname in the proc stmt to emphasis this is a fake.

	This  is  written in PL/I for now and will have to be transferred to
     ALM if more entries are added that need a transfer vector mechanism.
