  84-03-27 Davids: added the forum_version element

  84-05-03 Davids: Changed the length of long_name and short_name from
  24 characters to 32 characters. Version 2 forum names can be 26 characters
  long (forum suffix) - and a little extra incase version 3 uses a shorter
  suffix yet.

  84-09-24 Davids: Added the date_time, npath, and path elements.
