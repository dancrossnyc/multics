/* Notes:

   This include file defines 3 different  character string messages. The first is contained
   in the syserr message pointed to by "msgp". The second is defined by "textp" and "textl".
   The third is defined by "printp" and "printl". The print_syserr_msg_ subroutine never looks at
   the text in the syserr message pointer to by "msgp". It always prints the message
   defined by "printp" and "printl". This may be an "=". If bin_sw is "1"b and octal_sw is "0"b,
   the subroutine requires the real text of the message which is defined by "textp" and
   "textl" to determine how to interpret the binary data. These paramaters should
   be set to the last non "=" message from the log. */
