/* the "author" items must always be the first ones in the table. The
   module which moves the converted table to the System Control process
   fills in these data items and assumes them to be at the head of the segment
   regardless of the specific table's actual declaration. The variables
   "lock" and "last_install_time" used to be "process_id" and "ev_channel"
    respectively. For tables installed in multiple processes, these
    are to be used to lock out multiple installations. */

/*  Lock should be used as a modification lock. Since, in general,
    entries may not be moved in system tables, even by installations,
    it is sufficient for only installers and programs that change threads
    to set or respect the lock. Simply updating data in an entry
    requires no such protection.

    Last_install_time is used by readers of system tables to detect
    installations or other serious modifications. By checking it before
    and after copying a block of data, they can be protected against
    modifications.

    Modules that set the lock should save proc_group_id, and then
    put their group id there for the time they hold the lock.
    if they do not actually install the, they should restore the group id.
