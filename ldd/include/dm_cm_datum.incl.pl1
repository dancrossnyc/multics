/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE dm_cm_datum.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:
        This include file contains the declarations of datum structures.
   There are four tyes of datums: your ordinary, run-of-the-mill datum
   (Datum); a continuation datum (CN Datum), which is a continuation of
   another datum; a continued datum (CD Datum), which is continued (has a
   continuation datum) but is not a continuation itself; and a continued
   continuation datum (CDCN Datum), which is both continued and is a
   continuation.  To illustrate, datums can be pieced combined in the
   following ways:
   
   1) Datum alone.
   
   2) CD Datum -> CN Datum.
   
   3) CD Datum -> CDCN Datum {-> CDCN Datum -> ...-> CDCN Datum} -> CN Datum.

   continued_datum and continued_continuation_datum each contains a header
   which includes the identifier of the datum which is its continuation.
   continued_datum.header.full_length is the length in bits of the entire
   element, i.e., the addition of the length of contents structure component
   of all of the datums from CD Datum to CN Datum.

/* HISTORY:
Written by Matthew Pierret, 02/07/82.
Modified:
03/25/82 by Matthew Pierret: Changed all datum structures to be unaligned.
06/14/82 by Matthew Pierret: Added DATUM_HEADER_LENGTH_IN_BYTES.
08/04/82 by Matthew Pierret: Added DATUM_HEADER_LENGTH_IN_BITS.
10/20/82 by Matthew Pierret:  Split into two include files, this one and
            dm_cm_datum_constants.  The latter holds only and all constants
            formerly in this include file.
10/29/82 by Matthew Pierret:  Removed datum headers.
09/18/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Added DESCRIPTION section.  Added datum and
            continuation_datum (mainly for illustration).
12/03/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Removed the non-based structures
            (cd cdcn)_datum_headers.
