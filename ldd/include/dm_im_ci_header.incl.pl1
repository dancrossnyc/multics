/* DESCRIPTION:

          Each node (control interval) in the index has a header which
     describes the contents of that node.  Although there are two different
     kinds of headers, leaf and branch, they have a great deal in common, the
     common_ci_header.  The common_ci_header states which slots are used by
     the keys (leaf or branch) in the key_range substructure.  There is an
     "upward pointer" to the node's parent branch key (parent_id_string).
     There are pointers to the previous and next nodes (previous_id and
     next_id) on the same level to facilitate rotation of keys, and sequential
     searching.  There is also a count of how much space is in use by the keys.
