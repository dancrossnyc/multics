/* DESCRIPTION:

     This include file contains the basic_esm_info and ordered_esm_info
     structures, as well as constants used to distinguish element storage
     methods.  They are used by several managers to describe the type of
     element storage management to be used in a collection.
*/

/* HISTORY:
Written 02/07/82 by Matthew Pierret.
Modified:
05/17/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Changed name from dm_cm_esm_info (the cm_
            dropped because the include file is used by multiple managers),
            to align structure elements and to add a version string.
