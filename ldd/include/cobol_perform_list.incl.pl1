/*
perform_list_ptr is a pointer upon which the structure
	       perform_list is based.  It is declared in
	         cobol_.incl.pl1.

n	       is the number of COBOL procedures which
	       terminate perform ranges.

perf	       is an array of perform_list.n structures which
	       contain information about end of perform range
	       procedures.

proc_num	       is a tag number by which the end of perform
	       range procedure is identified.

priority	       is the COBOL segment number of the section con-
	       taining COBOL procedure proc_num.

target_a_segno and target_a_offset are the artificial MCOBOL seg-
	       ment number and character offset, respectively,
	       of a 36-bit variable, allocated in the COBOL 
	       data segment on a word boundary, which contains 
	       transfer address information for the alterable  
	       GO contained in COBOL procedure proc_num.

int_tag_no       is an internal tag number assigned to the in-
	       struction to which control is transferred by the
	       end of perform range alterable GO when the pro-
	       cedure which it terminates is not being performed.
