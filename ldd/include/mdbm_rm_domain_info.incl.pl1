/* DESCRIPTION:

   This  structure  is  allocated  in  the  mdbm_rm_db_info.incl.pl1
   static  area,  once per attribute used in a relation in a readied
   file. it is pointed to by the mdbm_rm_attr_info.incl.pl1, and may
   point  to  mdbm_rm_ck_and_group.incl.pl1  if  a  "-check"  option
   boolean expression was declared for this domain. it contains  the
   descriptor  for  this domain data type, and other resultant model
   information.


   HISTORY:

   81-05-06  Rickie  E.  Brinegar:  Modified  ck_proc,  encode_proc,
   decode_proc to be entry variables instead of entry pointers. This
   allows these programs to be written in languages other than pl1.

   81-05-28 Jim Gray : removed unused procedure points,  and  unused
   check  stack  structure  elements.  Also made the descriptors bit
   (36) in this structure, rather than pointers to  the  descriptors
   elsewhere.  Also  removed un-needed redundant assign_ parameters,
   that are actually available in the descriptors.
