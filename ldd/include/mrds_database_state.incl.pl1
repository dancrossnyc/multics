/* HISTORY:

   81-01-20 Jim Gray : original created for the mmi_$get_secured_status interface

*/

/* DESCRIPTION:

   This structure returns the database state (secured or unsecured)
   for determining how commands and subroutines will behave for each case.
   The secured bit was kept separate from the unsecured,
   rather than it's logical "not", to allow for future extensibility
   of database secured states.
