/* HISTORY:

   81-05-06  Rickie  E.  Brinegar: The declaration encd_ptr ptr was changed to
   encd_entry  entry  and encd_proc bit (1) and pad bit (35) were added.  This
   was  done  inoder to permit make use of cu_$generate call and eliminate the
   use of cv_ptr_ to generate entry pointers.

   81-06-01 Jim Gray : removed assn_len and ass_len structure elements,
   as these are not used, with the advent of mu_convert.
