/* DESCRIPTION:

          The subset_specification structure is for selecting items based on
     their membership in subset indexes.  The mapping between the fields of
     the keys of the subset index and the fields of the item is indicated by
     an id_list (identified by subset_specification.subset.id_list_ptr).  An
     item is a member of a subset if there is a key in the subset index which
     is identical in corresponding fields (as specified by the id_list) in the
     item.
*/

            is_member fields together into a flags substructure.
