/* DESCRIPTION:

          The interval_list structure is used to describe a number of
     intervals of keys in an associated typed_vector_array.  With each
     interval is a list of the and_groups from the search_specification used
     to find those keys.  All of the constraints on fields which are specified
     in the and_groups associated with an interval and are in the keys are
     completely satisfied by the keys in the interval.
