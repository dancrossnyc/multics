/* DESCRIPTION:
        The file_access_info structure contains per-process information
   about a DM file.  Each file_access_info structure is one entry in
   the file_access_table.e array.  The entry can be in one of three states:
   not-in-use (file_access_info.entry_state is 0), in-use (entry_state is
   -1) or still in-use, but to be discarded at the end of the transaction
   (any number > 0).  An entry needs to be discarded when the file is 
   completely closed by the user.  This last state is useful because it is 
   better not to discard the entry when it is completely closed until the
   end of the current transaction, so that if the transaction is aborted, the 
   file need not be re-opened to apply the before images.  A list of entries
   to be discarded is maintained using the entry_state variable.
        The file can be in one of three states: exists (file_state = 1), 
   does not exist (file_state = 0), and logically_deleted (file_state = 3).

/* HISTORY:
Written by Jeffrey D. Ives, 10/11/82.
  (Original design by Andre Bensoussan, 01/28/82.)
Modified:
10/05/83 Jeffrey D. Ives: Added fields for lock advice and expanded seg_nums.
07/12/84 by Matthew Pierret: Re-named proc_ad to file_access_info.
12/17/84 by Matthew Pierret: Changed post_transaction_actions sub-structure
            to state, with entry_state (replacing thread) and the new
            file_state.  Added a DESCRIPTION section. Added constants for
            possible file_state values.
