/* modified by Jim Gray - - June/July 1979 to add key/varying attr counts and comments
   Modified by Jim Gray - - April 1980, to add submodel's total_view bit to rel_names.
   Modified by Lindsey Spratt - - August 1980, to add security permission bits to rel/att_names.
   Modified by Jim Gray - - 80-11-06, to change s_perm = append_tuple_perm,
   d_perm = delete_tuple_perm, r_perm = status_perm, m_perm = unused_perm.

   81-01-23 Jim Gray : added bit to att_names so that the resultant can
   be build for partial view submodels, and know whether the last varying attr
   is a character or bit string type, for determining the bit offset of end of tuple.

   81-05-28 Jim Gray : removed structures for foreign key interface.



   NOTE: These structures are used as the parameters in the "mus_get_" routines
   that are called by mu_sec_make_res, to return the users view of
   either the model or submodel he has opened with. */
