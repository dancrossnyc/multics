/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE dm_cm_file_header.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:

        This include file contains the cm_file_header and collection_id_table 
   structure.  These structures are stored as elements in the Header Collection
   of a file and contain per-file, as opposed to per-collection, information.
   
        The cm_file_header structure is always stored in the element whose
   identifier is CM_FILE_HEADER_ELEMENT_ID, declared in 
   dm_cm_hdr_col_ids.incl.pl1.  
   
        The collection_id_table is an array of identifiers of each collection 
   in the file, excepting the Header Collection.  The identifier of a 
   collection is the same as the identifier of the element which holds that
   collection's collection_header, described in dm_cm_collection_header.incl.pl1.
   The identifier of the element in which the collection_id_table is
   stored is cm_file_header.collection_id_table_element_id.
   
      A file also has a reservation map for determining which controls 
   intervals have been reserved by a collection.  It is divided into
   several blocks, or fragments.  The file_reservation_map is actually an
   array of element identifiers of the fragments of the map.  The 
   file_reservation_map is stored in the element whose identifier is 
   cm_file_header.allocation_map_element_id (quite a misnomer).  The number
   of fragments of the map is cm_file_header.number_of_blocks.  The size
   of each is fragment is cm_file_header.number_of_control_intervals_per_block
   bits long, representing equally as many control intervals.  The
   file_reservation_map is described in dm_cm_reservation_map.incl.pl1.
   cm_file_header.highest_numbered_ci is the number of the control
   interval in the file with the highest control interval number.  It is not 
   yet used or maintained.

/* HISTORY:
Written by Matthew Pierret, 03/23/82.
Modified:
04/08/82 by Matthew Pierret: Removed storage method constants.
05/18/82 by Matthew Pierret: Made the array of collections an array of element
            ids referring to collection_header's. Reduced buffer length to 120,
            enough bytes to hold the collmgr_header with 25 collection header
            element ids.
06/03/82 by Matthew Pierret: Added collmgr_header_header.
07/01/82 by Matthew Pierret: Removed collmgr_header_header. Changed to version A
            made fixed length, split off array of collection_ids (also known as
            element_ids of collection_headers).
10/29/82 by Matthew Pierret: Changed from collmgr_header to cm_file_header.
09/18/84 by Matthew Pierret: Added DESCRIPTION section. Moved constants to
            dm_cm_hdr_col_ids.incl.pl1.
