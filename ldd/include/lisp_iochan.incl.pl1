/* This include file describes the format of the 'iochan' block,
   which is used to implement lisp file-objects.  The iochan
   is the central data base of the i/o system.  When open
   is used, an iochan is created in lisp static storage.
   When the lisp environment is booted, 2 iochans for input and
   output on the tty are created.  Iochans are saved and restored
   by the save mechanism */
