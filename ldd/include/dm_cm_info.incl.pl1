/* DESCRIPTION:
        The cm_info structure is used to hold per-process opening information
   about a collection.  It is generally allocated in the process' DM free
   area, as returned by the function get_dm_free_area_.  The opening_manager_
   is used to provide access the cm_info structure, keeping it in a hash
   table keyed on file opening id and collection id combined.
        Currently cm_info is never freed until the process terminates.  Each
   time a new transaction is started, detected when the current transaction
   id of a process differs from cm_info.current_transaction_id, the information
   in cm_info is refreshed.  Storage record information is only refreshed on
   demand, as most modules do not need the information in the storage record.
   Instead, cm_info.storage_record_ptr is set to null (), but 
   cm_info.storage_record_buffer_ptr remains set to the previous value of
   cm_info.storage_record_ptr.  When a refreshed copy of the storage record is
   requested, it is placed at the location pointed to by
   cm_info.storage_record_buffer_ptr, saving the expense of re-allocation.

/* HISTORY:
Written by Matthew Pierret, 10/27/82. 
Modified:
01/25/83 by Matthew Pierret: Changed to version 2.  Added 
            storage_record_buffer_ptr. This points to the storage_record.
            When cm_info is refreshed, storage_record_ptr is set to null,
            but storage_record_buffer_ptr continues to point at where the
            storage_record was. When the storge_record is again requested,
            it is put back in the same place rather than allocating a new
            storage_record.
09/24/84 by Matthew Pierret:  Re-wrote DESCRIPTION section. Removed the
            init clause from the version component.
