/* DESCRIPTION:

   Contains the shutdown_spec structure and the shutdown_info
   structure.  The shutdown_spec structure a reason for a DM
   shutdown, a set of times and a set of delays.  Only times and
   delays which explicitly specified are set, the others are equal to
   0.
   
   The shutdown_spec is processed with the result being a
   shutdown_info structure.  It contains a reason and a set of times.
   The times are either those times specified in the shutdown_spec or
   times calculated from those times using delays.  The delays are
   those specified in the shutdown_spec, or, if not specified,
   default delays.  Default delays are kept in dm_system_data.
