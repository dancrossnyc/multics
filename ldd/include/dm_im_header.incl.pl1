/* DESCRIPTION:

          The index_header structure is stored in the header element of an
     index collection and describes basic information about the index.
*/

/* HISTORY:

Written by Lindsey Spratt, 04/02/82.
Modified:
10/28/82 by Lindsey Spratt:  Changed to version 3.  Added the key_count_array.
	  count(0) is the number of keys in the index.  count(N) is the
	  number of keys in the index which have at least fields 1 through N
	  having the same value as another key in the index, i.e. count(N)
	  is the number of partial duplicates with number of partial
	  duplication fields equal to N.
10/24/84 by Lindsey L. Spratt:  Added a description. Converted to version 4.
	  Replaced the key_count_array with a key_count_array_element_id.
	  Changed the version field to char(8).  Aligned the structure.
