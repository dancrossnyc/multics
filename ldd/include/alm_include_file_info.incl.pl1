/* Begin include file alm_include_file_info.incl.pl1.

   This structure is used for the nodes of a linked list describing the source and
include files processed by the assembler.  Its primary purpose is to save this
information from pass one to pass two to save searching for the include files again.
Enough information is saved to create the standard object segment source file map.
The list nodes are also temporarily threaded (by the stack_back_pointer item) to form
a stack of suspended input files for nested include file use.		*/
