/* Transaction Definition Table for transaction_manager_ */
/* This structure is used to reference the TDT. The process_id field for the
   i'th TDT entry, for example, is usually referenced as tm_tdt.process_id (i).
   A TDT entry is in use by a process when its process_id field is nonzero.
   An entry is reserved by using the stacq builtin to set process_id, if and
   only if it is already zero. The entry is being used for a transaction when
   tm_tdt.txn_id (i) is nonzero. The possible values of tm_tdt.state (i) are
   listed in dm_tm_states.incl.pl1. If state = 0, no operation has been
   performed yet on the transaction. */
