/****^  HISTORY COMMENTS:
  1) change(86-02-27,GWMay), approve(86-03-19,MCR7445), audit(86-10-30,GDixon),
     install(86-11-21,MR12.0-1223):
     added pvindex to the array portion of the structure. The value is used as
     a reverse link to the owner PVs info structure in rldr_data_. Reason for
     adding: vtoc_buffer is now limited to 100 entries and emptied upon
     encountering the end of the input tape volume or when the array fills up.
     The new value makes emptying the array fast and simple.
                                                   END HISTORY COMMENTS */
