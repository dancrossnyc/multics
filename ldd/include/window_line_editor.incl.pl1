/* Begin include file window_line_editor.incl.pl1
   William M. York, February, 1983 */
/* Modified April 1984 by Jon A. Rochlis: Version 2  adds the suppress_redisplay
   flag, to be used when returning from an editor function. */

/****^  HISTORY COMMENTS:
  1) change(2016-05-06,GDixon), approve(2016-06-12,MCR10013),
     audit(2016-06-12,Swenson):
     Version 3 adds new_break_character element to the structure.  This
     provides an alternate method to continue editing after an external
     editor function processes its own input, but needs to return a
     break character for processing by the window_io_ line editor.
     It also adds a redisplay element to the structure.
                                                   END HISTORY COMMENTS */
