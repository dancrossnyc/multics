/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE  dm_fm_postcommit_info.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:

   This include file contains the structures which define the postcommit
   handlers for the creation and deletion of files.  They are used by
   file_manager_$postcommit_do.

   All structure elements are unaligned because we don't trust
   before_journal_manager_ to align the buffer in which it places
   the structure.

Written by Matthew Pierret, 10/16/84.

/****^  HISTORY COMMENTS:
  1) change(87-01-15,Hergert), approve(87-04-01,MCR7632),
     audit(87-01-30,Dupuis), install(87-04-02,MR12.1-1020):
     For TR phx20754. Added element_id so that we can save the id of the
     key_count_array and use it at post commit time, if necessary.
