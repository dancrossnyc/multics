/* DESCRIPTION:
        This include file contains the sys_pn_tbl structure, the 
   file_manager_'s System Pathname Table.  Each file which can possibly
   have a before image current must have an entry in this table. Every
   time this table is modified it is force-written to disk, as its
   correct contents are necessary for rolling back transactions by a
   process other than the process which originally owned the transaction.
   When an entry is inserted, it is force-written twice: the first time with
   the entry filled in but with the "in_use" element set to indicate that the 
   entry is not yet in use; the second time with the "in_use" element set
   to indicate that the entry is in use.  This is done to avoid the possibility
   of a failure while the entry is being written which could successfully
   write the "in_use" but not all of the rest of the entry. "in_use" can have
   one of three values: 0 - not in use; -1 - in use ; +1 - in use but the
   file has been deleted.
