/**** Created 1985-04-16, BIM: from Pandolf's  mseg_access_operation */

/**** NOTES:
      The caller of mseg_ must set mseg_operation.access_operation to record
      the type of access checking it has performed and which mseg_ should
      perform when needed (i.e., for those entrypoints which operate on
      messages like mseg_$read_message).

      mseg_operation.operation is reserved explicitly for use by mseg_ and
      its underlying modules.

      You must also include entry_access_info, mseg_message_info, and
      mbx_wakeup_state along with this include file. */
