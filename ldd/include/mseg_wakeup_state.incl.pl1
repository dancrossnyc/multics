/* Description of the wakeup state of a message segment --

   The wakeup state defines which process, if any, is willing to receive normal or urgent IPC wakeups when a message which
   requests such a wakeup is added to a message segment.  The process is allowed to separately accept or defer normal and
   urgent wakeups.  Note that deferring a wakeup is not the same as not accepting wakeups.  A process is not allowed to
   stop accepting wakeups once it has accepted them as to do so would introduce a relatively high badnwidth covert
   channel.  (In the present implementation, urgent wakeups are really no different from normal wakeups.  Eventually,
   urgent wakeups should be implemented using an IPS signal along with the IPC wakeup).

   mseg_$get_wakeup_state_seg requires that the caller supply the proper value for mseg_wakeup_state.version in the
   mseg_operation.  If there is no wakeup state recorded in the message segment, mseg_$get_wakeup_state_seg will return
   the status code error_table_$messages_off.

   mseg_$set_wakeup_state_seg ignores the values of the access_class, process_id, and lock_id elements supplied by the
   caller in the mseg_operation.  mseg_$set_wakeup_state_seg will, instead, furnish the values of the process making the
   call for these elements and will return these values to its caller.  In other words, mseg_$set_wakeup_state_seg can not
   be used by one process to accept/defer wakeups on behalf of another process. */
