/* Definition of per-message data maintained by read_mail:  This list is maintined in parallel to the mailbox structure by
   read_mail's interface to the mail_system_ mailbox manager (rdm_mailbox_interface_).  It serves two purposes:
      (1) It provides a place to store read_mail-specific per-message data (ie: the processed flag).
      (2) It provides the ability to provide arbitrary mappings between read_mail message numbers and the actual indeces
	within the mailbox structure.  This mapping allows read_mail to preserve its message numbers for an invocation
	even if messages are expunged which causes them to disappear from the mailbox structure (NB: the "expunge"
	request is not yet implemented).  This mapping also allows read_mail to present the messages in the mailbox to
	the user in a different order than they actually appear in the mailbox (eg: sorted by date/time created) */
