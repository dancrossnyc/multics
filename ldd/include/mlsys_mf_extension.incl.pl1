/* Definition of the extension to the mail_format structure used by the Multics Mail System:  When the
   mail_format.canonical flag is ON, the mail_format structure stored in a mailbox contains the canonical form of the
   message; in addition, the following structure is also stored in the mailbox immediately after the mail_format
   structure.  This extension contains information that will be necessary to preserve the performance of context searching
   of a message in future releases.  Said information consists of the location and length within the canonical form of the
   message body, subject, redistribution comments, and user-defined text fields */
