/* Modified 8/21/78 by RDL */

/* Modified 9/11/78 	by RDL to add directive and stmt pointers */

/* Modified 11/4/78		by RDL to add debug,trace,meter switches

   Modified 3/29/79 by RDL to change s_seg_info_ptr to source_seg_ptr

   Modified by Jim Gray - - Jan. 1980, to add flags to disallow blocked files, forieng keys, and restructuring.

   Modified by Jim Gray - - Feb. 1980, to add command level flag for cmdb subroutine interface.

   Modified by Jim Gray - - 80-11-06, to add bit for cmdb -secure option.

   81-05-18 Jim Gray : added bit for max_attributes error message, so that
   it would only be issued on first occurence.

   82-08-19 Davids: added the db_type field.

   83-02-18 Mike Kubicar : Removed the db_type field and added the 
   db_relation_mode_flags substructure to define the modes applicable
   to the database's relations.  Also removed assorted unsed fields
   (names that included the word unused).
