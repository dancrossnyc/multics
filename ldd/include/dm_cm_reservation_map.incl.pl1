/* DESCRIPTION:

        The collection_manager_'s file reservation map is used to keep track of
   those control intervals which have been reserved by a collection so that
   more than one collection in a file do not attempt to use the same control 
   interval.  Logically the file reservation map is one long bit string
   containing a bit for each control interval of the file.  If the bit for
   a control interval is "1"b, that control interval has been reserved.
   Actually the map is divided into several fragments represented by 
   file_reservation_map_fragment structures, each a bit string of uniform
   length and each stored as an element in the Header Collection.  Ideally,
   each fragment is stored in a different control interval of the Header 
   Collection for enhanced concurrent access to the map.
   
        To increase speed of reference and concurrent throughput the fragments
   are not chained together, but are kept track of by the file_reservation_map
   structure.  This structure is an array with each entry describing the
   location of a fragment, the number of the control interval for which the
   first bit in the fragment represents, and a flag which, if on, indicates 
   that there are no unreserved control intervals in the fragment.  This flag
   allows for skipping looking at fragments which are already full.
