/****^  HISTORY COMMENTS:
  1) change(84-11-29,Ranzenbach), approve(86-03-12,MCR7144),
     audit(86-03-12,GWMay), install(86-05-01,MR12.0-1051):
     for version 2. This version allows the caller to specify a pointer to
     the beginning of the offset and its bit count. This allows the
     processing of archive components.
     
     NOTICE:
        All applications which use this structure should be converted to
        use version 2.  Version 1 can be retained by setting the version to
        a value of 1. The constant entry_desc_info_version_1 has been
        removed from the file.
                                                   END HISTORY COMMENTS */
