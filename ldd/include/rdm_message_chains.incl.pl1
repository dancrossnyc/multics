      (1) The first chain is a list of all messages in the mailbox which have not yet been expunged and consists of all
	messages whether or not they have been marked for deletion.
      (2) The second chain is a list of all messages in the mailbox which have not been marked for later deletion.
      (3) The third chain is a list of all messages which have been marked for later deletion.
   The message specifier parser uses one of these three chains as the basis for selecting the messages to be processed by
   a request based on the use of "-include_deleted", "-only_non_deleted", or "-only_deleted", respectively; in this way,
   the amount of code in the parser which must distinguish between these three types of selections is minimized */
