/*
alter_list_ptr is a pointer upon which the structure alter_list
	     is based.  It is declared in mc_.incl.pl1.

n	     is the number of alterable GO's in the source 
	     program.

goto	     is an array of alter_list.n structures containing 
	     information about the alterable GO's.

proc_num	     is the tag number associated with a COBOL procedure
	     containing an alterable GO.

priority	     is the COBOL segment number of the section con-
	     taining COBOL procedure proc_num.

target_a_segno and target_a_offset are the artificial MCOBOL
	     segment number and character offset, respectively,
	     of a 36-bit variable, allocated in the COBOL data
	     segment on a word boundary, which contains trans-
	     fer address information for the alterable GO con-
	     tained in COBOL procedure proc_num.
