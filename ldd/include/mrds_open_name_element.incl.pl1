/* HISTORY:

   81-02-06 Jim Gray : originally created for the mu_open_name_manager
   entry list_all_open_names

*/

/* DESCRIPTION:

   This structure refers to one element in a singly linked list
   of open names for the process. The name list is in collating sequence
   order, and the open type is given along with the open name, and it's length.
   The pointer passed back in the list_all_open_names entry points to the
   first in the name list, by setting mrds_open_name_element_ptr
   to this, the name can be obtained. Then using mrds_open_name_elem.next,
   the next in the list can be seen, until next is a null pointer indicating end of list.
   The open name uniqueness is determined by pl1 comparison rules.
