/* HISTORY:

Written by Benson Margulies, 4/83.
Modified:
04/24/84 by R. Michael Tague:  moved the meters structure definition to
   dm_lm_meters.incl.pl1.  Added this history section.
05/01/84 by R. Michael Tague:  removed the %include dm_lm_meters.
10/17/84 by Stanford S. Cox:  Added version constant, and changed 
   transaction_table to use a refer extent (to allow outer ring reference).
