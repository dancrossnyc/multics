/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE dm_ci_lengths.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:
       This include file contains constants which are the length in bytes
   of the addressable portion of a control interval.  The addressable portion
   is that part of the control interval which callers of file_manager_
   may access, specifically, everything between the end of the control
   interval header (ci_header) and the control interval trailer (ci_trailer).
   Control interval 0 is slightly different, as it also contains an 
   unaddressable portion in which it maintains the file attributes.  For
   control interval 0 the addressable portion is everything between the end
   of the control interval header and the beginning of the file attributes.
