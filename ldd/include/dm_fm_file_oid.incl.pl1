/*  BEGIN INCLUDE FILE: dm_fm_file_oid.incl.pl1 */

/* DESCRIPTION:
        This include file contains the file_oid (file opening identifier)
   structure.  File opening ids are passed across the file_manager_
   interface as bit(36)aligned strings.  The file_oid structure defines
   the contents of the string.  Two components make up a file opening id:
   the index of the file opening in the file_access_table structure, which
   contains per-process information on each file which is open, and the
   last 18 bits of the file's unique id, used for verification of the entry
   in the file_access_table.
