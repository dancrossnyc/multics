/* BEGIN INCLUDE FILE:	dm_fm_file_access_tbl.incl.pl1  */

/* DESCRIPTION:

        This include file contains the file_access_table structure.  This
   is a per-process table which contains one entry for each file which the
   process has open.  The table is set up during per-process initialization 
   and is pointed to by fm_data_$file_access_table_ptr.  The bounds limit
   on the array of entries is abritrary and can be changed.
*/
