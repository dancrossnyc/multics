/* HISTORY:

   81-01-14 Jim Gray : originally created for the dsl_$get_attribute_list interface.

*/

/* DESCRIPTION:

   For a giving database opening via a model or submodel view,
   this structure contains attribute information for a particular relation.
   The number of attributes in this model/submodel view of the relation,
   and the names in both the model and submodel are given
   (these will be the same if opened with a model view)
   The name of the domain for each attribute, and the descriptor
   of the users view of the data type is given, as well as whether the attribute
   can be used as an indexed attribute.

   Access information is also returned for various versions of MRDS security, as follows:

   system_acl entries refers strictly to "rew" type multics acl's.
   for version 3 access info, attr system_acls are the same as the relation acls,
   unless the attribute is inverted, in which case it is the acl
   of the attribute as it appears under the invert_dir in the database.

   mrds_access entries are version dependent, version 3 databases
   with mrds_list/set_delete_acl commands used a mrds specific access
   set of modes of retreive-store-modify-delete.
   version 4 databases released in MR8 had no mrds specific
   access, but used system acl's of "rew".
   version 4 databases for MR9 mrds using submodel security have
   mrds specific access mode of append/delete_tuple for relations,
   and read/modify_attr for attributes.

   effective_access entries use the same units as mrds_access.
   it is the logical result of applying both mrds and system access,
   and coming up with a user effective mode of access to the relation/attribute.
   for version 3 databases, the effective access includes
   in the relation effective access, the effect that access of inverted attributes
   in the invert_dir may have.
