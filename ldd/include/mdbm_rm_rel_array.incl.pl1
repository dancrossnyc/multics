/* HISTORY:

   81-05-28 Jim Gray : added  model_name  and  file_id  as  part  of
   combining   funtions   of   file_array  and  rel_array  into  one
   structure. This will only allow 1 relation per file model now.
   Also changed structure to allow more efficient searching
   via and index builtin, rather than a programmed loop.
   Search is now I = index(string(rm_rel_array.name), "!" || in_name)
   with I = ((I - 1) / 33) + 1 to convert from a char to array index.

/* this structure is allocated in the static are of the structure
   in  mdbm_rm_db_info.incl.pl1,  the secure portion of the database
   resultant  model  upon  opening  the  database.  two  copies  are
   allocated,  one for temporary relations, initially empty, and one
   for relations known to the opener, which has a length  sufficient
   for  all  relations known to the user, but whose names, etc. will
   not be filled  in  until  the  file  containing  that  particular
   relation  is readied. the rm_db_info structure contains a pointer
   to the rel_arrays, and the array entries, when  "readied",  point
   to  the  mdbm_rm_rel_info.incl.pl1  structures  containing  model
   information about the relation, it's attributes, etc. */
