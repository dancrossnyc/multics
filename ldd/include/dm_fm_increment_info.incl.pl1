/* DESCRIPTION:
This structure is passed to the file_manager to describe increment words
to be used in a postcommit handler.  The structure elements have the
following meaning:
increments_ptr  - pointer to the first word of one or more words in the
                  caller's address space that is to be used by a postcommit
	        handler to increment values in a DM file.
number_of_words - The number of increment words pointed to by increments_ptr.
offset_in_bytes - offset from the begining of the control interval to the
	        location in the control interval of the first word to be
	        incremented at postcommit time.
