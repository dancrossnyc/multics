/* DESCRIPTION:

        A storage record is an extension to the collection_header structure.
   It is expected to be more volatile than collection_header and has a 
   different format depending on the control interval storage method in use
   for the collection.  A storage record is stored as an element in the 
   file's Header Collection with the element identifier 
   collection_header.storage_record_element_id.
   
        The unblocked_storage_record contains the control interval numbers
   of the first and last control intervals of a collection.  Unblocked
   control intervals are chained together, so all control intervals can be 
   found by starting at one end and following the chain forward or backward.
   
        The blocked_storage_record is not yet used, as the Blocked Control
   Interval Storage Method is not yet implemented.
