/*
A file key record is created in variable common for any one of several
data items which may be associated with a file name.  The key_type field in
the file key record identifies the type of item for which the record is
created.  The name in a file key record is resolved by the replacement
phase, and a section of the type 9 entry in the name table for the
specified data item is stored in the file key record.  The stored
description is subsequently used by the generator phase.
