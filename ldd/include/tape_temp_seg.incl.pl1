*	This include file defines the temporary segment that is used by the Multics
*	standard tape DIM.  A tape temp segment is created in the user's process
*	directory each time the user attaches a tape.  Note, this include file must be
*	used with the include files:  ios_sdb.incl.pl1, mstd.incl.pl1,
*	mstr.incl.pl1, and tseg.incl.pl1.
